positive	excellent price , delivery and service .
positive	paid no postage or packaging charges .
negative	however , i offered it ti my much younger , hairdresser who was delighted .
positive	annoying_thing is , when you create an order and add a new phone , it shows up on your order list , when you add another one , it doesnt , you have to wait_till the end to review your order and you may have typed in the details to one phone , twice .
neutral	if you find a really good bargain , just don_'_t be too surprised to get a cancel order email a few_days_later .
neutral	handy having someone_else sort_out money .
negative	you can ’_t say it is an admin_charge at this rate .
negative	the link in the email didn_'_t work and the email address it was sent from said it was an unmonitored one - but it was the same email address given to contact the sales / cs_team .
positive	i love mazuma they are so straight_forward on what is working and what isnt , so easy and simple too and pay the same day they recieve the phone !!

negative	badbadbadbadbadbadbadbad
neutral	write as if you ' re_speaking to a friend . the product was fine and competitive but as i live outside the uk i should not have been charged vat i will only use the company again if they make this provision , otherwise i am paying 00_% more than a competitor !
neutral	also the cost of taxi from the villa to the hotel just added stress .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	plus money off our next holiday , never received .
neutral	finding my cabin and navigating around the ship was easy - peasy with staff on - hand to assist those who could get lost in a cupboard .
positive	most of the pool_area and the upstairs bedrooms are now overlooked .
positive	i '_ll be shopping with nightgear again .
neutral	my ordered arrived within a few_days but i thought i had ordered one thing and had recieved the wrong item - i emailed the customer service address and got a reply within_00hrs .

negative	so , i immediately reminded them that new and better smart phones coming out every few_months .
neutral	aussi négocier des contrats au mois avec_les compagnies pour_les clients de_la lcd .
positive	all the meat so_far has_been juicy and lean .
neutral	i also wish it was easier to have a look up function to remind me of previous words and phrases .
negative	the actual bunch was not what i was expecting , i was rather disappointed with the product n the delivery !
neutral	to be fair once i had queried it they expedited the order and i got 0 of the items the next_day .
positive	my 0st experience of buying from ph and i was well pleased with everything from ease of use of the website to the speed in which it arrived .
negative	!
positive	i had no such worries with this company .
neutral	i have had much_better service with other_firms .
positive	so go and be inspired !
neutral	the purchase of my outfit was easy and arrived quickly but the outfit , which was lace up at the front wasn_'_t stitched properly and was not secure even before i put it on .
positive	i '_ve quickly formed the opinion that this company seems to care about the little person - having recently changed and improved their product based on customer feedback .
positive	very friendly and efficient service a phonecall to double_check delivery address and with me within 00_hours of ordering no_drama '_s and no_breakages excellent
negative	trust me i would never ever order anything from them again .
neutral	really disappointed when asked for extra money for flight when promised no extra fees .
negative	i searched the internet for meet and greet services and this one comes up as one .
positive	i highly_reccomend this website .
neutral	any one could have taken them !!
positive	thanks
neutral	a few_days after_placing it i went to the website to see if there was some sort of checking facility .
neutral	took our order and money gave_us a fitting time and then later phoned to say the wouldn_'_t have the tyres and we would need to book / agree to a later date . this has i '_m afraid put a black_mark on our experience .
negative	so they just scan a package in the car but they never go to the address .
positive	i am really pleased with what has_been delivered , it is exactly_what i was looking for and has made the job of fitting the lock onto the gate a whole lot_easier .
positive	how things should be .
negative	poor .
neutral	some quality compromised for a lower price .
negative	at this point , we were out of both items and desperately required replenishment , therefore i cancelled the order , requested my paypal credit and that all my personal_data was removed from their system to prevent any unwanted correspondance , with a confirmation_email when complete .
positive	boots have to be broken in yet but i '_m very happy overall .
neutral	i have used your company about 0 times before and you have always been excellent , very polite and always here very quickly but sadly this time that was not the case as i was initially not given the emergency_number and told that there would not be an apt for about 0_days as you wanted someone to be at home from 0 - 0 and as i work i had to wait but when i was given the emergency_number i thought that i would phone them and was told i could have an apt in 0_days instead having been told there were none available a few mins before .
neutral	sound and light indicator does not work despite batteries being supplied . not sure why . have checked everything i can .
neutral	sent one email with pictures attached didnt get reply phoned and was told that the reason i had not had a reply was that they had been very busy i then sent another email and still didnt get a reply so i phoned them again a week_later still to be told that they have been busy i told them i needed a reply to my email i was told they would look into this next_day still no reply to my email phoned again and spoke to another person and they would look into it i finally got a response later that morning and purchased some runners that they thought would fit they arrived 0_days_later .
neutral	but after a lot of the stores were done up and it seemed like half the products disappeared .
neutral	however all seems well now that it is up and running , even if i did have to fit some extras myself !
negative	i am now paying fifty_pounds to have this mattress taken_away , i would unquestionably not recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	i '_ve ordered the same product , a calendar , from several different companies and in terms of value for money i found photoworld was very average .
neutral	i emailed these over and waited to hear back .
negative	staff reflect their surroundings and dont care either .
positive	payplan have been heaven sent .
positive	good products .
negative	netflix is far better .
neutral	phoned the supplier as there was no contact number for the delivery service to be told that someone called thomas had refused the goods - they had obviously gone to the wrong_address .
negative	in view of the miserable experience i have had with fs , i have requested the faulty item be returned .
negative	selected a delivery date for 0nd of june ( just in time for the jubilee_celebrations ).
neutral	these emails were delivered to my one . com inbox by the one . com email servers .
positive	i managed to find my item at a good price on active_beauty and the ordering was simple .
positive	fitted my tyre at my workplace at the time we arranged with no_fuss .
negative	so wowcher are saying that it was after we bought & paid in full for the deal & booked the accommodation we were then informed of the fact we needed our flight information .
neutral	as we are pensioners the salesperson makes you believe such a good deal speaking so fast its difficult to understand .
negative	curt with no sign of respect .

negative	i always found the old website easy to navigate .
positive	i experienced the advice given as thoughtful and tailored to my needs with a good level of consideration about my personal_circumstances .
neutral	what a waste of their time and mine .
negative	i take great umbridge to being subjected to these awful television adverts that are only there to imprint those numbers into your brain at the exclusion of other good companies that cant_afford the advertising .
positive	lenson kept me updated by text so i knew when my order had been confirmed and dispatched .
positive	found exactly_what i was looking for , placed my order , paid and delivery arrived 0 days_later .
neutral	they could not and would not understand that i had no way of contacting them as i didn_'_t remember their company name and strangely_enough , i don_'_t carry around all of the paperwork associated with work on my property .
positive	easy to use website .
positive	bought zoomed reptile light tubes .
positive	would use them again anytime !
negative	i then asked about the ' 000_% satisfaction_guaranteed ' slogan emblazoned across their website alongside the ' guaranteed sunday delivery .'
negative	thank_god it was postage free
positive	already put in more orders , very good selection of stock , keep_up the great work !
positive	i selected and tried a small selection of jeans delivered to my door .
positive	as promised , this morning we received a call from sandra , our account_manager and she talked us through our plan management programme .
neutral	in addition the guy i spoke to was conciliatory and , had i pursued things , may have sorted_out a replacement but i decided not to .
positive	initially i was unsure_about buying my husbands_favourite_aftershave via this website because it was so much_cheaper_than in the store and i was concerned that it was the genuine product .
neutral	i have bought some excellent items from wowcher which were delivered speedily and of good quality .
positive	quick despatch .

neutral	morning of the 00th and it has just arrived .
positive	had no_problems dealing_with this company , would use them again and recommend them to others .
neutral	they could not deliver products as they promosed .
negative	someone did reply and told me a refund would be made and when i chased them four weeks_later he told me he could not tell me when a refund would be made .
negative	the 00th of june ( just in time for fathers_day ).
neutral	obviously if i had been able to view these products before buying i would not have bought them .
neutral	blue_chip offered to pay for a dongle ( although they never called back to confirm this despite saying they would ) but the owners eventually replied the next_day and put a booster in the property which did enhance the signal and enabled_us to have contact with our family at christmas .
neutral	prompt delivery but ended_up phoning order through after 0 failed_attempts on website ( have not had issue previously ).
negative	never again , and i '_m going to advertise the problem i had to make_sure as many people as possible are aware of the way this company goes about their business .
negative	i will never ever use them again and i strongly advice people to do the same .
positive	will buy again .
negative	certainly not the level of customer service likely to result in repeat business which is disappointing since i was a third time customer .
positive	very fast service , despite there being a bank_holiday in between .
negative	gumtree , i will not be using you again .
positive	they had what i wanted , it came quickly .
negative	the fact is that i preordered my ps0 over a month in advance with guaranteed delivery before_xmas ( guaranteed mind you !)
positive	ordered a xbox kinect at 0pm on monday_evening and it arrived 00am the next_day ( in the christmas week ).
neutral	anyway , fast delivery , good price , good communication , etc .
negative	poor control and integrity of ordering on website can '_t be trusted . avoid !
negative	they are taking £_000 cancelation fee for the three nights he didn_'_t stop in a hotel that wasn_'_t booked in the first place .
negative	stating lack of proof of purchase .
positive	i have tried a number of online stores but this is the only place i would recommend without_hesitation .
positive	great price and fast delivery
positive	the value was much_better_than ebay sales so i registered and received my postage paid_envelope the next_morning .
negative	00rd_jan_0000 :
negative	i am still chasing them for a refund - they are quick enough to take my money but it will take 0 - 00 days to return it - and i am still_waiting for the promised email about how to complain_about their appalling customer service .
negative	no answer to my numerous_emails . tried there online help service . thats a joke . and as for tying to get an answer on the phone . am i sick of hearing ' i '_m sorry ' etc . will just have to order them from elsewhere and take the financial hit . lesson_learned . never use this company .
negative	i '_ll keep phoning and get angrier and angrier until something is sorted .
neutral	sadly since last_year the depot equipment has_been changed so you could no_longer fit the lwb van in as they did last_year .
neutral	ordering and delivery were very good .
neutral	have recommended to a friend already .
positive	easy purchase , quick delivery , fantastic quality item , great value .
positive	thank_you for making this an easy way to start the holiday and a relaxing end to just have the car there waiting .
neutral	yodel ( need i say more !!!!!)
negative	we are a pub holding company who run a number of sites across the country for varying lengths of time .
neutral	perhaps - but it certainly wasn_'_t that easy to negotiate .
positive	great online buying experience
negative	it bothers me because it detracts from all the really really horrible experiences that so very many people are having at the hands of this terrible company .
positive	thank_you very very very much .
neutral	the site has loads of choice which is great .
positive	the staff at stanstead were fantastic !
positive	job_done !
negative	so i track it down , and request delivery 0 days_later knowing i '_ll be away for 0 days - and they just dump it on the doorstep while we ' re away !
positive	i would certainly buy from pediwear again and recommend this company without_reservation to others .
positive	!
negative	customer service is extra .
neutral	i replied that pro_cook were the ones who had contracted fedex to carry their goods and therefore it was for them to review the practices .
negative	?
positive	can '_t really ask for much more than that !
negative	i then contacted bt to ask why i was able to submit my card info to them for an item which had been_discontinued .
negative	they advised me they had not heard a word from iflorist and that the order they received was for $_00 aud which at the time and exchange_rate would have been £_00 . meaning iflorist kept £_00 for themselves . yes . as good as half the amount i paid .
negative	i explained that i had had to buy a new hairdryer as i couldn_'_t manage without one , but was told i could not have a refund or another product , and there is no estimated timescale for a resolution for the manufacturer .
negative	sainsbury '_s or tesco '_s for me from now on .
positive	i was assigned a project manager , peter , who sorted_out all the different tradesmen that were needed and was a good point of contact throughout .
neutral	to print a copy of what '_s relevant requires printing a great deal of what '_s not relevant .
positive	sound website , good and interesting products , speedy delivery .
negative	this company are the worst ever - do not go with them .
positive	excellent service .
neutral	the delivery company delivered them to a completely_different address , not even on the road where i live .
positive	was unsure if this was legit to start with .
neutral	once again , i feel as though i went through a drawn_out process , when in the past the delivery came rather briskly with no further intervention by myself .
negative	“ five pounds and fifty pence ?!
positive	the entire_process , from visiting the website and selecting my mobile_phones to receiving payment was extremely easy .
neutral	after that we had a good lads night out on the town .
negative	christmas_presents for 00 year_olds .
negative	sent email on saturday_evening .
negative	!
negative	after doing all the usual shenanigans to understand their web - site and after their system taking money from my credit_card , they phone up to say " sorry the tyre are out of stock " - meanwhile , i have arranged to have time off to drive to their nominated fitter .
positive	so easy !
neutral	so as you can see communication is not satisfactory for myself but there again i am used to japanese service ,
neutral	booked the car in may , got to the airport then was told the car that we had booked was not available and was told that we had to take a smaller car , not good with 0kids 0adults 0hand luggage 0suitcases , good news after 00_minutes of stand off managed to find us a nice little upgrade convenient but appreciated , thanks
positive	the process itself was made very easy , particularly helpful in indicating which forms , and sections of forms , had to be completed .
positive	i first emailed them for advice on what memory i needed for my old nec computer .
neutral	we first purchased compatible_inks from you for our lexmark_printer , which was a bit of a disaster , the colour on our children , s homework was dreadful with half of the colours not being there .
negative	i got a reply within 0 days saying it has_been passed to another team and they will reply in 00 days !!
neutral	agent has promised to ring back in 00mins with maybe correction , i do hope so .
negative	they sent my order to a different address and when the people from where it was delivered to some what eight and half hours_later when i got the meat it had all gone and was stinking £_000_pound gone and no one is taking the blame both party '_s have aid not there fault will be seeking_legal_advice
neutral	was happy with the service provided .
positive	i would recommend the company
neutral	bit of a pain as it was a birthday_present so i had to go out and buy a replacement .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid .
positive	the videos are very useful in helping to make choices as are people '_s reviews but remembering that everyone '_s needs are different so negatives for one person may not apply to others .
negative	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
positive	an all_round ***** service .
neutral	missing hot_rods but these were sent out by fedex next_day .
neutral	then i was told my order would be shipped the next_day but it wasn_'_t until a week_later , when i enquired if my order had shipped , that dhl picked it up .
neutral	so i had the booking_reference_number .
neutral	also when querying the delivery issue to the customer service team they didn_'_t offer much help instead just tried to fob you off .
positive	it was great value for money too !
neutral	i also like the seasonal products ( christmas cards , easter_eggs .).
negative	my puppy cake mix has exploded all over the new toy and dog_food .
negative	i had had to call as difficult to see on their website .
negative	for some customers it looks like a way of life not a mobile service provider lol .
neutral	had to wait nearly 00_mins for the driver to arrive on arrival at airport .
positive	very good nice and absolutly perfect i like to say other to come and play .
positive	both men very pleasant and helpful after scuffing the walls .
neutral	i really do believe that diet_chef should have better controls in place to ensure that goods are sent out correctly and in good order , and i shouldn_'_t have to be contacting them to put things right .
negative	so they fail on three levels :
neutral	this event did spoil our holiday .
negative	paypal wasn_'_t succesful on ur site !
negative	they included poor quality workmanship , bad service , poor products , zero communication .
neutral	that being said , when the watch finally arrived it was in perfect_condition in the box , a beautiful watch , and watchtown provided the cheapest website online , even cheaper_than amazon
positive	good job .
negative	flowers turned_up on the 00th despite the guaranteed 0pm delivery for the 00th !!
positive	would recommend medisave to friends , family and work colleuges .
neutral	wont_be booking through ferries . co . uk again as a friend booked direct and was able to make_changes at no cost .
positive	i now know rs where to get the tights i need .
positive	i found a pair of oakley_sunglasses at lanaca airport but didn_'_t have enough time to purchase them so i decided to look for them on line when i arrived home that '_s when i found rx_sport not only were they significantly_cheaper_than the duty_free price £_00 to be exact the delivery was free and i received my glasses in a well_packaged box 0 days_later .
positive	my order came very quickly .
neutral	i got a text to say they had been left_securely , but was then surprised not to get a thank_you from the recipient .
neutral	we did think about doing it but there was no obvious link ?
negative	none of these days were possible due to work / commitments .
neutral	my order was for several products ( was considering repeat_orders , but thinking twice_now ) and one reason i choose complete_care shop over other_sellers was for its fast delivery , hence the reliability that comes from that , which we all need and look for when we shop on - line , especially when its to do with care and the need for products asap !!!
negative	we received a call the friday prior to advise that due to personal issues the fitter would not be available , and installation had to be changed to friday of that week , annoying as i had already taken the day off work but couldn_'_t be helped .
negative	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
neutral	the only real disappointment was the way they were packed up for delivery .
negative	the goods were ordered on the 00th of december .
positive	exactly_what i wanted at the right price .
positive	we had to wait a short time for another flight to arrive for a couple to join our coach but we were dropped_off first .
neutral	when the product arrived it was exactly as expected .
neutral	i don_` t know if the mats were for a different model of fiesta or just bad production .
neutral	it '_s good to know you have nearly everything i need .
negative	the company are now spaming me with emails about their special_offers .
positive	items .
negative	i was told the error was my fault , even thought i was told it had been cancelled when i phoned and that it was my responsibility to be charged for something i never received or used .
negative	they have taken the money from my account , i still don_'_t have the products & they are refusing to even make an enquiry until the products have been missing for 0_weeks !
positive	efficient , quick service .
positive	great company to purchase from .
negative	they are a disgrace .
negative	no replies to mails .
negative	no - one ever returned her call and she had to call them back .
negative	if the movers are unreliable or careless , you ' re left trying to chase them on your own for money or compensation .
positive	i was very pleased with the offer , the price , and service which was very professional .
positive	ordered a back friend at about 0pm in the afternoon online .
neutral	i have proof of postage .
negative	miss leading would not use again .
negative	the other bunch was christmas tulips with thistles .
negative	absolutely no_fuss or trouble at all .
positive	i was very impressed by the speed of the whole_process , from the clear_instructions at the start to the money being in the bank in a matter of days !
negative	having bought and paid for items . still have not received them .
negative	i have now put a claim into my credit_card company to get a refund .
neutral	the hotel was easy to find and would be ideal for anyone arriving by train although there was also ample free car_parking .
neutral	!
positive	ordering was simple made easy by the informative web_site , communication about delivery / dates was spot_on and the speed it took for my goods to arrive was second to none . i will use this company again .
negative	they are liars and crooks !!!
negative	i was unable to speak to anyone in england and was continually put through to call_centers in india and south_africa .
neutral	i '_ve been a buyer and seller on ebay since 0000 .
negative	i ordered an oak exterior door which was advertised as mortice and tenon construction but when it arrived it was dowelling construction . my joiner emphasized that dowelling construction is inferior to mortice and tenon so we were very annoyed that it was incorrectly advertised . we then had all the inconvenience of the door in our hall until it was collectedi i will point out at this stage that this door was very poorly_packaged and was consequently damaged in transit . meanwhile we had also ordered an oak weatherboard seperately to match the oak door . when that arrived it was a hardwood weatherboard and so we had to tell them that the wrong weatherboard had been sent .
positive	quick delivery and professional service .
neutral	i would use iflorest again .
negative	absolute disgusting service .
positive	would definitely use again .
negative	the whole exasperating experience has left me so frustrated , i am struggling to write this review .
positive	the cover for the tailgate is brilliant idea
positive	i '_ve had a number of compliments about them and people can '_t_believe_how little they cost .
positive	the help i received was fantatsic , even when i must have asked about a 0000 questions !
negative	got an email tonight calling me a liar !
positive	even_though i am not very competent with a computer , i managed to put_together very acceptable photo_books that we can conveniently pick_up at any time .
neutral	i '_m afraid i shan '_t be re - ordering in_spite of the good price .
positive	i was really impressed with how cleverly it was put_together and so realistic .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	i didnt reveive my order yet
neutral	thanks
negative	i have tried to call them , but the customer service is shut ( perhaps due to the time difference_between uk and spain , although it is a uk support number ).
neutral	i asked for reserved_seats for my first booking .
negative	every week i had the same message back " we apologise for the delay , we expect the item to be with you by next week ".
positive	i would definately recommend this website to others .
positive	loved this chemists so much choice and very affordable items . will be back again for sure !!
negative	most equipment they give you is pants .
neutral	i got my money , full_amount .
positive	the packaging of the decanter was considerable - it almost took me longer to open than it did for wineware to deliver !
neutral	but - couriers !
neutral	the web tracking just said i was in the queue for packing with no time - scale indicated .
positive	the ordinary earplugs you can get from the pharmacies have no comparison with the quality of the snorestore products .
positive	came on here for a birthday_present and it was a bargain .
negative	on calling interparcel . com i was told that the tnt driver had reported at 0pm that the road was closed and no access was possible .
neutral	some items are a bargin others no cheaper_than elsewhere
positive	thanks
positive	only used one so far seems very good and nice look .
positive	in fact i '_m so impressed that i '_m writing this review in the lounge on the new computer !
neutral	by 0 : 00 p . m . ( after yet another phone_call to interparcel ) there was still no collection so i phoned ups myself ( something that interparcel don_'_t seem to be able to do ) and ups said that no collection had been scheduled for either day .
negative	no one can dive a car and return it empty , this is impossible for obvious_reasons , at the best there would be 0 litres left in the tank .
neutral	i didnt even receive my dispatched confirmation_email until late on the next_day , so find the stat if 00_% very hard to believe , i will now not be home when it gets delivered so do not know when i will receive parcel .
positive	everything was as it should be .
positive	completely pleased with my purchase and the service provided .
positive	have used rock_+ run many_times and always had the same great service .
neutral	i needed to put it into my mum '_s fridge as soon as possible so i have not tried to return it for replacement , it still is functional .
neutral	the picture_showed on the website put what actually arrived too shame .
neutral	i filled in the details of the parcel : dimensions and weight ( 0kg ) and clicked the find results button .
negative	i was told they would submit a report and we ' d hear the outcome within " 0 - 0 working_days ".
positive	then i realised i ' d failed to mention the second order , so i emailed him back with that and he ' d already done it !
positive	it '_s my first time to send remittance thru you and i would say . will_definitely do it again .
negative	i understand that delivery time from u . s to u . k will be little_longer_than normal but i paid over $_00 . 00 for delivery so i am expecting better service than i already have received .
negative	not exactly the response you '_d expect when asking an employee a question_regarding their service and company .
negative	avoid these jokers .
positive	i used standard delivery and goods arrived within 0 working_days .
neutral	i could not even see where to swipe my card as it was so dark .
positive	fab customer service too .
neutral	our couch is elephant cord fabric and the only issue with it is that it loses it '_s pile quite quickly on the arms despite following the recommended care regime .
positive	i had ordered this and it came within 0 week .
negative	do not buy !!!!!
positive	the glasses were well_packaged and appear so far to be durable and of good quality .
positive	this product is the best on the market .
negative	?
negative	so i placed an order again and it seemed to work .
neutral	another occasion managed to get a great deal on a lovely hotel / weekend away .
neutral	rather annoyingly she arrived at 0 : 00 am on the morning of our departure which was not helpful as we had allowed until 00 : 00 am to pack and leave for the airport .
positive	excellent service from initial phone_call to speedy delivery of well priced products , just wish they had more things i needed !
negative	considering ftp is a corner stone of web_hosting , you would think this would be a priority issue that they would address quickly , but apparently not .
positive	would recommend .
negative	my delivery actually required me personally to sign for my delivery , and to show my photo id too , now since i have both my passport and driving_license , obviously whoever " signed " for my parcel couldn_'_t have showed my id .
neutral	follow_up
positive	first time i have used this service .
negative	!
negative	a shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts .
negative	shame i have to pick a start and no half of it
negative	needless to say i came back and emailed them .
negative	needless to say that a few items were badly_damaged and dates were terrible . so i rang up my local_store and one of the girls were extremely rude , i ordered to speak to the store manager and he ordered the forgot shopping back to my house and also gave_me a full_refund .
positive	i have had 0 or 0 different items and they are all up to expectation .

neutral	good service
neutral	it '_s simple to manoeuvre your way around their pages and booking couldn_'_t be simpler .
positive	just what i needed , chair ordered thursday_evening , delivered on time monday .
negative	all reputations seem to be based on a particularly spurious " feedback " system , in which someone moving their entire home to another town is given equal weight to someone_who just needs something moved up the road .
neutral	i am an_avid user of virgin trains due to being around 0 hours away from home whilst at university .
negative	pitiful worthless excuses were given in abundance and the goal post of blame being shifted to someone_else '_s pitch .

neutral	some of the flowers had ' wilted ', which spoiled the effect of the whole display .
negative	it '_s forum staff are generally crap and just spout rubbish about being different and don_'_t seem to understand that they need to actually deliver a good mobile service not just talk it up .

positive	good local professional company that i would recommend and use again .
positive	every thing worked as it should will recommend to friends and use again
neutral	await delivery of the correct one .
neutral	the sofas were very grubby , we could not sit on them without towels .
negative	they can take us to court now if they wish and they will have to explain this utter lack of competency , continuous ignorance and complete_lack of attention , care and responsibility as a uk energy_supplier to the judge .
negative	i received an email on the 00th of april informing_me that the item was out of stock .
negative	yet another thing today monday 00th_jan the thumbnails are showing pictures of last weeks episodes .
positive	i spent_ages looking for some new frames for my updated prescription - traipsed around all the local high_street shops but found nothing i liked .

negative	i keep being asked to review an item i havent received yet .
neutral	but put the phone down if they try to offer you an early upgrade .

neutral	seems they got my flowers mixed with somebody elses ?
neutral	!
neutral	a few_days_later i got an email_saying that they were out of stock and it would be another week , nearly 0_weeks_later and after having to chase them a few_times on phone to see what was happening they set a date and it was delivered unfortunately it had a large_dent in one side so was returned and then redelivered a few_days_later , i found it annoying that it was me having to make the calls and chase for info rather_than the other way round .
negative	due to the terrible service i received i asked for the price of the tv to be reduced to the now lower price being offered online and that i get a full_refund for the delivery cost .
positive	there prices do not stack up in comparison .
positive	each time i '_ve posted my phone off , i '_ve had the money in my account the day they received it .
negative	they also did not follow the instructions of the householder clearly_displayed on her front_door to deliver to the neighbour in the event of no answer .
neutral	i downloaded the software as instructed , which was easy to do .
positive	the website is good , albeit a bit busy in parts , but you can find what you are looking for in the end .

positive	highly_recommend .
neutral	i ordered a top - of - the - range washer_/ dryer from electricshop .
negative	first_attempt in my view ) so we shall see .
neutral	the lesson here is to shop around however much you trust someone .
negative	correspondence followed with the supplier offering a discount on my next order , this was then later increased to a higher percentage none of which was relevant as i had no_intention of ordering from them again anyway .
neutral	whisky was a gift so have not drunk it !
negative	several days_later we were told that the bed will be with us on 00th_august .

neutral	both tags stated the same size however my partner then revealed a medium_size sticker had been placed on top of the pair that were the small size , disappointing really at £_00 . 00 a pair , but seeing as i was away suffered the consequences and had to use them .
negative	and now to top it off you have started free delivery to store again so i have needlessly spent on delivery .
negative	i do not recommend buying anything from them , especially not expensive products .
neutral	worse , they didn_'_t care .
positive	i use your services for all material iof this nature , my inly complaint is not having acounts will set discount for loyal_customers .

positive	i ordered a spare shelf for a unit i previously bought from justtvstands .

negative	eventually i got tired and gave o0 a call .
positive	my polti 000 was delivered in perfect_condition only 00_hours from ordering - you can '_t beat that .
negative	the couriers and staff at the hub really need to take more care and until they can get that sorted i will switch to myhermes .
neutral	this meant i had to wait for another 00 days before i could get the piece of equipment for which i had paid .
negative	then when i did get a call back at 0pm he said that they will bump my service to next_day delivery and all should be well .

positive	no problem , delivered in two_days .
negative	they have listed the " direct sight returns_policy " incorrectly on their website , stating that you will receive a refund as long as your items are returned in their original condition .
neutral	it was very fortunate that the wife arrived home at that very same time .
neutral	the site is a bit_annoying to use ; it '_s very , very slow and any product with an asterisk in the name can '_t be viewed without some l00t h0x0r skills .

neutral	i had no_problems with the car which was new and in a very good condition and in a good price i believe .
negative	it was a letter saying they had canceled my reservation of the number i had ordered as they had not recived my payment or documents and the money i have payed is non_refundable ( wonder_how many time this happens ) so i phoned them up and got told that if i payed more money thay could hold the number_plate for me as the though i did not want to go threw with the sale ( why would i have payed the deposit if i did not want it ) so not only do i have to now pay for a replacement log_book and mot but have to pay the again for the number_plate think not as i have 0 plates from other_companys and never had to send them any documents off just payed for them and got the paperwork threw post then a trip to dvla and hay_presto number_plates changed so all in all it not aways the cheapest the best all i was saving was fourty pounds than a other site i have used in the past but now its cost me my deposit the cost of a replacment log_book and mot
positive	goods all well_packaged .
negative	i ordered for the first time last_week and the sign i ordered for my bar is incorrect as in the weights and measures page of the catalogue . i was told i would be called back and rectified but i still_haven_'_t heard from you .
neutral	ordered on monday , received next monday .
positive	ray could not have done enough to help , with all the changes we made , he never once became flustered .
neutral	loaded_onto perth van
neutral	i will use the company again although the payment is sometimes very little and you have to find numerous books in order to raise the £_00 minimum .
positive	the amp was nicely_boxed up and protected , my son spent no time setting it up and played for 0 hours non stop .
neutral	ive started useing parcel_monkey to send parcels as i found them to be cheeper
positive	i filled in the form online , and within a few_days received a box and instructions on how to send off my glasses .
negative	i had to leave for work so they promised that someone would be in touch to rearrange same day delivery .
neutral	delivery was scheduled for friday 00th_march as agreed .
negative	enough is enough !
positive	the website is well_designed and easy to navigate , the service was quick , i got what i ordered the next_day and it was a good price .
negative	no , i was not .
negative	this number was not recognised .
negative	so now the dress is just lying in my wardrobe since i can '_t get myself to throw it away when i payed a lot ( for a student like me ) of money for it .
positive	from selling my phone to receiving payment the full process only took around a week .
positive	ordering was simple and quick .
positive	very good service internet service is great .
negative	as i have returned my costume and sent numerous_emails with no reply from escapade i would not use this seller again
neutral	some of the paper was boxed the other were in a plastic_bag which_resulted_in corners being damaged
positive	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
neutral	i '_ve_used p0g several_times , never having had a problem .
negative	i rang shedstore the day before to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
neutral	please get it right , as i would like to order again .
positive	great website !
positive	excellent and prompt delivery would use this company again
positive	i recommend them to everybody .
positive	great speedy service and the key worked with no issues at all .
negative	how they get away with it i '_ll never know .
negative	out of respect at this stage i have chosen not to mention names of the conversations i had when and with who .
neutral	.
negative	takes 00 working_days to hear back from customer service when chasing items and then another 00 working_days to book in a collection of an item .
negative	!
positive	!
positive	its clear he '_s an enthusiast .
neutral	it took a couple of weeks to get it all sorted , which was ridiculous .
neutral	interestingly the manager denied that the on line sale was anything to do with national and that it was different company , still , they offer £_00 for loosing a day of work , most generous .
neutral	we need to try cloths on its a simple fact of purchasing .
neutral	upon realising the problem i phoned the garage from where i picked the vehicle , telling them i would return the vehicle later today where i obviously would pay what i owed , however i was not expecting to pay an additional_insurance of £_00 which i did not ask or sign for ?
negative	( p . s i do not see why i have to pay for return postage and nothing was said in regards to the other pair which are useless and unwearable and neither of the issues are my fault as i bought them both in good faith !! )
positive	the range is massive and i found myself looking at sunglasses for myself too !
negative	took my wife forever to put the photobook together .
negative	playing ping_pong with a laptop .
negative	no communication .
negative	in 0 minute chunks - carrying the phone on ' speaker ' - even into the loo !
positive	very happy with the purchase .
positive	exactly_what was ordered arrived .
negative	havent got anything , will be getting a refund asap
positive	very impressed with webtogs !
negative	i said that i would be available saturday_morning ( the next_day ) before 00 as i was away for the weekend or after 0 in the week ( it also stated on the card that they deliver between 0 . 00 and 0pm ).
positive	i have saved a lot of money on my tyres and it all seems to be effortless so_far and i even managed to get straight through to an advisor at this time which made me really happy .
neutral	this ended with a request for my bank details which i declined to provide .
neutral	however i have had a problem with one supplier - the beauty challenge who initially failed to deliver any of the 0 items i ordered as xmas_gifts for my 0 kids - then after much chasing delivered three ( which i can '_t use as i need one for each ) - but is now not responding to emails or answering phone_calls about the missing two - i have called repeatedly every day for 00 days .
negative	herudover sendte faktureringssystemet en uheldig meddelelse ud til_alle kunder , at der ikke var dækning på ens kreditkort og at de_ikke kunne trække beløbet som iøvrigt også var forkert og ikke fratrukket den rabat der_var gældende den dag jeg_var i butikken for at købe min lampe .
negative	it '_s a real_shame , was looking_forward to getting the watch off of my daughter for father '_s day
positive	would definitely recommend and will use again
neutral	if you can avoid it , don_'_t order online with them , all you will get at the least is long delays for your item to come .
neutral	despite an aim to respond within_00hrs .
neutral	i have not been informed of this is writing and the girl who informed me on the phone was unapologetic of my cancelled appointments and not very polite .
negative	that didn_'_t work as the firmware on the tv was actually later than the one on the stick .
positive	an excellent choice of frames , easy to select what i wanted without having to endure going into_town .
neutral	i had a pre_oiled and undermount sink_cut out .
positive	needed a 0 . 0 ton trailer collected from croma norfolk the map said you may have to walk the last 0 miles strange but true that aside i searched the net found any van put in the details withina hour i had quotes and reasonable quotes at that i accepted one thinking hear starts the questioning and teeth sucking and the didn_'_t relies it was their and how big wide klong it was and why didn_'_t you tell me it wasn_'_t made off and oh no its one of them !!
neutral	it was good to receive texts and e_mails_telling_me how the delivery was going but fell flat when my last message was that they had been left i still do not know if they have been recieved
neutral	ordered 0nd lot of cards which were printed to my specifications .
positive	they sent me out my little parcel to put in the phone ,
positive	thank_you all
neutral	overall i was pleased to have received my order promptly , but if i had taken time off work to receive the delivery it wouldn_'_t have worked smoothly at all .
negative	!
neutral	i was searching for accomodation for 0 - 0 feb , after finding what i thought was a good deal i booked .
neutral	hopefully see if jessops reads this to see if they contact me to arrange delivery of a new jigsaw tin ????
positive	wellworking answered my call on a sunday then called back as promised on monday .
neutral	we missed it completely , eventually realised we had gone too far and had to turn round and drive back .
positive	these_guys are great .
positive	on the occasions i have had to contact them they have always been receptive and resolved my issues .
negative	i immediately called the shop only to find they close at 0pm .
negative	it is also interesting that i got a response to a public post here rather_than my personal email .
neutral	after confirming my payment i realised the booking was for the next_day 0 / 0 even_though i had never changed any of my search dates .
positive	the online consultation was very quick and easy to use .
neutral	these_people had to re - enter the building , but were only told this after queueing for 00_minutes .
negative	open your eyes to a country that exploits us all through underhanded and abusive trading methods . loan sharks and criminals !
positive	always pleased with my cewe_photoworld books - ( i make these to show off my wedding work as we are a florist ), and we always get lots of positive_feedback from brides and prospective clients .
positive	i wanted a good quality trainer and looked at other named_brands but they didn_'_t match the quality of ecco
neutral	i '_m not a grinch where leaving reviews is concerned so i '_ll give credit where it '_s due .
positive	the delivery arrived on the day and the driver was very helpful and brought the worktops in for us .
neutral	their customer service is good .
neutral	i am really out of pocket due to the inflexibility of this old_fashioned insurance offered by trailfinders and it has quite put me off them .
positive	cheaper_than other mainstream cycling discount sites which is always a bonus !
positive	speedy delivery & great product
neutral	in fact the small packet of pills that i order comes in a box three_times larger which seems to justify the postal_costs ; and then it won_'_t go through the letterbox , causing inconvenience .
negative	i ordered from [_external_reference_] who were a third of the price and delivered on time .
positive	couldn_'_t be more pleased
positive	next_day delivery and great items at great prices !
negative	company failed to respond to e_mails requesting updates .
negative	had to contact them again on a few occasions only to be eventually told that the instructions were on line !!!
neutral	not fantastic .
negative	i have raised this issue with trading_standards as a false representation of a service . after spending_thousands with this company they seemed happy to lose a customer over ten_pounds in delivery costs .
positive	they were very pleased with their parcel , it arrived super quick and the outfits were brilliant .
negative	i had used mandmdirect a couple of times in the past but i happened to check my bank_account over christmas and they had taken money from my bank_account .
neutral	he was very rude to me on the phone and also to the recipient of my delivery .
negative	and most interesting is that there was no need to change sim_card i just needed to cut my old one in any mobile store for free .
neutral	!
negative	ridiculous
positive	bought amp last_year and guitar recently .
neutral	luckily i was at home , otherwise not sure what the delivery man would have done with 0 large boxes containg 00kg of dog_food and treats , which he had already brought to my door_step before ringing the door_bell !
neutral	tried various days and times of days to reach an advisor on the telephone without_success .
negative	this also proved the lie below stating that the " order had now been dispatched ", because i cancelled the order over the phone .
negative	interparcel have asked for all conceivable personal documentation which again was not explained as why they were required which left me feeling very uncomfortable .
positive	would recommend to any friends or family and will most definately use again to add to my dinner service .
positive	food / recipe suggestions , info on where the wines from and other wines to consider next
positive	there service is second to none with fantastic advice and of course the great surprises if you have a sweet_tooth :)
negative	where is my gift voucher ?
neutral	they arrived in two_separate boxes - one with the skis in and one with the board , but there was no protection other than the box itself .
neutral	the material was quite heavy and cutting a straight line wasn_'_t easy .
negative	so i took them off .
positive	simplelighting had well priced products but , not only that , we also wanted warm_white low_energy illumination and that is what they had to offer .
positive	second time i have used them and will_definitely be using them in future .
positive	i ordered two bottles of perfume .
negative	per farla breve : telefonate effettuate per avere una valutazione post preventivo , all ' incirca dieci .
neutral	staff on site were not very pleaseant to deal with and a bit rude .
positive	p . s .
positive	never had a negative_comment or bad_experience .
positive	easy to use web_sight
positive	good price .
negative	we have done nothing wrong other than the fact we have not succeeded in this venture , but if you wish to try and blacken our name in other ventures where we have different partners that have not been involved in house0market that is up to you and we can not stop you doing this .
negative	trying to resolve even simple matters by email is impossible as the staff are determined to misunderstand every communication and when calling the company i was cross examined about my personal_circumstances by a barely litterate undereducated rude adolescent .
positive	the tights were perfect for my halloween_party .
neutral	the thing is with virgin , if it is working it is great but prepare yourselves for when it isn_'_t .
positive	i bought a janome over locker from smd , for my wife '_s birthday , using paypal .
neutral	they are not exactly the cheapest chocolates in the world and to be given out of date chocolates is disgusting .
positive	we couldn_'_t complain with any of the staff and we had great customer service throughout .
positive	thanx simply_supplements .
positive	they are quick and easy to contact , more than happy to help with problems and they deliver extremely fast too .
negative	don_'_t go there !
neutral	not the best site ive looked at and not many promotions or loyalty schemes like skybet or betfair unfortunately
positive	delivered quickly and safely even_though i ordered them 0_days before christmas .
negative	they used to be great but i am deeply disappointed .
positive	but no - the beast has arrived , and it is exactly as i had remembered .
neutral	0 . the listed price on precisiontime was about 00_% lower_than nearest competition .
positive	brilliant savings , great food , what great end to a busy week .
negative	next_day . ehhhh . not if you have ordered on a friday
positive	this is one place we will be returning .
neutral	of course the problem was relatively trivial and obviously when first starting the car i must have inadvertantly depressed the clutch , not my usual practise .
neutral	the other is the courier service they use ( citylink ) are awful .
neutral	good communication , poor attention to detail , got them wrong twice , third time lucky ?
positive	wicken were the most competitively_priced in the market place .
neutral	change your delivery service from unhappy customer
negative	i was tempted by the lower advertised price of a camera lens .
positive	fantastic considering how much less i paid for them than on the high_street !
negative	no christmas spirit from them .
positive	i tried a friend '_s earlier version of printmusic , which was reasonably easy to operate with some guidance .
positive	walnut work top and up stands ordered at a very reasonable price .
positive	couldn_'_t do more to help me !
neutral	in brief , you order and then you wait . one week , two_weeks , three_weeks , four_weeks . and the goods might suddenly appear .
neutral	the staff in salzburg where very professional but i think a 00 hour brake down number would have been appropriate to have on my paperwork .
positive	superb service !
neutral	good service backed_up with a one to one telephone contact .
negative	i needed the camera delivered within 00 days so i could have it for my holiday i was going on .
positive	i would drfinitely use them again .
positive	this company left me with the impression that " nothing is too much_trouble for them ".
neutral	delivery instructions : - do not leave outside of property . i have never given this instruction - had i known - instruction would have been do not leave at no 00 !
positive	the product has_been on the market too long for it to be a ' fad ' product like so many others which is more for the producer '_s profit_margin than the pigeon '_s welfare .
neutral	good little first getaway with boyfriends / girlfriends , we managed well !
neutral	which has a value of £_00 .
positive	we were promised a text on the sunday morning to confirm our delivery window , which duly_arrived on time .
neutral	cons_: i have only made 0 orders so_far .
negative	the van broke_down - yeah_right .
neutral	product as decsribed but ordered on line as i didn_'_t have time to go to the shops .
negative	you can only follow the set questions which do not not cover the issue of my complaint .
negative	so in the unfortunate circumstance that the recipient will not get thier gift for christmas , i am advised that they can deliver it again at a date ' convenient ' for me in the new year , however there may be an additional_charge .
negative	here name is tilly and she still_hasn_'_t called .
positive	great service .
negative	bought an item from their hyde store online .
neutral	i then re - enter and it accepts .
negative	there cannot be a card put through my door because there is no letterbox .
neutral	wonderful idea to price match if possible depending on other purchases . ingenius !
positive	purchased under_armour cold gear , the price was nearly 00_%_cheaper_than anybody_else on the net and the goods were delivered within 0 days , would recommend .
positive	they were very quick response to email and telephoned me back to discuss what they could exchange for in my size .
neutral	tpms are becoming mandatory and event_tyres need to get up to date to handle them without giving the customer grief !
neutral	why not section the policy_document , and allow customers to print off only what pertains to their purchase ?
neutral	the face_cream offer was very good value however .
negative	in what should have been a calm conversation relating to a recent_purchase , the advisor begun to get exceedingly rude when asked a question she had no answer to .
negative	i asked if they could send the item that they sent originally and was told they could not do that !
neutral	so my only_criticism would be that is a palaver to return something and that does put me off ordering on line again .
negative	they do not listen , never admit fault and basically are becoming a complete monopoly .
negative	i went to the website to chase up the order and find out that they have ceased_trading .
negative	we do not !
positive	next more ng i get a conformation phone_call with an_apology that my original tyre wasn_'_t available , but a suitable replacement was made .
neutral	the option in previous years to exclude them from cover has_been removed .
positive	thank_you for an excellent service !
neutral	when i contacted them to point this out - there was just a standard response confirming that they had received my order .
negative	i ordered a bouquet for my friend for a very special_occasion , which should have been delivered yesterday 00 / 0 / 00 i provided correct details at time or ordering .
positive	so if i '_d ordered the 00 it would '_ve definitely been too small :-)
negative	i asked for a re delivery the following_day ( a saturday ) but received an email_saying we ' d have a fresh delivery on the monday .
negative	the hamper was only delivered on 00 december causing me much embarrassment as my sister had assumed i had forgotten her .
negative	i wanted a new amp for my birthday .
neutral	when they come out to repair a tyre they ask if you would like them to bring a new tyre in case a repair is not possible .
neutral	i have now given up and just trying to get a refund .
negative	he also just read t '_s and c '_s at me saying emails were no good and i had to phone them .
negative	awful experience .
negative	!
positive	one small reservation i have is that some times the vendors do not confirm the purchase ; especially when one has to clarify the placed order / s with the vendor / s .
neutral	at time of placing order added a message to seller to include on postage_label to say " if not in , then please leave with a neighbour ".
neutral	very pleased with how smooth the first half of the process was .
neutral	be aware that as well as posting second class , that they don_'_t class sat as a business day either .
negative	!
positive	i will put it up as soon as possible cos silly delivery man couldn_'_t find our house .
positive	however i received my last one with some damage during delivery ( citylink ) but thankfully it did not stop me from being_able to fit and use the blinds .
neutral	will i shop_here again ?
negative	and a quick message to mary , we have written on the facebook_page explaining the troublesome service we '_ve had , and your response was to delete it .
negative	very annoying !
negative	only requested an exchange for my sons hat which was faulty !
positive	our order arrived on time and was very competitive_pricewise .
negative	from iflorist , a wonderful deal !
negative	it had a further 0 tears and a crack .
neutral	i didn_'_t make an issue as the next_day the actual xbox_000 came along , but where was the other game ?. it didnt arrive until another 0_weeks had gone by , so in the end for everything to get to me , it took 00 days .
neutral	i then received an e_- mail some several days past the date that it was supposed to be delivered giving me another due date .
neutral	goods did arrive but i never did receive that second email as informed .
negative	really happy with my order , fast and at a very good price , i was really impressed till .
neutral	transfergo did good job but as i realized later tranferwise has better change rate from £ to euros and acctually i have lost 000 £ . if i would know before i wouldnt use transfergo !
neutral	even if your not going to use it and just want to cancel it so a seat is free for someone_else .
positive	ordered vertical_blinds for our_conservatory doors .
positive	one of the parts did not fit so spoke to maxine in customer service who said she would either get me a spare_part or deliver another stand the next_day .
negative	nowhere on this listing did they indicate this was a temporary lower price and the listing had 00 days left at the lower price .
positive	!
positive	quick delivery very well_packed excellent service will tell people about here and will certainly be back
neutral	that will help us to better estimate the fit online .
negative	no offer to chase royal_mail for me , no offer to reimburse postage for the inconvenience , no sympathy or concern .
negative	i do not believe the product you sent me is genuine rapidbrow , i have used to for over a year from boots with nothing but great results .
negative	the product must be of very poor quality to break after 0_days of normal use , unless the split was already there .
neutral	but the items were delivered on time after a problem with who pays customs at gatwick !
negative	this was insisted upon but i refused .
neutral	£_00 delivery charge for our order and they don_'_t even deliver to your flat .
negative	myself and the 0 friends for whom i purchased the tickets are all pensioners and can ill_afford such prices .
positive	will be back .
negative	purchased a jacket in december from this website , a day or two later they email me and tell me i will not be receiving it as it is out of stock .
positive	used them for the first time at the end of march and have made another 0 orders since then .
negative	well they have gone up a lot at aldi and far more than the others .
negative	00_mins from newbury .
negative	i emailed asking if it could be delivered a particular day .
negative	mail to their suite 00 , liberty way , sunderland address was returned as " unknown " and we '_ve had no response to mail sent to their registered address .
positive	simple_lighting were very helpful .
neutral	on the monday , i used the contact form on the website to explain the problem .
negative	i asked if their delivery fee would be waived considering the circumstances , i am yet to receive a reply .
positive	the mower was received the day after i ordered it as promised so no_complaints !
positive	i received personal courteous service from smd and the machine plus loads of extra_goodies arrived by courier the next_day .
positive	have used the soup_maker for the first time today and was very impressed with it .
negative	i made a call last_week to be told , yes , the goods had been received back and that i would receive my refund in due course !!
negative	the cable from my village to the exchange ( 0 miles ) is decaying .
neutral	i was left with a mountain of packing_material .
positive	need i say more ?
neutral	modtog bekræftelse på bestilling , og skrev til firmaet , at jeg gerne ville have dem hurtigst muligt .
negative	there has still been no acknowledgement as of 00th_may 00 .
neutral	they are expensive but i like their designs albeit finishing on some furniture has_been disapointing .
negative	nobody got in touch to say that it would be delayed .
negative	really dissapointed and feel misled as to the quality of the product , will be returning the item asap .
positive	wish more companies were like them !
positive	i was really impressed with the variety of mains , soups , snacks and accompaniments of rice & cereals included in the promotional package i ordered .
neutral	after much frustration i '_m finally sitting here with the angry_birds game i ordered as a present almost a month_ago just in time for christmas .
neutral	time from point of despatch to delivery .
negative	after ordering a bedroom_furniture set in aug and was pleased with decided to order another one for different room in oct arrived 0th_nov some of which was damaged , told rang customer_services told to refuse delivery of those items and replacements would be sent out y end of week which we did . of course replacements were not coming anytime_soon , after numerous_calls to the call_centre and apart_from been told different things about a resolution to our problem which we had to restart the story each time we rang , it was all so robotic word for word even down the very insincere apology for the problem . anyway after all the calls and a letter that was advised by trading_standards giving a deadline saying what we wanted to happen by ( which they responded to the day before that date with no resolution ) help from credit_card provider and 0months later after a lot of stress we decided to demand a refund which also took days to sort_out properly despite reassurances it would happen . i would never recommend a large purchase from asda direct that comes from a supplier . they clearly don_'_t care about their customers and definitely need to look very hard at their customer_services which is out of uk with no empathy or real knowledge of what they are doing there '_s no way contacting anyone in a higher position , you just can '_t past their 0000 number i know i tried . the whole_process is an_absolute_joke .
neutral	after 0pm i rang the courier .
neutral	thank_you .
negative	they then changed my flights back but to a different airport , it was only when i googled the directors details and asked to speak to him the sorted the flights out
positive	great item , fast delivery with lots of email_updates . will use company again . well_done them !
negative	i told them that they should have records of my calls , and should know exactly_what had happened , and that i was with my friends at the time , and telling them all never to take out a contract with three .
neutral	imagine my surprise when the ticket machine showed that i had to pay an extra £_00 instead .
positive	thankyou guys :)
negative	the next thing i noticed was how dirty it was , it was covered with a thick layer of dust and i had to wash it .
positive	i was kept up to date on my order and emailed details all the way .
positive	returns and exchanges are free and prompt and telephone_conversations are calm and helpful .
negative	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?.
neutral	needless to say , i was very disappointed with this .
positive	excellent !
neutral	was told there was a problem with the supplier .
positive	you can pick a delivery date which suits you so thumbs_up all_round .
neutral	and " your delivery '_s going to be at this time in the morning ", so i was sat there ready in wait , but this driver decided it wasn_'_t worth their time either .
negative	all they care about is getting as much money off you as possible and not caring about anything_else - beware !
negative	was offered a refund which doesnt really help
negative	they didn_'_t even consider my troubles and now i have been left with a dud machine that cost £_000 !!!
neutral	argos can be a bit hit and miss .
neutral	when we collected the car his parting comment was we were driving out ' on the road to hell .'
neutral	after manually setting_up payment over the phone , everything_went through and goods delivered next_day .
positive	would def use again
negative	received a third call from the debt_collectors this morning 00nd_january_0000 - when we moved out november 0rd 0000 .
positive	great service , quick and efficient .
neutral	not happy !
positive	love our badges superb job , we are a new business , they were easy to design would recommend this site to anyone and everyone ,
neutral	had my mother waiting till half 0 at night for these
positive	what you pay for is the item , plus the profit which goes to the seller .
neutral	i ordered a pharmaceutical product on saturday or sunday , don_'_t remember what day , and expected it monday or tuesday at the latest .
negative	so , of course i e_- mailed amazon customer_services pointing_out that they have allowed a vendor onto marketplace which sold me a dodgy product with no warranty and has subsequently disappeared .
positive	i recently_purchased two pine single_beds from firstfurniture and found the service fantastic , the delivery was swift and as stated , the beds were very easy to put_together and excellent quality . i found the beds were the cheapest on ebay and i would highly_recommend this company for any of your furniture needs ,
neutral	the prices are cheaper and service is better .
neutral	regards
neutral	i chased to be told they were looking into it .
positive	i '_ve ordered a few_times from battery_force and the products have always been dispatched promptly , would not_hesitate recommending this site to anyone !
positive	i can '_t fault this company at all and would recommend to anyone .
neutral	i use simply_supplements because i find their prices for the specific items we use are cheaper_than other_suppliers .
neutral	makes no sense .
negative	he said he would take it to the shop and sort it and that this would make the gap less .
positive	00 am etc .
negative	i had to make a phone_call asking just when my order will be arriving as my son has taken time off work to do the decorating .
positive	i overcame all my problems in this regards easily by slight adjustments of camera angles .
negative	one representative told me that delivery takes between 0 - 0 working_days , another told me it is next_day delivery and sim should be with me shourtly .
neutral	website is easy to use , however i feel the delivery was expensive and the parcel took a while to be delivered .
neutral	still having said that , the company and my experience ( forgetting the price for a moment ) of the company is favourable .
positive	i tried to order from another place but my order was cancelled , so i tried here , my order was processed quickly and it was delivered the day and time i wanted .
positive	many_thanks
negative	managed to get a delivery ref for citylink , citylink informed me that the package was missing and simply_electronics knew this and should send another phone and claim on insurance .
positive	i thought it was a chip that could have been repaired drive to autoglass to be told that this was not possible and needed new screen .
negative	phoned customer_services who simply said they will deliver tommorow !
negative	apparently they are based in hong_kong !!!!
negative	this was the feature that i thought dpd had over the rival courier companies .
negative	the cash claim site is terrible and does not allow me to make the claim i need to .
neutral	very easy to use and straight_forward to use with the latest deal going on .
negative	interparcel were helpful in resolving the issue but i think they should question whether they should be signposting customers to such a rubbish service .
negative	i organised someone to wait in all day on friday but no one came .
negative	rude , useless , and still_awaiting the refund

negative	having already purchased an expensive panasonic tm000 camcorder from simplyelectrical in sept_0000 - and that was despite bad comment found here !
positive	started ordering from muscle_food after being told about it by friends and now use it every week for all our chicken_breasts and egg_whites , freshly delivered meat and brilliant quality

positive	would definately recommend
neutral	construction took me 00mins and was quite fiddly as there was a lot to build but the result is a strong good looking bike that doesn_'_t take up too much room .
neutral	ten days_later and i '_m still_waiting did phone after one week only to be told that there was a delay on the cuff_links .
neutral	high prices , good quality gear .
positive	loving it , thanks chris .
neutral	i would ask any company not to use these_guys .
positive	transaction was completed in a professional and satisfactory manner
neutral	bought myself an xbox_000 with 0 games as a bundle pack , thought i would treat_myself .
negative	0 days_later got a phone_call to say the store had been broken into and they had taken my item . strange that the thieves went for my £_00 item when the store was selling £_000 items and these are still being advertised on their website so obviously the thieves did not bother with them ( perhaps they only like cheap items ??)
neutral	the service very good , updates on delivery , would have preferred more buds on the flowers , rather_than open , as would last longer .
neutral	like the concept but the whole point of musclefood is the convenience .
neutral	however , although my wife_loved the flowers she did say the roses , included in the display , looked a little_tired when delivered .
negative	my prescription was unclear and i asked " does the line above the cyl number mean the number is negative ?"
negative	not to mention disappointed kids at christmas .
neutral	later i discovered a typing mistake and wanted to email ebookers .
positive	really pleased - from finding the right size , ordering and even fitting was all easy to do / find on the website .
neutral	again very nice guys .
negative	i had a problem trying to get anyone at the company to reply to my phone_calls and emails as i needed them urgently for a works meeting .
positive	i really liked their web_site where you can see your sign develop with the design , font & lettering colours plus the holes options .
negative	i am moving_house , can not move until i have a sofa and white goods , argos are holding my money .
neutral	no intimation on website item was out of stock .
neutral	what '_s worst is i have tried to change my address so it can be delivered to my work place and it says can not be done .
positive	high_standard
positive	as above 0_star treatment i would recommend this company
negative	they should stick to making volkswagens . lol
neutral	cant say to much about animed_direct at the moment as only just gone with them , however must_admit there delivery was very quick & the price for the tablets was quite good .
negative	this site started off with very well meaning intentions but as time has_gone i feel this site is of little value now .
positive	special consideration should be given to the fitter for his great customer service .
neutral	two items are on late delivery which was not advised on the website at the time of order back in early october .
negative	they directed me to you .
positive	very pleased with the speed of delivery but disappointed that the delivery driver just left the heavy box in the porch for my wife to lift inside .
neutral	the service was very very good but to repeat once more too over the top so only 0 / 00 which was a shame .
negative	i did buy some products for businss purpose , and no complain if they closed my account , the problem is they never return the money to me , i called them many_times , every time they said account specialist ( they called themselves specialist , funny ) will contact me in 00_hours , but i never got reply on time .
negative	i would recommend sticking to your local_florist
neutral	i got a book done by blurb last_year and for around half the price the quality of the photos was much_nicer and more natural looking - although even these were less good than when printed on a photo printer .
neutral	i did not check the paperwork so i accept some responsibility .
positive	i recently went_onto savewatersavemoney to get some tips as i had received an_email from them .
neutral	bar_crawl that was apparently a party pass was not even heard of in any of the bars on the list so a waste of time .
neutral	with the flowers i requested that a message be included .
positive	that is what i would call wonderful service !
positive	highly_reccommended .
negative	!
neutral	i also found the overly matey attitude they assume very grating .
negative	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
neutral	i am therefore disappointed with this aspect and would have been prepared to pay a few extra pounds to have decent quality pull chords .
negative	" enormously disappointing .
negative	unfortunately it did not work .
negative	i am soooooooo angry and frustrated with this entire situation and that it is still not resolved .
positive	the best we have experienced to date
neutral	well_packed though . but the so thin paper has_been ruined as soon as i touched it , by creasing .
positive	.
neutral	we have booked for next march - thbooking experience was fine but i did then mail to add bed_linen and towels to our order but hvehad no response .
positive	no sales_pitch , no security questions , just straight_forward service .
negative	running out of stock with what i have , my diet messed_up etc . surely a supplement supplier should understand what this means to a sports fanatic and personal_trainer no ?
neutral	- it would have been nice to have been immediately notified item / s were out of stock ( website / phone / email . anything ), instead of being left in the dark and having to chase them .
negative	i am so disappointed and upset .
negative	thankfully i also took pictures of the box before sending so i can prove the size and weight , lets_see if interparcel or ups can ?
negative	after watching 00mins shopping video .
negative	one week on , the problem has not been solved .
negative	i '_ve reported them to trading_standards , as they are obviously a bunch of cowboys .
positive	found them to be areputable company , have bought several items over the past few_years and have never been disappointed .
negative	firstly i found the website difficult to understand .
neutral	annoyingly they didn_'_t have quite the right size that i was looking for - they ' re a little too_big and i also don_'_t think it was made obvious that sticky_labels were sold separately - that would have been helpful to know , but i '_ll make do i suppose .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	the most_recent item i have purchased , a side table , i asked if it could be delivered to the fulham road store .
positive	i was kept well informed .
neutral	so , unless you get a very helpful member of staff who can find a way round that , you have to go home , log on , and re - order on line .
negative	lesson_learnt .
negative	the way i am being treated by tyreleader is a disgrace !
positive	the products were excellent and value for money
positive	perfectly packed , well butchered and delivered exactly when promised .
positive	i ordered an indesit built in oven at 0000 on 00 / 00 /_0000 . it was delivered and installed by 0000 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 . unpbeatable service . it definately four yeses from me !!
negative	hope to hear from you .
neutral	i did eventually get my game but had to go through extensive verification that is way too much than necessary , i can see why you have so much verification but this needs to be toned down significantly as it makes the checking out process very complicated and lengthy .
negative	company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery .
negative	especially when i told them it was urgent , and it '_s not ok that when it '_s their fault they didn_'_t do everything in their power to try and fix it .
neutral	we were told to pick_up the car from terminal 0 .
positive	highly_recommended delivery very speedy and kept_informed every_step of the way 00 out of 00
neutral	they ' re ok , but i enquired_about ' anytime upgrade ' and was sent an_email_saying i was able to have it , but ring the phoneline to sort . rang phone line . they said i wasn_'_t entitled . someone , somewhere isn_'_t very familiar with their products and services !
negative	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
neutral	my only issue was that i paid £_00 too much for the makita_impact_driver .
negative	they gave_us that assurance .
neutral	all the goods were packed extremely professionally , but was disappointed that there wasnt a little sample inside as was indicated on the purchase page .
neutral	spa day sounded great so we booked it , it was in a grubby hotel that wasn_'_t a spa it had tiny changing rooms which were dirty and smelly , pool was old and run down , jacuzzi was small and old , not big enough to hold a hen_party as only 0 broken un loungers !!!
positive	the service is fast and reliable .
negative	around 00_hours went past before i contacted them , having not received a reply .
negative	many_thanks i just lost 00 £
neutral	i haven_'_t seen the shoes yet .
neutral	even_though the flowers were very nice , the order was fulfilled .
positive	was kept_informed re dispatch and delivery .
neutral	my purchases have gone without_any real incident but i do have a complaint when asking for information .
neutral	i ordered a calendar , some prints , and a small photobook , all at the same time because i thought i could reduce the postage_costs that way ( my mistake - although actually jessops ' mistake ).
negative	the quality of the materials they use is rather . questionable .
negative	paypal are one of those companies i dread having to contact .
positive	anyway went online , registered my used iphone one evening within 0_days i got the envelope .
negative	firstly please_accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of aspect . co . uk that your experience was anything other than the highest_level of service we aim to deliver .
neutral	but , price was good ; service was good , arrived on time .
negative	wont_be doing it again .
neutral	i then tried collect_+ plus with better luck , and went with them .
positive	helpful staff .
negative	my package did not come until the saturday when i wasent home and then royal_mail said i had to wait - so therefor i didnt get to dress up for my halloween parties .
neutral	i ordered the photobook from jessops because they were recommended as being the best quality books , so i hope that once i do eventually receive the order it will be worth the wait .
positive	the sunglasses i bought were a bit on the loose side .
negative	i will never , ever , ever knowingly use a company that has ups as its delivery company .
negative	i would stay well away from pet_supermarket , they are cheap for a reason and probably subsidise their business by using an expensive customer service telephone_number .
positive	have been dealing_with the company for a long time the delivery service is very good and will make contact with customer if product is not available and i have always been very satisfied with alternative advice and product replacement
neutral	now the pc is working fine and my son is really pleased with it .
positive	to top it all , the price i paid was quite a saving to the prices i had been quoted from other local_garages .
positive	my back was really playing up lately , i wasnt sleeping soundly at all , then i ripped a muscle in my shoulder & sleep was no more !
negative	someone in viagogo who clearly doesnt know how to do their job properly processes this incorrectly and 0 . 0_months later i am still_waiting for my money .
positive	i cannot_praise enough the quality of service and professionalism i have experienced for the order i have placed .
neutral	we choose not to be on the electoral roll as it lessens the potential junk_mail we receive and cuts down the possibility of being a victim of a scam and / or have our identities stolen . if you believe the same . think_twice before you use europcar / alamo to hire your next car no matter_how many_times you have used them in the past . because their computer is likely to ' say no ' - not a good start to a holiday when you need to get to the airport in a hurry !
positive	delighted .
positive	this was a brilliant and cost - effective_solution to our problem .
negative	again , ratings are largely meaningless .
negative	after further_discussion he said they would refund a mileage amount and when i asked about the time and disruption he said the store was authorised to give further compensation which could be negotiated and the store would have details of the complaint .
negative	a judgement was made against them by the judge for the full_amount and now after the period for reasonable payment expires tomorrow i am forced to go and get the judgement enforced and the courts will recover the money on my behalf from them .
neutral	one is tescos wine which never ever automatically shows up , drives me mad .
neutral	!
positive	phoned viovet and arranged for it to be returned and replaced with next size up .
positive	both arrived exactly on time .
neutral	binder slightly faulty but still acceptible .
positive	collection from your door saves time and hassle .
neutral	i have received exceptional service in the past and so can only believe that this was an unfortunate blip .
positive	next_day delivery - i opted for first_class .
neutral	apart_from that it was very easy to set_up and pay for the service .
negative	!.
neutral	however , goods inside the delivery box were all intact and fine .
positive	bruce ernest
positive	purchased new wheel_trims from them and within a few_days they had been delivered .
neutral	do not know where the fault lies , but , suggest look0parking , and the car parking people communicate with each other more closely
neutral	it is true that i made no complaint to customer_services .
negative	" could you please advise when this order will be dispatched ."
neutral	later on , i ordered separate prints and thank - you cards ; they were of " regular " quality and the difference was obvious .
negative	app deleted .
negative	like the plague .
negative	all i got was emails saying a few more days , another few_days .
negative	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
neutral	for my initial wellies order ( as advertised on their website ) they were out of stock - quite frustrating .
neutral	i then never_heard a thing so i phoned on 00 / 00 / 00 and was told marc was on holiday that day and furthermore they rarely checked emails , which surprised me as it was marc that emailed me looking for a reply .
positive	thank_you for jobs well_done !!!
positive	and the end_result was two very nice pieces of furniture .
negative	i was offered a screen_protector and upgraded delivery ( laughable if not infuriating ).
neutral	they eventually arrived the day after so 0 days late .
positive	are you sitting comfortably ?
positive	john gildert
negative	telephone_calls not returned when promised either .
negative	shocking .
neutral	i was really pleased with the item and price that you offered , delivery was made within 0_days but i paid about 0 . 00 for post and packaging which i felt was too much .
neutral	since updating adam davis has called me - he assures_me that he takes very seriously any negative_reviews and says he will take steps to ensure that the problems i had do not happen again .
negative	flowers were for a friend who '_s been amazing so feel let_down at lack of flowers .
negative	now they are lying and patronising me !
neutral	it would have been better if the squares could have been arranged differently for different solutions .
negative	i tried the wednesday meal and was too scare to try anymore .
neutral	after losing a significant_amount of weight , nearly 0 stone i decided to celebrate by buying a superdry t - shirt as many of my friends wear them and i wanted to join the gang so to speak .
negative	so , i contact office ( who i ordered from ) they eventually ( 0 working_days_later ) let_me know that theyve asked the courier to redeliver , though with no eta
neutral	will look at other options in future .
negative	unsurprisingly , the phone did not miraculously work as a result of their ' testing '.
neutral	further to this the automated overall rating on reviews is absolutely_ridiculous as are the rating criteria .
neutral	i have ordered two beds and a number of chests of drawers from oakfurnitureland .
neutral	this could only have been done by the fitter or by my mechanic .
negative	an email to customer_care yesterday lunchtime has_gone_unanswered .
negative	they made us get our own keys_cut from the one set they had ( even_though they should of had 0 ) and even had the cheek to ask us for them back at the end of our tenancy .
neutral	the web_site was a bit_iffy as the search_function did not seem to recognize the specific poles i was looking for and i had to trawl the site to find them - twice .
negative	she rang the following_morning and was advised that 0 other mattresses had been mislaid but they would get back to her .
neutral	the bundle of lights arrived after about a week , not the fastest post .
neutral	finally i spoke to someone in salzburg .
negative	i also told them i would post this experience on every social_media and reviews site that i could find , hence this review .
negative	this company have absolutly no after sales support . i purchased helium_balloons and a helium cylinder and it was the biggest mistake i made in years . after just half an_hour the balloons started to drop and within an_hour they were all on the floor . i called partyrama and asked for help and advice to be told there was nothing they could do as they did not do a same day delivery and that i was to blame even if they could deliver i would have to pay for a new cylinder because i should of inflated the balloons at the party not at home hours before . just as well i did do them at home can you imagin the embarrasment of helium_balloons on the floor at the party . i suggest you stay clear of this company . i will never use them ever again .
neutral	all in all i would use eflorist again - but have a closer look at the type of packaging involved first !
negative	it arrived on time but was faulty .
positive	i was amazed to find they had been delivered and put_together when i got home from work the following_day .
negative	i '_ve left messages with people requesting call back from their ' accounts ' department on several_occasions but have heard_nothing .
negative	i arrived to pick the car up at about 0 :_00pm .
positive	the way i was kept in touch with each_stage of the process was very reassuring eg .
positive	your representative at the paphos_office in cyprus fiona parsley was first_class
negative	their " order and collect next_day in store " option is a lie .
negative	however today they did not turn_up , no calling_card , nothing .
negative	they were incredibly ugly and represented poor value for money .
neutral	i know this is clearly_stated in the delivery information but with some highstreet opticians able to complete orders in under an_hour i expect a faster turnaround .
negative	these are not worth the money .
negative	all very well giving a call limit but they let you go over without notification .
neutral	when i received the delivery notification it stated the flowers had been left in a secure_location - this was incorrect , the had been left on an unmanned desk in the building lobby ( they are for my wife as a thank_you as she '_s looking after me as i have two broken legs and can '_t get about ), she works at a business that shares a building with a number of others .
negative	dont get you item , dont answer the phone , and dont answer your emails , and you dont get your money back
negative	sadly this is not the case .
positive	found this website via_google , it was quick and easy to use .
positive	!
positive	they just got the job_done and were gone .
neutral	adds even more so when rentalcars quote you bear in mind it will cost more
neutral	i ordered a beautiful bunch of flowers for my best friends birthday and paid_extra for them to be bigger .
neutral	so all '_s well now and iv ' e got the email i wanted and the back of my hand too .
negative	low and behold on day 0 the review i took 00_mins to compose and type was gone .
negative	very nice website , with easy ordering .
positive	superb service , what else can you say !
positive	i do use other services from time to time for certain shipments but much prefer the interpacel website as i find it one on the easiest to use and label generation / printing is generally superior to other_sites .
positive	we sprayed it in the bedroom and around the doors .
positive	very pleased with the whole shopping_experience .
neutral	purchased an hp officejet pro 0000a plus e_- all - in - one wireless multifunction inkjet_printer from this company , the item was delivered within the time_scale promised but unfortunately they failed to inform_me either by sms or text when this was .
positive	reasonable_prices and choice of delivery makes the process a pleasing experience .
neutral	i may stick to physically choosing flowers from a store , so i know what i get for my money .
neutral	0 .
negative	she eventually found this out after repeated e_mails to the company for this information and several standard replies which clearly indicates that her e_mails were not even read properly .
negative	my previous multiple emails , telephone inquiries and even live - chats have been completely_ignored , now i am assured that my goods have been dispatched ( to a " blank " post_code ) so only time will tell if the goods will turn_up .
negative	so i switched only last_week because i can '_t take this with scottish_power anymore . this morning had a phone_call from sp on a sunday morning from a witheld number . bearing in mind scottsh power are not open on a sunday said he was clearing the £_00 debt and he can see there was always a problem with the meter_reading . that i shouldn_'_t have been in debt because i '_m pay as you go .
positive	well_worth sticking them into your favourites_list and having an occasional view even if you not really shopping for anything in particular .
positive	time with alpha_rooms will use again !
neutral	a mixed_bag of experience .
positive	as a personal_trainer i have used other_companies before and can_honestly_say that tpw is the nest company that i have used so_far .
neutral	misinformation was given regarding motifs , the print colour of our order of service ’_s was wrong and then finally we received an a0 table plan when an a0 was ordered .
negative	instead there were 0 stems of blue aster and 0 stems of non specific purple flowers .
negative	i contacted the company by email and victoria ( costumer service ) replied to me saying to return the item via a recorded delivery ( it was recommended in case the item got lost ) and also to forward a copy of the recorded tracking_number to them via_email .
neutral	the lenses had differing positions through which to look for either eye to be in focus .
positive	the fact that we have bought several cars from dealership should say it all .
neutral	for an expensive product ( over £_000 ) the packaging ( just a plastic_bag ) was not really sufficient , but it arrived_safely .
neutral	but all in all was satisfied with purchase but would have struggled if there had been a problem .
positive	thanks
neutral	very helpful lady sorted this out .
positive	will gladly use them again .
positive	a refreshing_change compared with some companies .
positive	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch_time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
negative	what ?!
neutral	( i would have to wait in again ) basically the parcel was collected two_days_later than it should have been .
negative	i managed to get one item .
neutral	it took about 00_minutes to sort this out and we had to return to the french side to eventually pick_up the car .
negative	very conveniently they have no record of my complaint back in february .
positive	i love activebeauty .
positive	posted one afternoon , money in my account the next_day , paid the quoted amount .
positive	a friend recommended simply_supplements as i wanted to start my dog on glucosamine .
positive	printed - off free_postage_label popped nokia into envelope ( remembering to take out simm and extra memory_chip !)
positive	very easy to navigate web_pages .
positive	having never brought medication on line for my pets before , i was given the animed_direct information by the vets receptionist and then once i had got the prescription from my vet , i found it easy to e_- mail over and then buy the flea_treatment a great deal cheaper .
neutral	i have sent two emails and heard_nothing back .
positive	the only issue i had was it took a little_longer_than_expected to receive the cheque .
neutral	it is good to know that if there is an issue with an order , takeaway . com have processes in place that have the potential to help .
neutral	hence i have ended_up paying for both lots of cards .
neutral	i was disappointed and a little annoyed but i found some one that charged me £_00 less_than ao . com if they had of fitted it for me .
negative	i was assured that it was and to my surprise on the next_day when the order went through we were disconnected from the broadband .
positive	i would recommend the company to family and friends who are looking for partywear .
positive	i have been looking for a textile jacket for the warmer months , and didn_'_t really know which to get .
neutral	they have good prices .
neutral	i will return the rest of the box , and look_elsewhere for a replacement
positive	well_done .
neutral	i understand that it says on your website terms that a substitute would be provided , but as a customer you expect to get what you pay for and therefore would have been better if you had advised me that the item was different to what i expected to be sent so that i could have cancelled my order .
neutral	in my particular case i had an_emergency and really needed funds badly .
neutral	they look nice and the materials seem pretty good quality , but comfort is definitely lacking .
negative	eventually they arranged a delivery date for early april ( yes that long ) and i arranged a day off work to receive the bed .
neutral	booked a next_day pick_up with citi link - item was collected on a thursday ( citi link say it was friday but it was my sister who handed the parcel to the driver ) & item was then delivered on the monday .
negative	to say that i am disappointed would be a great understatement .
positive	excellent experience from this company , dispatched quickly , details of freight carrier given , arrived within time_scale and was well_packaged .
positive	fantastic service provided by initial salesperson to customer service after purchase . fab piece of furniture which looks gorgeous in our room at a super discounted_price too !!
negative	my advice is if your making a large purchase , don_'_t do it from here .
neutral	i like the concept and the website is relatively easy to use .
neutral	i was told by the girl on the phone that the post_office would not accept a package over a certain weight which i thought strange as i get items shipped from the u . s all the time by post .
neutral	mike crook . 0000 000 0000 or 00000_000000 . any day , anytime after 00 . 00 am please .
positive	very pleased with my first purchase , the best price including_postage .
negative	i recived an email eventually from some girl called karleen same as others . seems like they only have one customer service rep .
negative	after a twenty minute phone_call ( at expensive rates between mozambique and amsterdam ) klm had the problem sorted .
neutral	the reply stated that the parcel was with the couriers - this is a whole seven_days after i ' d received the dispatch_notification , but it did apologise for delivery taking longer_than usual .
negative	three is the worse mobile network in the uk
positive	happy customer !
neutral	i received a phone_call from customer_relations ( cr ) about an_hour after i had posted my review on trust_pilot .
negative	groupon could not help with this either so we had to find an_alternative which cost us lots more than our original trip .
positive	i often send drinks as birthday_presents and the drink_shop is always where i go .
neutral	i ordered my sunglasses using a groupon_voucher .
positive	had a few questions which was easily answers over there live_chat system .
positive	easy order , quick delivery , easy online registration .
negative	they said screen was scratched and revised to 00_% original quote
negative	this time i received damaged goods and part missing , four_weeks_later still no parts received . not good
positive	0st_class .
positive	then next_day we got a good transfer back to the boat and a cracking sail home !!!
neutral	please bring back the old downloadable_software .
negative	i only hope the alternative tyres will arrive or that there will be no problem with a refund !!!
neutral	and made it sound that we were privileged to be offered a ' free upgrade ' - we hate large vehicles both to drive ( as it feels_like you are driving a bus ) and from an ecological point of view .
neutral	once again for the amount this cost i am really unhappy about it .
neutral	done my best .
positive	the only down sides are small feeding tube means that the fruit and veg has to be cut up into small pieces and the juicer is slow , but this is why the end product is so good and for me this is a small price to pay , for high_quality juice .
negative	they said on their website it was worth £_00 !
neutral	six pounds !
positive	really good woulg use again
positive	thanks
positive	the drill itself has plenty of oomph for those tough jobs , though maybe a little on the heavy side .

positive	e_- bookers will get my business every time !
negative	!
neutral	:(
negative	:-(
positive	the response was a curteous reply & the medication for our elderly labrador was delivered within a few_days .
negative	i contacted first_utility on the 0th_january as they had increased my direct_debit without_any notification , which made me incur bank charges of £_00 for going overdrawn .
neutral	arrived at the centre and as if by incompetant magic , they said they didn_'_t have an appointment for me .
neutral	also bad if you have to return damaged goods , its at your own_expense and in most_cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage_charges of recorded delivery so the item is traceable in the mail .
neutral	' i know about the sale of goods_act ' was her response , which was nice , but tht ' a s a different piece of legislation to the distance_selling_regulations 0000 and the oft document is open to interpretation whereas the legislation is clear on leaving the customer out of pocket for returns under the0 day period of the distance sellings regs !
negative	!
negative	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
neutral	great price , but . they took about 0_weeks to come , and then they werent the right fitting .
neutral	initially loved moonpig , but now find the cards are much the same , with the personalisation very predictable .
negative	automatic_renewal is magically turned on without notification , even when you were using one of their many acquisitions that had no such feature .
neutral	i was pleased to find the item i hadn_'_t been able to find elsewhere and contact from seller was good initially .
negative	she gave_me a tracking_number reluctantly and the tracking_number does not work !
neutral	i took the blind down and it looked like it hadn_'_t been fitted properly .

positive	it was the best price i could find at £_00 . 00 and arrived in four days .
positive	i contacted all my local locksmiths from nottingham , leicester and derby no one could supply me with extra spare_keys for my new uvpc door , yale wanted £_00 + 0_weeks waiting , found lock and key on the web very helpful two keys for under_£_00 and delivered to a friends address for security within 00_hours that is what i call service
negative	these flowers obviously had not been prepared by a local_florist and had also appeared to have been stored somewhere hot .

positive	cheapest one i have found , ideal for summer hols .
negative	at 00 : 00 i received an_email from eflorist , saying they would not be able to deliver at all that day !!
negative	they would call me back with an update
negative	no contact phone number on webisite .
negative	item ordered , money taken , item not received .
negative	i received a response to this . asking me to submit a claim for compensation !
neutral	an email_explaining the situation would have been helpful .
neutral	great product , great website , " so - so " ordering experience , disappointing delivery options .
positive	i haven_'_t had any_problems with the company other than when trying to renew my insurance , but i just rang up and they got it sorted straight_away would definitely recommend
negative	i couldn_'_t be_bothered to complain , having worked a mean shift earlier and not in the mood for confrontation .
neutral	i would like a refund as i have had to buy more from a local_store ( costing double the price ) .
neutral	the most frustrating part was that all 0 of these photos had been submitted and refused on separate_occasions .

positive	will definitely keep in mind for future !
positive	i ordered a rat trap on a sunday via the internet .

negative	i had prior to this attempted to contact mr stewart newman again to discover i was unable to reach him because he was on holiday !!
neutral	easy to use website , good selection of stock .
neutral	then it took them several days to get back to me with a revised_offer .
positive	and when it arrived the next_day it was brilliantly_packaged to save any damage .
positive	ordered 0 powder extinguishers from fire_protection , price was very good & they are good quality ones .
positive	i would use this company again .
neutral	this year , owing to the death of my mother , and so not wanting so many plants we cut down our order .
negative	contacted a call_centre on the 0000 no .
positive	despite the fact that it wasn_'_t their fault that i hadn_'_t received the order , they were happy to send out a repeat order without_any fuss and were extremely_helpful .
negative	i then encountered even more poorly_designed logistical processes for the end user which resulted_in then another employee to suggest that i was " not co - operating " at the same time .
positive	once i had made my payment via_paypal and entered my mobile details i immediately received a confirmation code by text , which when entered on the site link in my confirmation_email gave_me my xbox_live voucher_code .
neutral	logged a claim months_ago about a payment that had been withdrawn .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before ordering anything from them .
positive	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .

positive	returned a group set once and was refunded without an issue .
neutral	well i really enjoyed the ship , the experience was spot_on .
positive	very pleased with our purchases .
positive	customer service were incredibly helpful and had good knowledge of products .
negative	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
negative	there are lots of ecommerce stores that actually care about their customers , so use them instead
negative	might be alright to all you geeks , but to me at 00 its all gobbledegook , it is so complicated , to make a complaint about something they havnt done , as in miss bugs , first of all you have to run a scan of some kind then download it to their site , then wait for a sarcastic reply , and after all that , absolutely nothing .
negative	what a terrible firm , because of their past name i ordered lots from them at the start of the growing season , the seeds arrived , but the seed_potatoes sets , and grow bags i ordered hadn_'_t .
negative	the store manager came out and noted concerns and agreed it was under foamed .
neutral	all in all satisfactory but i would say - don_'_t make promises that you don_'_t then meet .
neutral	perhaps it was a one off so may try again .
positive	as the watch was currently not located at that branch , i asked a couple of questions online first to which kieran was able to answer and also send me over additional pictures of the watch ( omega_seamaster 000m ).
negative	took pc back to ccl on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	says it all really .
neutral	nice site easy to navigate
negative	they cancel on you long after you booked it and you ' re left with no place to stay without paying a much higher price .
positive	if you are get there on time , you win the prize , which is affordable transport , ahead of the rest .
negative	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
neutral	we all love the sparkles they jog our memories of our past and of happy times
positive	would definetly deal with this company again .
negative	photographs were taken on this trip , and i will have the camera out in september .
negative	00_% of the programs broadcast by itv are complete rubbish .
positive	always use these_guys . just fantastic
neutral	ordered on line and it asked for a specific time when i would collect it .
neutral	we received a phonecall to say we could have our furniture delivered on the 0th , so arranged for my dad to be at our house .
neutral	it was really embarrassing because it was a gift for a lady_who was retiring .
negative	eventually i threatened to start up a facebook_page with a less_than complementary title , within 0 / 0 an_hour i was offered a " complimentary " delivery of flowers , which i accepted .
positive	it takes much of the stress out of arriving and leaving an airport .
neutral	amazingly however they do not know what kind of screws they use in their glasses so asked me to " send them a photo ."
neutral	we were advised that they would be delivered the next_day , thought wow great !!
positive	ideal .
positive	brilliant .
neutral	i can '_t comment on how good this insurer is if in need of a claim but it was straight_forward to get cover for my mobile phone .

neutral	postage_charges especially to ireland are very high .
positive	top_class to deal with fast orders no_messing .
negative	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
neutral	a bit more care with packages and this company would stand_out way above the rest
neutral	at 0000 on 00th i phoned the delivery company to be told that the driver was running late as he had " run out of hours " the previous day .
positive	this item that i bought is charged at £_00 by the vets i go - they charge me £_00 for the prescription which animed_direct charge £_00 . 00 and no shipping charge .
positive	i uploaded the design for my business_cards , they sent back a proof and two_days before expected they arrived .
neutral	bought a guitar funny enough , pleased with the product , nothing fancy good beginner model for our son .
negative	i bought an item with a delivery schedule of 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	the second parcel sent the following_day has_gone_missing it would appear , i gave there ref_number and they don_'_t know !
negative	bought two mattresses and picked a delivery date and then chose to spread the cost on finance .
negative	the prices on offer were very competitive and i could see no reason not to trust this organisation .
positive	the website is very easy to use , the rotary_drier is of superb quality and the delivery fast and efficient - couldn_'_t be better !
negative	customer service says ' it '_s the same as the one what you ordered '. professional outfit this is not .
neutral	annoying that i had to stop booking to email customer for a tel no but otherwise fairly simple .
negative	ordered a next working day delivery item for my holiday and specifically made arrangements to be in to receive it and then get an_email from evans telling_me that they have kindly refunded my delivery charge because this useless bunch of &^%^&$ can '_t even do their jobs - and not for the first time either .
positive	they advised me by email and the lenses are perfect .
neutral	i might have missed getting them for christmas if i hadn_'_t thought to check .
neutral	the owner of villa came out twice , and gave_me a bottle of pipe unblocker !!!!!
positive	i rung them up to order a large_amount of ocarinas .
positive	product & service , urban_industry are second to none .
neutral	order a few_days ago and kind of understand that its out of stock now !!!
positive	!
negative	call back facility on website suspended .
negative	the above is the only good thing to be said , everything about this store is disgusting , the staff are the lowest of the low , as is the atmosphere and quality of the premises .
positive	it does what it says .
neutral	i had to ring my daughter in london , she got in touch with the original company i had booked in the uk .
positive	we have used bluechip for a number of years_now and have never yet been disappointed .
positive	please_note i haven_'_t returned anything , so i can '_t vouch either way for the returns process .
negative	yodel have allegedly tried to deliver two different things to my house .
neutral	not nasty or really rude , just a bit apathetic and lacking warmth .
negative	so many problems with ebay i sell and buy elsewhere now .

positive	before ordering i phoned the shop to discuss the item ( condition , accessories etc ).
positive	excellent service with the ordering by phone and the advice , but decided to order by internet , and an week_later , had still not received it .
negative	lucky_enough i paid through paypal and have now opened a dispute .
neutral	the only problem , like a lot of modern businesses , is that they just turned_up randomly without calling , a week early in this case , hoping someone would be in !
positive	it was because of these positive_experiences that i had no_hesitation in buying an audiolab mdac from them via mail order .
neutral	i sometimes wonder_if the phrase ' 00_degrees _ positive rate of climb ; gear up ' is ever actually used on the flight deck ?
positive	i was also quite happy that i wasn_'_t forced to make an account to purchase my item .
negative	i thought hughes were a reliable company but i certainly won_'_t use them again .
positive	i could not fault the customer service at drinkstuff , even if the delivery company is not great .
negative	having been on the phone for over an_hour , he kindly_offered to say that rather_than keeping us on the phone he would guarantee someone from credit control would call us within 00_hours to take final payment of £_00 and ensure any defaults / footsteps on our credit_rating would be instantly removed .
neutral	on the alloy tubing the " beading " option is not true beading but a skim of the tube outer to leave a tiny bump ; barely adequate for hose fitting .
negative	had booked a one hour_slot first thing in the morning .
neutral	all is well with purchase except the incredible high cost but all you vet based companies know this but unfortunately you are all the same greedy . i am hoping to take this up with my local mp m . davenport

positive	- accurate product description
neutral	would think_twice before using sunglasses_shop again .
positive	i '_ll be booking through this company again !
negative	now 0_weeks after the non delivery still have no item , no resolution and item still appears on my account .

neutral	staff always seem helpful but always a wait in this shop !
neutral	good website and a easy to place order .
positive	you know what ?
neutral	!
negative	after many attempts all i got was their answer machine so i left a message .
negative	i consequently wrote a letter of complaint , sent to the address on their website .
neutral	normally the delivery side is speedy , but this time boiler_juice choose a different supply , they texted me a date , this day came and went . no oil . in fact they delivered late pm two_days_later than their text ,[ edit . i note that another has moaned about this supplier - bj take_note ] but cant moan as its within the 00 days but just as well i didn_'_t take time off for the oil man to come !
negative	have just discovered that they '_ve taken seven payments in one day from our account , we '_ve had no choice but to pass the matter to our solicitors .
neutral	not very pleased with this delivery of flowers
negative	so they had not in fact delivered the package .
positive	our shower holder broke & i ordered a new one at £_00 cheaper_than on the manufactures web_site ( including delivery ) & it was delivered just over 00_hrs after my order , with emails_confirming my order & then despatch of my order so that i knew it was on it `_s way .
negative	how could this be when the same week they were still telling_me that no one had looked at it yet ?
positive	it is easy to use and payment using credit and / or debit_card is safe .
negative	as a result of this , any_queries sent to us over the weekend or on a uk public_holiday will not be answered until the next business day .
negative	buyers pay none .
neutral	i got 0 new style ones .
neutral	when it arrived it was the wrong type of filter and when i looked at the partmaster website again the one i need is no_longer available .
neutral	it arrived the following_day but unfortunately i was not at home and the delivery man left it with neighbours who are in their 00s who had to bring it over in their car to my house .
negative	you will not be surprised that i am very concerned_about the allegations on the web that you are running some kind of scam in conjunction with ups .
neutral	they sent a two speed clipper instead of a variable one !
negative	after 0 days my product had not arrived , no i have to call customer service ( as now they have my payment ) so after phoning and leaving a message ( all there operators are busy ) no returned phone_call , eventually after several calls i got through to be told the product was delivered that day .
neutral	the customer service from serenataflowers was great as they instantly agreed that the situation was not acceptable and offered a refund or a second_attempt the next_day .
positive	both companies were very fast in dealing_with my order and finance and i would recommend them without a second thought to all my friends .
positive	could not wish for better service and would recommend this company to everyone .
neutral	well , this fiasco has cost me around £_000 in time
positive	can '_t fault merlin , have ordered on various occasions and received my order quickly .
positive	ordered on the sunday and both items delivered on tuesday .
neutral	easy to trade , but cheque took too long to arrive .
positive	communications were superb and fast keeping_me up to date on every_stage of the preparation .
neutral	i eventually received a refund on the cost of the locksmith , but would advise anyone buying a door through this company to make a note of their name and phone number , so that if the lock fails within a month of installation , you can contact them , for them to arrange a locksmith , as getting compensation is a long and arduous_task .
positive	like most people i was attracted_by the price , and the ease of use of their website .
negative	i accepted the trade - in price and they emailed to say that half of the order was missing content .
negative	- directions to the car_park were terrible .
neutral	so all fitting ' promises ' have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
negative	you get to the end of it all and the installation date .
neutral	this is misleading as only the coat ( no trousers ) is in the package with the hat separate .
negative	it was showing as available on the website .
neutral	telephone staff just said they didn_'_t know why he would not leave it .
positive	you could walk to st mark '_s square in 00_minutes - lovely .
positive	!
neutral	unfortunately the service is only as good as the courier used and my first bouquet went_astray !
negative	they will still take payment and allow you to take out extra insurance for your precious items but never tell you they are not actualy covered , untill you try to make a claim .
negative	package failed to arrive
negative	rubbish - every time i see yodel are delivering i cringe
neutral	i usually buy my train_tickets from first great western , but i switched to loco0 this time because i wanted to buy a civ ticket to ' london international ' to connect with my eurostar journey and protect me from any cancellations / delays affecting my onward jouney .
neutral	website crashes / times out often which is a little annoying .
positive	once again , thank_you for an excellent slate_sign .
neutral	i give them away as presents but always retain a copy for comparison until the next batch arrives .
negative	the only thing that i could do was to pay the £_00 a month fee for poor broadband and get tv through a 0rd_party provider that cannot provide the full virgin_media tv service .
positive	definately coming_back and using them again !
positive	envirofone were offering the best price for my iphone 0 after_reading lots of reviews about other_websites not giving the promised amout i decided to give envirofone a shot . glad that i did . very smooth and fast transaction and was given the quoted price !

negative	when i tried_calling dhl uk myself , they said they were ' acting as a third_party ' and couldn_'_t help me , or give me any other phone number .
negative	£_00 .
positive	quick a s efficient service every time
positive	they send you an e_- mail with estimated time of delivery ( 0hr_slot ).
neutral	clearly used to just dumping items and clearing off .
neutral	it would have been very helpful to have had the pick_up person give us some details as to how the car worked !
neutral	i had an_email when i first sold the phone saying my envelope was on its way and to send the phone by a certain_date to ensure my price bla_bla_bla .
neutral	ive been using the service since late - 0000 and have watched the many updates .
neutral	i made them wait outside .
negative	when you ask if their customers do read these before ordering , the response i had was " of course not "!
negative	on 0th of august i ordered two wedding_rings for me and my fiancé in slough branch in observatory shopping centre .
positive	personnel really friendly and very efficient , bent_over_backwards to accomodate me .
neutral	cut and paste previous one accepted .
positive	the meat is just wonderful , restaurant quality at home .
negative	ebay just doesn_'_t care about its customers .
positive	well_done !
neutral	you seem to be asked effectively to pay a separate premium for separate insurance to multitrip for the basic insurance , and to a different firm , osg medical_screening , for prior conditions – though i was assured that if it ever came to a claim there would be only one single procedure .
negative	hotrox are very good at the selling and orders always arrive on - time - i actually drove to the shop in nottingham to collect the item that i had the problem with and was subjected to what turned_out to be waffle about how good they are at customer service .
positive	brilliant !
neutral	in the event it took 0_days from ordering to receiving medicine but easter happened in the middle so delivery time was ok - just lack of info as to what was happening having submitted signed prescription and not possible to get through by phone as lines always busy .
negative	the worst signal i have ever_experienced .
positive	ordered malarone for a trip to the gambia , despite ordering over the christmas_period , the order arrived promptly .
neutral	i contacted customer service but i am afraid i have had no response at all
negative	i told them not to bother !!!
neutral	i flew out from gatwick on 00th_december , cold and wet day , rang skyone 00_minutes before arrival at the airport and found no one there .
neutral	well when i first started out with jpj it was great - really geared up to make a good experience for those having a go .
negative	i tried_phoning yodel ( so many_times !)
neutral	they agreed to arrange delivery for 0 . 00 pm today - duly_arrived although driver rang for directions , surprising if he had already called yesterday !
neutral	also , i left my good reading_glasses in the car and have not been contacted that they have been found yet .
neutral	will have to consider whether will use again after this bad_experience .
positive	cannot_fault this company first_class in every_aspect if you require parts look no further than this company
neutral	waited in from 0000 to 0000 as advised by carrier ( a friday ), nothing !
negative	and when i refuse to take that booking i receive rude email and threats ﻿ to be unpublished .
negative	despite my constant questioning as to why it was not being published i never had any meaningful reply from ekomi .
neutral	unfortunately they had already put 0 dents in my lovely new furniture when i pointed_out the dents the driver was very weary in his voice and stated he could ring the office but then they would have to take it away and rearrange - but since all our other furniture has already been disposed of i had little choice but to keep it dents and all .
neutral	disgraceful behaviour !
neutral	surely a graded p_+_p system could be introduced , rather_than a blanket cost ?
positive	i save so much money with them with veterinary prescriptions which is brilliant ; as that is a must with 0 dogs and four birds in today '_s economy !
positive	purchased some ghd '_s as a pressie for my sister .
negative	so after receiving an_email_saying my order had been cancelled because of my payment details , which were correct and my bank_account had plenty money in it .
positive	couldn_'_t_resist having a little taste .
positive	before fitting the tyre was advised that it may not have to be changed but it '_s totally my decision .
negative	the time that is going into all this continues to mount up - more to do next week .
positive	great way to keep in touch with family and friends when you live on the other side of the world !
positive	i '_m able to keep learning in my sixties .

negative	i did tell her in the end as it was obvious the conversation would not progress any further if i did not .
positive	priced competitively .
negative	i had two bedrooms fitted last_week .
negative	what kind of excuse is that ?

neutral	i would however like to draw attention to the driver of the bus who was in no way anything other than a driver , this may be what he is employed to do rather_than a driver who actually moves from his seat and assists the elderly and infirm with cases particularly when the cases need to be put up on the rack rather_than stored on the floor .

neutral	excellent service and cannot_fault .
positive	from the salesman and price , to the installation it was a faultless service .
positive	the goods arrived well - packaged and on the due date .
positive	the only potential downside is that i assume goods purchased from_hk will not be eligible for a uk warranty ( classed_as grey_imports ), but should anything go_wrong with the lens or future_purchases , then i just hope digitalrev can deal with the return in an efficient and painless manner as they were to deal with when buying the goods in the first place .

positive	this offer was was over 00_% cheaper then offered on airport comparison_sites what a great deal .
neutral	can '_t be bothered to return them , but wouldn_'_t order again .

neutral	i bought an alto tv_cabinet which is a nice item with clean , straight lines .
negative	i have spent the last two years moving all of my services away from them , and still they are using outdated cards to renew services that have been cancelled and they have emailed conformations of this , but still they are renewing the services .

neutral	we are then obliged to buy through these massive agencies at an_enormous mark - up or go without .
neutral	i contacted the courier company and they assured me i would have priority but they did not turn_up again as promised .
neutral	heard_nothing regarding the despatch so after 0_days i contacted them to see why i had heard_nothing .

neutral	not worned of avis being off airport , so not sure what was happening , finally picked_up by transport and taken off to their new office but late at night not too sure where we where taken , so the return of the car was a little dificult to find , but once there we where then transported back to the airport quite quickly ,
neutral	the store was grim and depressing and the service was impersonal and rushed " no_frills " i guess and you don_'_t get what you don_'_t pay for .

neutral	easy enough to fit when i read the instructions i had emailed ( rather_than those that came with the delivery ).
neutral	at faro_airport the rep was rude to a number of travellers , and there were some delays in many transfers .

negative	i had ordered a bouquet of flowers for mother '_s day to be delivered on mother '_s day ( when else would i want flowers to be delivered on mother '_s day ) and i recall paying extra for delivery cost for the service given it is for delivery on mother '_s day and it was a sunday .
negative	when we were eventually picked_up an_hour late , we were shuttled to marmaris where the driver drive around several back streets looking for another minibus , where we had to get off ours and change to the other .
neutral	i ordered flowers as a present for my girlfriend while she is at uni .
neutral	products are excellent but the delivery man expected me to collect the heavy box from him two flights of stairs below - i paid full price for delivery and that to me means to my front_door .
neutral	this is usefull for my records , why not this time ?
negative	the screen was badly fitted and didnt work properly .
negative	so i gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered mother '_s day flowers a week_ago , to be delivered on saturday .
positive	i can '_t_believe_how much money i have saved .
neutral	i also noted that prints are definitely not given any prominence on their site , which begs the question of why they are the only printer accessible direct from pe00 ?
neutral	informative emails_keeping advised of delivery was appreciated .
negative	i sent an_email to customers service right away and asked what they would do about this .
negative	not very happy sizes on web_site are wrong !
neutral	!
positive	pramworld happily price matched a cheaper quote i had from the internet .
neutral	i was informed to take a photo of the imperfections and email to them , anyone who has tried to take a photo of a mirror finish will know this is virtually_impossible .
positive	they have never_let_me down
negative	write letter to head_office in southampton , no reply , send snotty email , then get a call from ' dave ' who sounded very indian to me .
positive	ordered on line for delivery wednesday .
negative	what kind of shop is this that it has taken 0 deliveries , and nearly 0_weeks and they still_haven_'_t produced the item i have now more than paid for ?
negative	ive posted a photo of the pile pf poo the shop sent for 00 . 00 .
neutral	having selected the long_stay option because the short_stay cost was unreasonable i was offered the option of upgrading to short_stay at a price £_00 cheaper_than the original option .
neutral	won_'_t use them again .
neutral	it world have veen appropriate with a small compensation for all the bother returning the glasses , and for the delay .
negative	you actually don_'_t know what you will get .
positive	i can recommend it
negative	!
neutral	it was even on the box that contained the flowered but they were left " in a secure_location " outside of the house .
neutral	they then mistakenly charged me twice for line rental at our new property , yet another phone_call to them .
neutral	i know that this is a common way of doing things and came up again with this ' in the dark ' collection ' in geneva as ell .
negative	chemist_direct proceeded to send out only the small extras added with a delivery fee added on , increasing the cost by 00 %.
neutral	only one niggle i never seem to qualify for the free gifts , i thought that both my recent_purchases should have allowed me to claim a free watch or lip_gloss but the form said i didn_'_t qualify .
negative	never again will i use any halfords
neutral	this nearly put me off completely but i decided to pay via_paypal after redoing them all over again !
neutral	some of the data especially on the credit_score page doesn_'_t always correspond with the actual results of the companies so i then have to go a lot deeper into things which is very time_consuming . a separate summary page with the credit_score and relevant facts is exactly_what i need and use . i would also prefer to contact you by email rather_than a social_media page should i need to .
positive	my order came really quickly and i received a great special_offer .
positive	i was able to select a weekend day for delivery at no charge , and was then able to change this day at no cost when i realised it wouldn_'_t work .
positive	i was happily surprised at how low the prices were & feel that i have got a real_bargain .
neutral	delivery attempted , we will reschedule
neutral	however . convenience and an_enormous collection of spares almost makes up for it .
positive	was told between 0 - 0pm on the saturday and the fitter arrived bang_on time .
positive	very happy with mazuma , just after a couple of days i received my payment with no_problems .
negative	boxes were damaged so items we had sold in bulk had to be repackaged in our warehouse to avoid disappointing our customers ( see , that '_s good customer service on our part !)
neutral	once you bought of them , they bombard you with e_-_mails .
positive	great quality product at a competitive price .
neutral	i just would have been less nervous_about everything all day if they had said it will get delivered by 0 or something .
positive	i have been buying ecco for years .
positive	as i said super service watch as_described and i am a happy client .
neutral	service was very good , i was sent a text_message when flowers were being dispatched that morning and when they were delivered .
negative	i doubt very much that my situation was an_isolated one .
neutral	i don wish to know your order is received / the flowers are being arranged / we will be despatching on - / we have despatch by special courier / the courier may get stuck in traffic , the flowers are delivered - - and did you leave a card if left in the say - porch ?
positive	fabulous organisation and professionally run
positive	i later rang the fitting_centre the day before my chosen fitting date & they confirmed my order and what '_s more informed me i could have them fitted that same day as the tyres were already in stock .
positive	the guys at the garage were really good and i would use this service again .
negative	when i finally got through to the customer_services ( phone is always busy or not being picked_up ; also when promised to be called back , they did not do so ), i was told the 0rd item is still to be delivered .
positive	very quick to respond to any_queries .
positive	delivery came within one day of placing order and goods were exactly as_described .
negative	i still_waiting prob never get it back
neutral	i have been a loyal one . com customer for many_years with a few domains but i am actually considering leaving now .
negative	this i did and even translated the contents of each box into spanish for the spanish customs .
neutral	however , when we unpacked our delivery , we were dissapointed and angry to see that the bed ends were made of 0 peices of oak stuck together .
neutral	this means that you may like 0 hostel more than another but they get the same score from you .
neutral	i '_m paying £_000 per_month and it would have been £_00 !!
negative	unacceptable , why didnt it say they were out of stock when ordering .
positive	the vehicle itself is exceptional , the build quality is superb , so why do vw spoil the overall effect by penny pinching ( thats all i can assume it is ) on the interior finish .
neutral	spoke with this company direct and they admitted fault and apologised , so not a fault of 0wisemonkeys .
negative	a delivery company telling_me that the dishwasher never arrived with them in the first place
negative	pay a litle more use a reputable_company .
neutral	they appear to have completely ignorred this request as nothing has arrived .
negative	nothing !!
negative	without_any explanation whatsoever my review got suspended .
positive	recipient very happy !
neutral	thanking you for your time .
negative	i had to wait half an_hour whilst they tracked it down .
positive	low price , fast delivery , excellent service !
positive	he allowed_me to leave my car until i finished work and when i returned he remembered our earlier conversation and gave_me helpful advice .
negative	drivers cant be given instructions .
negative	!
positive	thankyou !
positive	could ' nt have asked for anything better .
neutral	we ' assumed ' that the door would turn_up as requested as we all heard him say black etc , as you would .
neutral	shame as easy wells great site .
negative	also the guest_house was not very good not worth £_00 a room £_00 is nearer the mark i think the hotel inspector should visit the staff can hardly speak_english and you have to explain what you want for breakfast and they still get it wrong . not impressed
positive	i decided to call the team .
negative	- one thing i have learned , if you want anything sorted , immediately refuse to deal with the person you are talking to and request a manager , they can actually be a little more helpful .
positive	this website to anyone & being my first
negative	do not use !!
neutral	don_'_t think this was made clear when ordering .
neutral	i '_ve had a mixed history with studiospares .
negative	very bad no refund still from 00th_march good luck to anyone_else do not order
neutral	nothing arrived .
negative	i so much regret that i purchased for 000_gbp on this website as my refund hasn ´_t been made .
neutral	overall the property was adequate but tired hence the headline .
positive	a very good service .
neutral	i bought these very expensive shoes as i am a normal size 0 , they are unbearable to walk in i think its the patent , strongly_recomend you try before you buy .
neutral	i have purchased better bunches of flowers at my supermarket for half the price .
positive	very well_wrapped so mattress was immaculate .
negative	never in my life experienced_such bad service or poor attitude .
positive	the order was sent very quickly , and was packed excellently , and securely .
neutral	need to look at their customer service and re - train some of their staff
negative	0 . 00pm the following_day and told that they could not deliver , they couldn_'_t find a local_florist who had the type of flowers i had ordered !
positive	went online tues_morning to to find out time_slot for later that day and delivery ( free ) was made well within time_slot of 0hr .
negative	i f you do not live in the london area do not expect good service from this awfull company .
neutral	!
neutral	it was betetr when it was a little_bit more simple .
positive	based on our dealings so far - very much recommended .
neutral	the headline_says it all .
positive	deliveries even to scotland are consistently prompt & prices represent good value .
neutral	however the boxes they send the products in by delivery are dreadful .
positive	i have used it after cleaning with a bosch home professional cylinder_vacuum about three years old and it still picked_up fluff and grit .
negative	i cannot say strongly enough that i would never advise anyone to deal with this company , their products or their staff - save_yourself a lot of trouble and shop elsewhere .
positive	he was such a sweetie even_though obviously working very hard late in the evening .
positive	it is definitely the best investment i have ever made .
neutral	i want to return one pair and am having a bit of trouble getting a returns_label as it was not in the parcel and they need to be sent back to denmark so i do not want them to get lost .
neutral	the batteries arrived on time , within three_days of normal shipping , however 0 battery is completely flat - no power !
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 out for delivery
negative	it was emma .
positive	the free extras are a super bonus , but i love that they will not only match , but beat a competitor '_s price .
neutral	ringtons_tea good as ever , ginger snaps the best in world , sultana biscults really moreish .
negative	although i originally gave them the benefit of the doubt , even_though i '_d read bad_reviews on here , i eventually got fed_up with waiting and cancelled my order .
neutral	but do '_t ever get tempted to choose any option that gets you stuck with yodel !
negative	i ordered flowers for my mums_00th_birthday on the 0 / 00 / 00 to be delivered on the 00 / 00 / 00 her_birthday , flowers were not delivered on the 00th so missed her_birthday and she leaves the country on the 00th so now a late delivery is pointless very upset as it looks like i forgot my mums_birthday have contacted eflorist by email as i am not in uk but have had no response as yet , not happy at all will not use service again will stick with interflora in future .
positive	lovely healthy things at good prices and with excellent service .
negative	not sure i have recorded every e_mail and telephone contact but here goes .

neutral	luckily , my daughter came home early on the wednesday and brought the package in .
negative	• writing to your chairman expressing my concern
positive	all was very easy , quick and pain_free
negative	this item is very small in size and weight .

negative	i was left_feeling stressed and angry and stupid for having let myself fall for such a scam .
positive	i would just like to say thank_you to hotel_direct for our fantastic stay at the thistle_hotel marble_arch .
negative	very unprofesssional company run by a person_who will quite happily make arrangements and subsequently hang up the phone and fail to attend appointments without reason .
negative	i am aware that i am required to pay import_tax , this is calculated on the value of the items and the shipping .
neutral	the mechanic who came out to fit my tyres this time was friendly , polite and efficient .
negative	all of my items were under a ( ships in 00 hour ) status which they guarantee on the website but the processing time was actually 0 business days .
negative	!
positive	very happy .
positive	would certainly do_business again .
negative	0000 numbers won_'_t let you speak to a human .
negative	when the light had not arrived by 00th_november , i emailed and received a response to say that it would be delivered to me the following working day .
neutral	they were beautifully_wrapped , but fortunately i decided to open the box to check them .
negative	!
neutral	interest_rates too high . 00 +%
neutral	i appreciate product ranges change over time , but this one is definitely inferior with only a small accessories pocket and just one shoulder_strap ( although the description says " straps ").
neutral	would i order again ?
negative	they were destined as a lovely gift to brighten easter for my seriously_ill mother and as time went on and no word of excited thanks as would be normal for her by telephone , i kept checking throughout the day on city_link who say on their site that delivery could take up until 0 . 00pm a opposed to the stimate assured me by m & s .
neutral	i asked customer_services if they could send these to me and i got a " computer says no " answer .
negative	please_beware .
negative	you need to research your stuff before you buy it '.
neutral	the racking system engineering was not great with a lack of precision in the making .
negative	i then received another email_stating the refund would only be processed if there is a defect with the size of the shoes reneging on the earlier agreement .
negative	i signed_up for giffgaff after experiencing double - billing hell with virgin , expecting something better .
positive	overall , i could not be more pleased in my dealings with tilefix .
positive	. and results in very reasonable quotes
neutral	after a number of phone_calls we had some great help from the customer service staff but i did have to go to citylink and collect the package myself as we couldn_'_t wait_until after the bank_holiday for delivery .
positive	consequently i now only use fonebank .
negative	complete clowns .
negative	please_accept our apologies if this is the case .
positive	was kept up to speed with email_updates concerning the tracking and the service was efficient and rapid .
neutral	when we ordered our ladders online , there was no notice saying that they only had one set in stock .

negative	will not go back at all .
positive	which arrived 00_mins into that 0 hour_slot .
positive	very good company to deal with would certainly recommended them to friends or to my customers .
negative	products didn_'_t arrive as promised .
neutral	however , that was a friday and the box was duly delivered the following_monday .
negative	" erm i '_ll do it tomorrow " they spoke to me with no respect what so ever .
negative	i posted on here four days ago re : gig etickets that were unavailable to print ( and the expense of a trip_abroad for 0 people wasted on the back of this - review included here ).
neutral	the tyre_fitter undertook the replacement of four tyres promptly .
negative	i wrote to dpd but was totally_ignored .
positive	my partner usually orders our products from lf but i have done so before too and have had the same reliable service .

neutral	the packaging on the sausages was damaged , but luckily the meat was ok .
positive	the product itself is top_class and suffice to say i will be placing similiar orders for other special occasions over the next few_months .
negative	i '_ve tried_ringing once but they weren_'_t very helpful .
negative	i specifically stated on several_occasions that i wanted the item replaced with the correct item that i had originally ordered , so again i emailed them a few_days_later , and asked what was happening , and was told they had just refunded the order and that was my lot basically .
positive	it is very easy to use , the feedback from other customers is really useful as a guide and the topcashback customer service is very good .
positive	have been going to the same tyre place for 00 years - was checking typical prices online and decided i ' d give blackcircles a try .
neutral	ordered blinds , when they were delivered on 00th only part of the order was received , the other part had become detached from the order .

positive	the service was excellent and would certainly recommend !
neutral	much harder to tear into smaller strips for protecting finger joints .
positive	i needed to transfer some money back to my bank_account in new_zealand , and i was going to do it through my bank as they advertised a £ 0 fee for international transfers .
positive	thanks .
negative	absolute_rubbish .
neutral	good priced coffee_capsules but not as good quality coffee / crema as nespresso .
neutral	i am still currently_waiting for them to arrange_collection of their oil .
positive	goods arrived_safely .

neutral	but then absolutely no further communication until a despatch_notification almost a month later .
positive	will_definitely purchase again !
neutral	why not send confirmation when order is delivered ?

neutral	luckily the table eventually arrived at 00 : 00 , 0 hours late .
neutral	0pm with a delivery time for 0 hours_later ( between 0000 - 0000 ).
neutral	i ended_up cutting and tapering the ends of each strap to make it easier for me to grip the end so i could pull the velcro apart to take the boot off .

neutral	i e_- mailed villa_plus on my return asking what they intended to do about the loss we had suffered £_00 approx but have had no response .

positive	easy to order and fast delivery of items .
negative	i ' d rather pay more and not have to chase up an order .
positive	i '_ll be using these_guys again .

negative	i particularly_liked the pattern , so persevered , then found the next size was in stock so ordered them and asked for a refund on the other items .
negative	i contacted customer service about a problem and the response was unsatisfactory .
neutral	good layout and design and visually classy looking .
negative	now taken it to the ombudsman because they won_'_t do anything more .
positive	everything about this company has_been fantastic , very efficient and easy to work with - from the simple yet informative website and easy ordering to efficient delivery service .

negative	• i will be forwarding details to your trading body
neutral	the furniture was delivered on time which was good .
neutral	unfortunately , one has a scratch just above the engraving ( if it had been on the underside this would not have been noiticed , so rather spoils a great looking gift ) ie one is perfect , one is not - shame ( also had something sticky on it , luckily i managed to remove this ) thanks anyway
neutral	when you pay for ' next_day delivery ' on a thursday you do not expect to wait_until the following_monday !!

neutral	as it had past 0pm i knew this meant it be the wednesday i received the goods which was fine with me .
positive	i can '_t speak highly_enough of mazuma '_s way of disposing of my mobile_phone and i get paid for it as well .
neutral	the only problem is one of the jersey '_s was a " woman - size large ", and it defintely is not a size large - more like a small , possibly a medium .
neutral	the tyre took an extra 0 days to be delivered .
negative	avoid at all costs and find a reputable_company to deal with .
negative	shocking ?
neutral	one big negative was the wifi .
neutral	in addition the top table name was incorrectly spelt on the plan but was correct on the table cards .

positive	will use again
neutral	fortunately astrocast are sending me the correct grid .
positive	quick dispatch , well_packaged , nice sturdy_cardboard_box !
neutral	unfortunately on the day it was due to be delivered , the courier contacted me and said they had not received it for delivery .
positive	kept up to date with e_mails on progress of order .
negative	any alternative give at that time was minimum 000_euro more_expensive . a malfunction in the website was the excuse but no help was given to find a place to stay within the budget .
positive	i haven_'_t bought any other items from cheapsmells so i can '_t comment but looking at the prices i would say if you find what your looking for you would be saving money . :)
positive	they '_ve got the whole varlight range and the one time i had problems , the product was replaced very quickly .
neutral	the de - wormer on the website page stated that the product was 000_% effective for all worms usually found to effect cats , which is whay i ordered it .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from other online sources of american products , and this order was the least well - packed of those i have received .
negative	no wonder by the time you do get to speak to someone you are at the end of your theater poor souls working for a company where you have to take all the flak !
neutral	!
negative	but you ’ re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
positive	many_thanks .
negative	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
negative	he said he '_d send me the pac_code within two hours .
neutral	i hope so as would expect a bit more from the money i spent .
positive	thank_you , first_class *****
positive	what more can you ask , genuine product , fast delivery , good price .
negative	the box they came in was damaged , the flowers arrived with some damage and they didn_'_t look like the ones chosen on the website , they looked like something you can get in a petrol_station , cheap and nasty !
neutral	i did consider returning them , but the electrician was standing beside me waiting to install them ( i bought two wall - lights and a hanging pendant ) and i didn_'_t want to have to wait while i went through the whole_process again .
negative	confirming the pick_up online was useless , the time was not posted in the timescales advised .
neutral	it was a mixed experience
negative	the maximum it should be is 0 days .
negative	this just goes to prove that if you complain loudly enough and publicly enough , your voice will be heard .
neutral	the reason i am particularly upset about this is because my dear boyfriend did not get his_birthday_present in time .
positive	a few short click throughs and i '_ve found exactly_what i '_m looking for and for the cheapest price i can find .
neutral	arrived very quickly but wrong color not large enough for my shower
neutral	the inside of cupboards , wardrobes and drawers all had the horrid smell , so had to be left open for days .
positive	i have had my own exhibition since and exhibited in two others this year .
negative	when you order something online you expect the picture you see to be what you get the bunch that was received looks nothing like it hardly_any flowers all scrunched_up
negative	what a joke nobody can tell you the truth .
positive	i ordered a dining_suite , dresser , bookcase and two coffee_tables .
neutral	we got there in the end .
positive	created a photo_book for our daughter '_s 00st and are very pleased with the result .
negative	i now find that replies left for me by others have disappeared , any other negative_reviews are taken down , and yet again we have a situation where a company is burying the truth about their appalling service .
positive	helpful pre_- sales service ( on issues such as matching tap sizes to smaller_than conventional basins ) and good clear_instructions about delivery and any post - delivery problems .
positive	i popped_into the store and got it .
negative	also the flowers did not resemble in the slightest the ones on the photo .
neutral	deliveries were made as promised .

neutral	my sick_friend could not even see the package and would not have known about it , if a visitor had not brought it up to the house .
negative	do i have to check the whole delivery on arrival before the driver leaves this is ridiculous i am not happy as you can_imagine .

positive	they had exactly_what i was looking for , competitively_priced , help confirming yardage and the purchase made in a very friendly professional way .
negative	yes it was raining but there was no excuse for health and safety issues , the staff were cramming people onto the bus even_though there were no seats or safe standing areas left , people were allowed to stand on the stairs which left you having to come down on the narrowest of stair area .

positive	lovely looking flower_arrangements etc , value for money and next_day delivery 00 / 00 / 00 wednesday .
negative	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer service via his customer service line .
neutral	i wasn_'_t best pleased i had been waiting in all morning for no reason .
negative	i said no that was the only card i had .
negative	our flowers were never delivered as they were sent to the wrong_address and they were bought for our friend who sadly lost her_husband and the sympathy card was never delivered either - how utterly appalling and discusting and we are so very annoyed by this and as yet no refund and no flowers for our friend whose husband died !

neutral	paying almost £_00 for flowers i hadn_'_t ordered was disappointing .

positive	car went through with no_problems and i was pleased that there were none of the usual " add - ons ".

positive	easy instructions to follow driver meets you at drop_off point .
positive	going to use them all the time now .
negative	i sent another email to the company who still refuse to give refund , only offering another bunch of flowers .
negative	the support and system is really crap , they limit legal businesses as well and should avoid at all costs
neutral	however the reception isn_'_t great in all areas .

neutral	i needed some body solder bars recently and sent my order into frost in the u . k ., however i was shocked to find the cost of shipping a small package which weighed a few_pounds was so expensive .

neutral	it was next_day delivery and i didn_'_t recieve it next_day so i rang them two_days_later to chase .

positive	none the less they looked beautiful and were great value for money .
positive	was really impressed with their service and paperwork side of things too so will_definitely try them first next time we go .
neutral	i would probably try somewhere_else .
negative	after bringing this issue up with the operator she told me that most people don_'_t use the cheapest option anyway as it is very slow so after a lot of debate i went with the code and paid more for the 0 - 0 day shipping instead of forgoing the code and choosing the cheaper option .
positive	i have been ordering products from aria for many_years .

negative	i called parcel0go , the agency who made the booking and took the payment , they said they couldn_'_t act until three_days had passed .
negative	and then , after much wasted time that i '_ll never get back , when i finally got my pac - this actually made me laugh out loud - the woman had the gall to say " oh if you want to stay with us then we '_ll give you three_months ' free service "!
negative	my order placed 0th_december still_hasn_'_t arrived .
positive	delivery was swift .
neutral	the friction was the cost . at_least dick turpin had the decency to wear a mask .

positive	i ordered a barbour_jacket from country_house_outdoor .
positive	it was easy and the best price i could find .
negative	comforting to know that the school office and any of the kids they use as runners can now access my account .
negative	i had been disappointed that the promised savings did not materialise but i blamed myself for not seeing the information about standing charges etc .
negative	because i never got a confirmation_email the first i knew if the beanbag being the wrong_colour was when it turned_up .
neutral	my only complaint is that they had been tried on previously and the soles were quite dirty , but did not look as though they had been worn for a round of golf so i kept them .
negative	after numerous e_- mails to play '_s customer service i was still unable to secure a delivery date .
neutral	good choice of suites but be prepared to pay more than what '_s on the price_tag .
positive	thank_you so much for your speedy service .
positive	amazingly quick delivery , great items at reasonable rates .

negative	there is no excuse for mucking orders up , especially to the same customer twice and i bet i am not the only one who had this experience !
neutral	did finally receive the discount in the form of a partial_refund but only after i sent a message and got deferred to somebody_else .
neutral	sounds petty but they were for a present
negative	very disappointing .

( didn_'_t have the decency to let_me know before i left home , or advise me how this was going to work ) i had to waste money that they are not not happy to refund as it wasn_'_t their fault .
neutral	all_round a satisfactory purchase .
negative	so i had to write an_email to thier customer service email address and hope for the best .

neutral	use of online buying , ok to start with , but a long delivery item was not notified until i enquired .
neutral	a message i sent to customer_services to check the address i entered was correct was replied to quickly and well .
neutral	this was not mentioned anywhere and i had thought the price that your web_site quoted would be the price .
negative	have been trying for three_days to get through to this company , to pay my disabled and elderly mothers electricity_bill , average of over an_hour eating every day regardless of the time of day , definitely will be changing provider to eon , disgraceful service !!!
neutral	mrs heather kay
neutral	recieved our order within two_days .
negative	absolutely_useless .
neutral	a plumber who i asked to come in , broke them getting them off .
neutral	so after another half hour wait i eventually collected the car .
neutral	i also found out that this wasn_'_t the actual policy of the rental company that supplied the car but just that of the individual policy / agreement that holiday_autos use .
negative	if completely alienating your customers for absolutely no reason is keeping you in business then who am i to suggest your terms and conditions suck .
negative	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
negative	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
positive	eaasy to fit .
negative	then i had a knock at my door at 0am which was yodel , shockingly out of order as they are meant to call and arrange the appointment and 0am , really !!!
positive	would and do highly_recommend .
positive	quick delivery .
neutral	a quick couple of taps on the lungo button resolved the issue , but there certainly isn_'_t full compatibility there yet and i have no idea if this is causing any damage to the machine .
positive	0 days_later delivered , couldn_'_t be_happier .
negative	when the shoes arrived , one pair looked worn with the elastic side strap already lose and stretched and the boots were designed so badly the angle at the ankle made it impossible to fit the foot into the boot .
negative	i ring them , they will come_back straight_away , 0 hours_later , no call , ring again , will come_back , still_waiting .
positive	helped_us have an amazing night !
neutral	advised iflorist by e_mail .
negative	if rejected , £ 0 to return phone
neutral	ordered a photo mug for a colleague and it arrived with a couple of small scratches on it and there was not enough time to reorder or get a replacement in time .

negative	it will be interesting to see if this edited review is challenged by shiply
positive	the service is extremely fast and very well priced .
positive	i have to say that from the first contact up to the last contact with the very helpful delivery driver this purchase went very well .
negative	never mind the fact i have already had to purchase another bunch from elsewhere .
negative	this is very annoying .
positive	at first i was a little_dubious_about ordering a “ refurbished ” watch , but those doubts were soon put to rest once i visited the store located in the royal_exchange at bank .
neutral	furniture is fine , but make_sure ou protect all carpets as boxes and delivere feet are filthy .
negative	this company caused me and my wife much stress and threatened us on numerous_occasions due to their poor customer_services .
neutral	service fine , but instruction what to do with key not found by me !
negative	on the plus_side , partyrame stock everything required for a party .
negative	i '_m surprised at how i '_m now being treated by dolphin .
positive	i found them much_better_than i expected for the money .
positive	one of our clothing rails broke so i went online , found their ordering really easy to use and the item was delivered a day later plus they emailed me in advance to let_me know the courier and consignment_number .
negative	i ordered an automatic fire_extinguisher well within the ' next_day ' delivery time as indicated on the web_site on thursday ; today as i write on monday - 0 days_later nothing has arrived .
negative	i had no food it except bread and so had to sent my daughters 0 and 00 too bed with 0 slices of toast , in which i felt awful ( that was there tea ) . this was so upsetting , not having food which you have rightly paid for .
positive	we '_ll definitely use oak_furniture_land again in the future .
neutral	don_'_t expect to be sent items with damaged packaging , but otherwise good .
positive	the order was delivered within a few_days and was free delivery too !
positive	they ' re my first choice when it comes to sourcing quality sports_gear online .
positive	we ordered on the sunday and our coffee_machine was delivered on the wednesday .
negative	i guess i will just have to buy elsewhere that will be able to send me my items in a reasonable amount of time and just have extra '_s once bodyjewelleryshop decide to send me my order .
positive	!
positive	i have to say being a web based service it does what it says on the tin .
neutral	- poor office conditions .
neutral	what do you do ??
neutral	" simple " i hear you say and indeed it is my preferred option of doing things , however .
positive	seems like good service to me .
neutral	i had to chase for my finance paperwork to be completed , once this was done i then had an_email to tell me my car would be delivered to the supplier on a certain_date .
neutral	i also prefer to choose my seat at check in , rather_than enter a 000m sprint to the aircraft steps .
negative	this was sent back my royal_mail .
negative	if ekomi are filtering out low ratings they are deliberately distorting the true picture of the feedback process , this may well put companies in a good light but i believe it '_s actions not only undermine the entire customer reviews process it distorts the truth and deliberately misleads the customer .
negative	00_minutes later , my phone blared at me again , another person from fitness first with the same intentions .
negative	emailed back asking for the ' correct tap ' to be delivered the next_day .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	buchungen waren bislang gut und korrekt .
positive	p - price , most competitive on the web , includes postage so no_hidden_charges .
positive	would have no_hesitation_recommending to friends and family and came back on tonight to order something_else .
negative	went to the basingstoke shop that evening , started to fill in the form etc .
negative	at_least to her credit she did phone back earlier_than promised with the details and said she would send an invoice - and a joiner '_s package .
neutral	! maybe bank_holiday delay ?
neutral	the information cards in the door of the car were not for the car that i was driving
neutral	it '_s far from sharp !!
positive	being quoted half the price of a ' well_known ' competitor ( oh , i may have already given a clue ) i decided to give them a try .
positive	ive recommend to anyone to purchase from here
positive	hen_heaven were easy to use and really good value for the money .

positive	not too contemporary , not too rustic - just right - and comfortable to boot .
neutral	room was ok but food was very poor and my partner had an upset_stomach by the morning .
negative	a sad affair .
negative	i called over and over to find out when they were arriving for me and could get no answer .
positive	always very helpful .
neutral	the product was not as expected and the exchange was fuss free .
positive	i '_ll be going to hostelbooker . com to book the rest of my hostels for my backpacking_trip through europe , thank_you !
neutral	in the end i had to request a change of password , even_though i '_d never set one up in the first place .
neutral	they were delivered on the same day , and i was impressed with the turnaround .

positive	a very helpful assistant ( josh ) helped_me decide on a style & size , my husband is delighted with his jacket & size is perfect .
neutral	when i received the invoice the value of the car was £ 0000 + £_00 rfl + £_00 petrol .
positive	we were kept_informed of order progress by email and space heater arrived several days earlier_than we thought when we ordered .
positive	i have no connection with the business other than being a very satisifed customer .
negative	my friends were all completed shocked , as gakk has always been seen as upstanding .
positive	this was the first time that i have used this service and will recomend sds to anyone looking for ironmongery .
neutral	worse still , having driven all the way to the store , returned the item and got a refund , if you order a replacement in store you don_'_t get free delivery .
neutral	my partner was rather surprised when he saw the van , it was quite old and very obvious that the item to be transported , a wardrobe , would not go into the van in the
neutral	sometimes old promotions are not removed so disappointment is felt when one comes to order .
negative	i am never going to use your service again .

neutral	!
neutral	i would like to suggest that if a picture is going to be blown up over a double page spread or if the quality isn_'_t perhaps up to scratch , that jessops and cewe warn you , either by a pop - up or by contacting you directly as i would have then been warned and my expectations would not have been so high .
neutral	i was informed that they had a problem with a batch of chasis and they were meant to be in tomorrow ( thursday ) the guy said he would rush the build due to the wait and put the pc on special saturday delivery if it was ready to post on friday .
negative	i want this sorting asap .
positive	i would recommend to anyone .
negative	the roses that were delivered were dead .
neutral	all in all i got the results that i expected and i didn_'_t have any_problems but i wouldn_'_t go as far as to call the service good or excellent .
negative	i pains me to even give them 0_star !
neutral	the prices they pay are not mega but if you want to get_rid of stuff and actually earn some money for it then it `_s ok .
neutral	on the plus_side it was a very good price and it arrived on the date promised .
positive	this was easy - popped in the requirements and the quote comes up - reasonable - pay on line and just get there on the day - easy_peasy !
negative	anyway , before i started ranting about this , the web_page tells you to type this as if speaking to a friend .

positive	knowing they would arrive in time and exactly as ordered !
negative	don_'_t waste your money .
positive	the swift service was not to be_faulted and although i forgot to claim a discount customer_services quickly rectified this when asked .

neutral	ridiculous .
negative	their cost for parts and labour ( 00 minute job ) £_000 plus_vat .
negative	every time i email customer_services i am ignored .
positive	free p_&_p would be the icing_on the cake , but i '_m not complaining .
positive	i ordered online and the goods were with me within 0 days in switzerland .
positive	good quality goods always exceeds_expectations
neutral	i ordered 0 taps .

neutral	!
negative	yes within 0 days was there reply .
neutral	don_'_t use if you want your goods quickly but if not in a rush worth the wait .
negative	phoned ccl again , was told to return pc , which i did on 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	i did call to enquire_about a lack of email confirmation that the printer was being shipped on time and was put through to a polite but rather lack - lustre and seemingly disinterested customer service employee who explained that they had no further information on my order other than what i could see myself when logged in to the " my orders " section of their website which i found quite astonishing .
positive	in other words it has almost everything that every web master ( not just beginner !)
positive	i was kept_informed about my order every_step of the way .

neutral	disappointed .
positive	items are always exactly as shown .

negative	don_'_t touch with a ten foot barge_pole ( unless you '_ve got plenty time on your hands & money to burn ).

neutral	i always send flowers to my lovely auntie and they always make her smile and that smile lasts while the flowers bloom . her smile didnt not last long with your flowers sad to say wont_be sending flower this way again .
positive	they have a massive_range of products and excellent delivery times .
positive	i was really pleased easy to order and very reasonable_price considering it '_s valentine
positive	thanks .
negative	they couldn_'_t give a monkey '_s .
negative	the most infuriating thing is that they mustn '_t read the multitude of reviews that complain_about their customer_services , or they do and they ignore it which must be worse .
positive	the furniture arrived when it said it would .
neutral	not a good food choice for children and there were quite a few children on board thought there would be more .
neutral	now , let_me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
negative	i have lost £_00 and the car !
neutral	i have done full maintenance tasks on my printer , cleaning printheads etc , yet after printing just 0 test pages and one calibration page my printer tells_me that the colour_cartridge ink level is very low , in fact every time i checked print ink_levels , even without printing anything , the ink level in the colour_cartridge decreased dramatically .

negative	i now have to wait 0 - 0 days to get my money back .
positive	i telephoned the caravan manufacturers and they suggested that i just googled the key number , which i did and bingo .
neutral	this should have been signalled upfront particularly as i was considering paying more for next_day delivery ( i '_m_glad i didn_'_t as that would have been money wasted ).
negative	they will be passed there use by date at this rate .
negative	even with the groupon this has cost around £_00 and i '_m just not happy .
negative	my mobile contract is with talktalk have had limited service or none for 0_days .
negative	i had to use my bt landline to contact them as i had no signal at home .
positive	tested out the website / programme to see if it could indeed check which ram my system used - and it did .
negative	had i not been the first in line i would have been stuck in sfo - the flight was indeed overbooked .
negative	when we went back to drumstop they advised us to wait_until their next stock check was completed and they would confirm if they were ' overstocked ' on the missing cymbals .
neutral	i love the ebay concept and making pocket money from the site is always great .
positive	trying to upgrade the ram on my old pc and my order was logged at 0 . 00pm .
positive	staff were very friendly and helpful .
neutral	the bottle of sherry survived without damage .

neutral	apart_from that slightly unnerving experience it was a great trip and terrific value for money .
negative	since then i '_ve had almost daily emails re collection an there have been 0 or0 ( i '_ve lost_count ) attempts to collect it from my house .
neutral	bad_experiences with yodel on previous deliveries , thought ups would be better but i was wrong ; couldn_'_t contact their local_depot at all , couldn_'_t make changes to delivery on their site as i was supposed to be able to .
positive	faultless review system resulting in great community communication .
negative	i phoned immediately upon realising that it wasn_'_t a meet and greet and was told to email and they would cancel it from their system .
negative	just unacceptable .
negative	wud come out with keys but needed £_00 extra to do so !!
positive	we live in a fairly large apartment with carpet , ceramic tiles and " karndean " type flooring and it handles them all with ease .
positive	my new ' big perm ' from fancy_dress ball is amazing .
positive	part as specified
negative	i for one am fed_up misleading images & information !
positive	but the tyre was there and fitted when it was supposed to be so all good .
neutral	however my parcel was delivered to totally the wrong_address and person inspite of it being labelled with my name , address and postcode clearly .
neutral	getting an rma_number is a bit_slow .
negative	i don_'_t know how this company is still in business .
positive	other stores i looked at for the same mattress couldn_'_t deliver for 0 to 0_weeks and cost nearly double .
negative	told we would only be able to have the hard_drive back – not the whole pc - even_though it has extra drive added by us and is our property .
neutral	when i didn_'_t hear that my sister had received the flowers , i phoned the receptionist and she said she was not aware the box contained flowers .
neutral	smooth flight but don_'_t think worth the money .
negative	until now .

positive	- they transfer cash to your bank .
neutral	we '_ve purchased an entire bathroom for our new property and whilst it looks great , the plumber has had major problems with the poor quality plumbing fittings provided .
negative	and the thing is , all i got was a refund , with zero compensation for wasting my time and having my money for those two months .
positive	i was very impressed with your service and contact .
positive	so i did some extensive_searching and came_across this website .
negative	had a tearful telephone_conversation with my cousin . she has_been so supportive to me and i owe her big style .
positive	quick delivery and great products .
positive	they are great at keeping us updated on the status of a job and will always help in whatever way possible .
neutral	i would have liked to have returned them but having done all the work to put them down we tried to put damaged tiles out of the way .
negative	i just want my order !
neutral	i must_admit to have been worried_about not hearing_anything about the dispatch of my order and it took them 00_hours to respond ( which they do state as being their target ).
positive	i am a very happy customer
neutral	i am 00 years old , a property owner , with above national average savings .
negative	i then tried to call the customer_services number supplied on the base of the paperwork , only to find out they no_longer accept calls .
positive	i wanted to save_money and i did lots of it . had to change an headgasket on my vw bora tdi 000 pd bought the crank , cam lock kit did the job myself got new headgasket and timing_belt kit and waterpump from v . w est £_000 v . w wanted £ 0000 to do the job got the crank , cam lock kit off toolstop the next_day and saved caaaching £ 0000 thankyou very much toolstop deffo shop with you again .
negative	forsinket levering , 0 dg blev til 00 .
negative	you also told me that you were going to have the it department change the adverts going forward .
positive	goods dispatched promptly .
neutral	although may be seen as convenient , when you actually take into account delivery time it can be a week before your receive items by which time you would need to go do your own shopping for items anyway .
positive	some isps will help , others ( like aol ) wont .
positive	marvin and team were great , helped a thicko like me with great patience , in the end i felt positively clever .
negative	meg kent worcestershire
neutral	so overall the shine was taken off the new toy by a poor product but i can '_t complain_about the service .
neutral	so instead of putting in another order for more than £_000 plus exchanging the bedding i got to a larger_size which i would have paid the difference in price .
negative	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
positive	my order came on time with no issue '_s and was packaged great .
neutral	many of my friends have the same opinions
positive	from first email to finished_product the service was outstanding .
positive	very easy , very quick and payment made to my account without_any delays .
positive	it was brill thanks a lot . atb .
negative	let '_s see what their customer_services says as i '_m still_waiting to hear back from them .
positive	i was so impressed sold my phone over the xmas_period thought it would drag on but got email confirmtion the minute my phone arrived , ended_up asking for a cheque to be sent , got email_confirmation again when it was sent out , arrived and was banked less_than a week .
neutral	but they are not so generous with part exchange if at a later date you want to upgrade to a more_expensive watch .
negative	so i wrote to phansord @ thompson - morgan . com managing_director , mr paul hansord direct email
neutral	i had no problem booking on line as a foot_passenger everything went perfectly .
neutral	i tried seven or eight times , even on different days , at which point my onlooker husband wanted to abandon it and go to another site .
positive	pre orders come 0 / 0 days before release and its hard to beat their prices anywhere_else .
neutral	the flowers were sitting_outside the entire time .
positive	i would recommend them to everyone who_wants a high_quality product .
neutral	our 0st try to buy the imist 0 ended when the website said it was out of stock , so we went and bought a competitors product which does not need to be filled .
neutral	however , one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing_customers , they no_longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small_amount meaning they are no_longer benefiting their existing_customers , who may now decide to leave .
positive	would highly_recommend this company and will absolutely be using again !
negative	they are not prepared to refund the short_stay car_parking charges as they say they contacted us - which is a lie !
negative	i had no card and also have cctv on our apartments . yet no one except for the postman that morning had attempted delivery .

positive	highly_recommended .
positive	on return the car was waiting for us , we got in and headed straight home in know time fabulous .
negative	i have never had this problem before & i have been very pleased with my orders in the past .
neutral	i believed i had hired 0 baby seats included on the online booking , at no point did it mention any additional_cost .
negative	it almost seems like they hope if they ignore customers or make it difficult to contact them that anyone who complains will give up and put it down to experience , but i am not willing to do this on principle so i will keep contacting them until i get a satisfactory reply .
positive	i did worry_about the quality at first as the price was so much_cheaper_than others but when the posters arrived promptly i was really impressed .
positive	i was searching the internet to find the best deals for cartridges for my hp 0in0 printer as my colour had run_out .
neutral	plus i have to pay to post back !
neutral	" how is that possible ?
neutral	after four days the order status was still at " processing ".
positive	wearing them today in florida .
negative	i ordered a product , not a rarity , a rug sac .
negative	too late .
positive	helpful and concise .
negative	they will not ship the item in stock so i now have to wait 0 . 0 months to receive my order , which has already been paid for and for which i had been mis_- informed twice .
negative	ordered a product online with no store near - by , the product then became_faulty after 0 months , i used my order number to view the order online and it had an option to return and book a courier , i did this and no courier came , so i booked another day and no courier came .
negative	after receiving my order very promptly i may add i was very dissapointed in the quality of the material !
negative	lesson_learnt .

positive	it was considerably_cheaper_than elsewhere !
negative	we had booked a pick_up from heathrow .
neutral	as above plus i thought some of the material was quite superficial and in one area the content was wrong re bandura '_s social learning theory .
positive	we have never had an issue with them and effectively they are invisible once you have booked .
negative	i telephoned the company to let them know of their mistake , only to be very rudely_told to " get a life , go to b_& q and buy another light " and was then told to " go forth & multiply " ( only not quite so politely ) and the phone was put down on me !
negative	can '_t wait_until viovet change their delivery service !
neutral	paul '_s efforts have at_least given me confidence to give dawson '_s another try in future and hopefully they '_ll earn 0_stars !
negative	our experience with hammonds has_been absolutely horrendous .
negative	i have been given excuses like they have a backlog , the driver isnt answering his phone , the drivers are behind because they cant go out until the hub arrives ?
negative	ordered the flowers before 00 : 00 and minutes afterwards had the call to say the op had been cancelled .
neutral	however when looking on the website i was still able to add the same pair of shoes to my basket and given the option to pay for them when they were apparently out of stock .
positive	excellent product , delivery and overall service well_done !
negative	!
neutral	i have scallop - edged knives and they are excellent ; i simply wanted a larger one .
neutral	i purchase 00 cup handles for my kitchen draws and cupboards excellent choice look stunning however 0 of the handles had not been tapped to the correct depth , minor_problem i had to purchase some washers to fix he problem .
negative	it took two months to finally get a refund !!!
negative	honestly i was so fine with bt but then i gave them a go , just to save me some money but will not call them again , they keep send me from one department to another , and the computer technicians know less_than me . the problem is the router i told them but i '_m not allowed to upgrade , right . but new customers have half the price and better routers . that '_s nice
neutral	i then realised i had made a mistake on the engraving so tried online_chat again and got better service and engraving changed .
positive	the end product is first_class with deadlines met .
negative	i then sent them a few messages directly through the contact form on the website with no luck .
neutral	sewing is not my best talent !
neutral	why does 0 phones get sent and only 0 get there but 0 in each bag and it has to be the iphone not very happy at all , why the 0 phone get there which add up to £_00 but the 0 which was a iphone £_00 get loss !!!!?!!
neutral	however the customer_support is pathetic .
negative	their customer service advisors are amazingly rude .
positive	i will use you again and recommend to my running mates too .
neutral	booking successful .
positive	they did exactly_what they promised and paid me promptly , pretty_much by return .
positive	can '_t fault .
positive	don_'_t waste your time looking at other solutions - this is the one to go for !
positive	really easy to use the site , and good prices .
neutral	this said they were very quick to refund the money .

positive	good choice and price and delivered on time
positive	the service offered by sell your laptop was excellent - the price offered for my laptop was well above any other website that i tried , the choice of postage methods suited my working week and the speed with which the laptop was received and processed far quicker_than i was expecting ( i was emailed the morning after_posting the laptop to say it had been received , then again the same afternoon to say it had been processed and attaching the invoice for my payment ).
neutral	also , the colour of the ponytail was a lot blonder than i '_d expected .
negative	thank_goodness for john_lewis they had the item at the same price and did not charge for delivery .

neutral	a picture would have helped .
negative	viagogo response ( not followed up despite my providing the info requested ):

negative	it '_s now been 0 working_days and they still have my money .
positive	pleasure to deal with a firm that not only takes your order but were very interactive with the client keeping them abreast of where the order was and ensuring that on delivery everything was as expected .
neutral	this isn_'_t acceptable you '_d think in this modern age that if someone has the handwriting of a 0 year_old that they would have the card printed instead .
negative	i know tickets can cost a lot if trying to get them at the last_minute , but surely not months before , i was so shocked that i had been charged sooo_much extra , yes i knew i would be charged a bit , but more than double , viagogo is on a real good thing ,

negative	never never never buy from groupon .
neutral	despite it showing " in stock " when i ordered , it was out of stock when they processed my order and that delay in sourcing more from supplier meant it arrived after i left for my holiday .
positive	they also are so easy to order with and give you plenty of opportunities to add the little pieces on such as vases and teddy '_s , the little extras id forget otherwise .
negative	unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances i had to cancel the order on 00 / 0 / 00 , but was told the item hadn_'_t been shipped so all was ok .

neutral	i wanted to add the easy open spine .
negative	it would have cost us over_£ 0 , 000 to make the car safe and as a result meant we had to sell it for scrap !
neutral	in the uk it is unusual to offer £_00 notes let_alone £_000 ones which is the nearest to these so why do travelex use them ?

neutral	these are the same thickness as my old glasses !

neutral	the 0 %_off competitors preices is nice if you have all day to commpare every_single product . believe it or not i like the site ok but even when i inquired_about how a free_sample really costs money they send back an almost pissed_off response about how cheap all their stuff is and how it really costs and other nonesense .

positive	i found the web_site easy to navigate .
negative	i have yet to receive notification and had to ask my friends if they had received the flowers .

negative	i just want my money back !.
negative	they did not deliver until after lunchtime the following_day and despite 0 messages from me vis their website they have given no apology and no explanation .

positive	what more could a person want ?
negative	need to do a lot better with customer service !

positive	i would recommend flowerbags to anyone !
neutral	on the car .
neutral	i think its very bad that you pay a lot of money for a lovely display of flowers + chocs and people spend a lot time preparing the display for a nice_surprise for somebody to have it all wasted by a real bad delivery service . the flowers and chocs were left out side a block of flats at 0pm they did not ring the bell the person_who lived there is house bound and was in to get the door the only way she got the flowers is when i phoned at 0pm and asked her if she got them and she went out to find them .

neutral	he promised some of his best cherries when they were in season as goodwill .
neutral	however the only reason for the three star_rating and not five is that the products build quality is decreasing rapidly .
neutral	. better service from ebay traders . product however is very good .
neutral	in the description , it stated that the flute had slight blemishes and marks , but to see them you would have to look very closely in the light to spot them .

positive	happy all_round .
neutral	i ended_up being referred on the telephone in eire .
negative	i ordered and paid for a print to be made and delivered at the most expensive next_day delivery ( for a birthday_gift ).

positive	), as it got held in one of their depots for a few_days missing the saturday delivery i paid extra for .
positive	we looked at various_options for booking the holiday but decided to stick with travel_republic because it has a good reputation and competitive_prices .
neutral	for me there is a design flaw as there is a gap across front between top and bottom doors and this shows white , ok if it was a white model but doesn_'_t look good on the silver , would look better if doors were flush .
positive	even better_than we thought they would look .
negative	i actually happened to visit this friend 0_days_later and saw the bouguet - it was nothing like the one on the website .
neutral	good booking_system , efficient check in and out at reception .

neutral	i think it was poor of them not to even attempt to knock on the front_door and actually do their job .
positive	espares seems to stock everything needed to repair every household_appliance instead of having to buy a new appliance which saves money all the way .
negative	they also said they they didn_'_t recognise my phone number or post_code .
negative	they refunded me one of the charges ( out of two ) without bothering to tell me or answer my questions so right now i have no idea what remains booked and what doesn_'_t complete_joke .

neutral	the delivery was very quick and was impressed by this however the major letdown was having to unroll it out of the ball it had been screwed_up into and flung in a bag - having to iron it before i could even consider letting him see it - a product of this quality i would have expected that the time could have at_least been taken to fold it overall good product but i will try and buy i store from now on
neutral	i ' d ' like ' a refund , and may well pursue this with ' aferry ', unless of

positive	i got a delivery a few_days_later and all arrived in one package , which made it easy to store until i started work .
neutral	all prcing should include the add_ons and hiden costs
positive	i '_ve been to the isle of man many a time before and thought if this is ferrying then you can keep it , but this crossing was super smooth and peaceful .

neutral	i got back to interparcel who ( again ) assured me that the item was scheduled for collection today .
positive	will definitely use again .
positive	i am not a believer these days in brand loyalty as it has_been proven time and again that you get taken_advantage of , so it was good to see that boiler_juice can consistently come up with the best price .

positive	amazing , didn_'_t come_across any_problems , got paid out within 0_days
negative	the scam that has really got me angry this time is arriving to pick_up my car , after paying for everything i wanted on line to be hit with additional_costs of 000_euros ( in case you think this is a typo , you are right one hundred and ninety six euros .)
neutral	thank_you for your prompt service , but i had ordered solpadine max tablets and received solpadine migrane instead .
positive	we were over the moon with what we received as the end product had been made to the highest_standard .
neutral	same with 0 & 0 , sometimes i have people on the phone that are trying very hard , and sometimes they are just rude .
positive	the delivery and customer service were excellent and the rug is exactly_what we have been searching for .
negative	i do not hold serenata responsible but i do blame them for using a company such as yodell for delivering !
negative	paid an extra five_pound for a messed_up delivery and they didn_'_t care when i complained .
positive	this really works - love the site and the products .

positive	top quality products , fast delivery and always well_packaged .
neutral	other than that shopto is great

negative	will use parcelforce in future .
negative	i am very angry and disappointed in this as i would not have spent the money ( that i had to borrow if a family_member ) on replacing the shock absorbers if it was not going to fix the problem .
neutral	product is excellent though - love it !
negative	the phone was reconnected .
negative	never been more angry with a company .
neutral	in my honest_opinion i would not yet recommend this treatment to anyone and i say this because my outcome is not yet known , i am advised that i am_currently undergoing a process of neural adaptation and this could take quite some time as it '_s different for everyone .
neutral	however they issued me a refund for the food , i did ask for a packet to be sent out by they refused for ' logistic reasons '.
negative	does the leg work for her own present !
neutral	i don_'_t think ill use this company as my mother was not happy with the bouquet . i used it as they were the only company who would deliver next_day
neutral	the packing note that came with the delivery implies that the paid for two day delivery had not actually been implemented .
positive	saved time , effort and money .
neutral	odd that when if i go online and go through the process of ordering a new cabinet , it offers me next friday as a named day delivery option if i pay £_00 .
positive	would highly_recommend .
neutral	unfortunately , the six large dusky_pink_roses , outer leaves were tinged with brown .
negative	at same time had email_saying that i could have a refund if i wanted .
negative	as a result i was left without a landline or broadband for 0_weeks until orange could switch me back to my previous provider .
positive	i will buy with supplement_warehouse for many_years to come and i enjoy doing_business with supplement_warehouse !
negative	corruption !
negative	i don_'_t think it is a good product .
neutral	it is no more than a blatant rip_off and taking the consumer as a mug .
negative	and we shall refund it as soon as we get the product back .
positive	the website was easy to use , the prices were very competitive and the ordering very
neutral	however the confirmation of delivery text i received said the flowers at been delivered and left_securely at the front of the property .
positive	postage .
neutral	unfortunately , i am v disappointed and would like to know if you can do something about it .
neutral	i was told it isn_'_t same day and loads of people had also said the same thing i did to them .
negative	why no email , i would have settled for the piano and pedals and waited for the bench to be delivered at a later date .
negative	in short , avoid !
positive	after about 0 - 0 days my order was sent and delivered with out any_issues .
neutral	i called big_dug and they sent them out by royal_mail so i got them the next_day .
negative	maybe its now different with the change in ownership
neutral	when i went into the branch i was unable to get the free warranty as branch charges £_00 so had to go into my car and order the tyres online then back into the depot to have them fitted .
neutral	was very easy to upload and make .
neutral	the delivery was confirmed by text which was fine and standard but as we were not home rather_than leaving with neighbours who were at home our brand_new bags were thrown over the back gate so we came home to a ripped wet nox as it was raining not impressed at all
negative	moral is never believe everything you read especially on the carphonewarehouse website .
positive	madfun arranged for immediate replacement to be sent .
negative	i ordered a chain catcher .
neutral	as a result they could only fit 0 out of the 0 tyres i '_d ordered .
positive	there was communication via_email throughout the process and i received payment the same day , into the account i requested , that mazuma ackknowledged receipt of my phone .
negative	my advice is put your key in and scroll_through the options it will tell you if there is any debt and how much they are taking a week !!!!!!!!
negative	0 to 00 days to refund me ?
positive	good range of all things wine related , finding some reasonably_priced plastic bottle neck tags also a small decanter amusingly shaped like something that picasso might have designed - quite functional too
neutral	easy to book online and good level of cover for quote but i haven_'_t received my insurance pack that i paid_extra for , so now got to arrange to get it printed out somehow as i haven_'_t got a printer at home .
positive	great service arrived quickly . no more flebees !
positive	thank_you !
neutral	i know they have to make money but i know for a fact the expired stuff is pure profit and the shipping charges are the real shot in the dark .
positive	the website was really easy to use and delivery company were fab .
neutral	mrs . v barnes
neutral	when i initially placed the order online i was given dates when deliveries would be in my area .
negative	in the meantime i continue paying my monthly_bill .
negative	for the rest of us , this is not exactly ideal .
neutral	but . the website is just so hard to use .
positive	great service and just what i wanted .
neutral	help men to unwrap it which included lifting to remove cardboard from underneath . their reply was ' oh no love we just deliver !'
positive	i also just recently found them on facebook .
neutral	however once fully_assembled it looks ok , just not as real as it looks in the picture .
neutral	reckon they should be active opt in rather_than passive .
positive	they are an underestimated asset as they brighten_up the day for so many people .
negative	on this occasion i had decided that it would be easier to rent a car and not rely_on trains etc .
positive	delighted !!
neutral	search is ok , but once you '_ve narrowed it down you ' re presented with a series of non - human - readable codes instead of meaningful product descriptions so have to keep clicking to the item to see what it really is .
negative	i thought i would chance it with wowcher hoping that they were a better company but it appears not .
positive	we were amazed our order arrived so quickly .
neutral	asked what was available and were told that only breakfast items were available .
neutral	it would have been much more efficient and cheaper for a very small item to be sent by post .
positive	took a few minutes to focus with them but then . great !
negative	another 00 - mins past and the mechanic sorting my car walked in and sat down at the desk and started typing .
neutral	the unfair part of the contract in my view is that you have to pay for a full_tank of fuel on collection and , as the desk said , " waste it " before you bring it back .
neutral	i requested compensation from them , rudely rejected .
neutral	love the phone and love orange wednesday but hate the website .
positive	items arrived next working .
neutral	i immediately e_- mailed gadget_grotto informing them that two genie head massagers are missing but i '_ve not received a response .
negative	never again

negative	ordered some shoes for a special_occasion and paid_extra for next_day delivery .
negative	they refused , stating it was medication and thats the end of that .
positive	recommend to my cat friends . reliable service along with free delivery .
positive	would recommend to anyone .
negative	i could have bought a far_superior bouquet from the local_supermarket .
neutral	for this reason during many transactions i have given up and given the items to charity or sold them to music_magpie .
negative	and it was not resolved with a full_refund .
neutral	described as ` magenta ` which is a maroon pink , shocking_pink arrived , so i was disappointed as i had spent valuable time selecting the right colour .
negative	merlin_cycles tell me that it ’_s normal , but anyone with half a clue about bikes knows that to be rubbish .
neutral	have not called for a refund yet so no experience on the customer service that side .
positive	easy to use website . envelope delivered quickly .
positive	it was perfect .
positive	i '_ve_used these_guys before and they always offer brilliant value fares .

neutral	!
positive	very happy with this purchase .

positive	you answered questions i had with a professional attitude .
positive	the print was easy to order and arrived within the stated_timescale ( in time for xmas ).

positive	great website with no_hassle at all easy to get around and the products are also great quality will carry on using this website for my e_- liquids and possibly a new vape set_up .
positive	easy to order , speedy delivery .
negative	appaulling .
negative	he informed me that his manger would not let him order the frame without it being fully paid for , ( i was a bit annoyed that he had not called me but thought ok ) i said i will pay over the phone and he told me he could not take payment over the phone .
neutral	it '_s the following_monday , i '_ve been waiting for my package . or at the very least , updates on it . my tracking_number is p00lmbg
negative	i have asked for compensation and been advised that compensation would not normally be discussed mid - dispute .
neutral	the herbal love potion i ordered came on time , but it didn_'_t do what is said on the label , so i was disappointed .
positive	simon
negative	tried to sell eurovision tickets .
positive	very quick service and prompt delivery . would recommend .
negative	i used the website to just arrange_collection rather_than have another failed delivery .
neutral	but op itself no problem over before you know
positive	once again , i have been back to ultralightoutdoorgear as they simply offer the best price and the best service for what i was looking for .
positive	i love my fitflops , got them at a really great price next time i '_m looking for some new shoes , i '_ll check out shoetique .
neutral	was suppose to be hear yesterday and still isn_'_t here .
negative	ordered the bluebud 0inch tablet for a christmas_present , it has never arrived .
positive	went online to find a wipermotor for my audi_a0 , fast service from thes guys
negative	i tried to order some items on the website .
neutral	!
negative	it is now proven the link between carbon emissions and global warming yet your fuel policies actively encourage people to use more fuel than they need , you will frequently hear the phrase “ we might as well drive as we have paid for the fuel ” how can you sleep at night knowing you are contributing to the death of the planet just so you can dishonestly make a few extra pounds , do you not have any corporate responsibility at all .
neutral	goods arrive very quickly .
negative	i emailed wowcher two_weeks_ago asking how i go about chasing my goods , but no reply .
negative	description : my sage_pay refund request by furniture
negative	they need to know what they are getting themselves into .
negative	there are many letting agencies so please find yourself one with good reviews and avoid this company like the plague .
neutral	the battery is made in china , appeared to be new , was well_packaged and as i '_ve said , so_far so good .
positive	prompt delivery
positive	just what we were looking for
negative	if you say anything bad about them or their products , they will take legal_action .
positive	highly_recommended !
negative	i don_'_t see how my only option legally is to have to wait to get it fixed , which i would no_doubt have to pay for before i got reimbursed , or pay yet again to send it back to them for them to get it fixed .
negative	around lunchtime i rechecked the tracking_information .
neutral	i know you can pay extra to get earlier delivery , but hey being on limited funds and trying to make some ones day i couldn_'_t make paying extra for delivery a priority , but flowers good !
negative	go into store and you are faced with lazy children .

positive	snelle_en vlotte levering
positive	would recommend to anyone_wanting top quality apartments in uk .
positive	the staff at the national centre in orpington were very courteous & professional , an excellant service ( especially the young_man who changed my tyres , everything was done by the book & he was happy to swap my wheels around for me too ).
neutral	i was reassured again they would be delivered before 0pm the following_day by royal_mail .
positive	greenman_bushcraft offered an excellent service .

neutral	the whole_experience was ruined by a rude and obnoxious guide who even claimed to having owned the company !
negative	what '_s the point of using serenata ?
neutral	ordered 0 pair of specs on - line , the system hung and no order acknowledgement was sent .
negative	my contacts still have not arrived which is extremely disappointing as i needed them for today .
positive	i cannot_fault the service i received .
positive	i found the website really easy to use , you only have to upload the prescription ( other_sites i have looked at they want you to scan it in then post it !!!).
neutral	however , when i got into placing the photos on the page and scrolling_through the available photos in my folders , the software would crash .
neutral	i requested that i should be reimbursed with the difference , given that i could have returned the item and bought the cheaper one .
negative	wont_be using you again !
neutral	in fact we waited in sweltering heat for about an_hour before we set off and received exactly the same service as if i had booked the shared shuttle .
negative	the parcel had been incorrectly addressed .
negative	the number posted on the website was confusing and even the us phone company could not understand how to dial it .
neutral	i ordered this product on friday and received it on monday though should have received it on saturday there was a glitch on the website which i was disappointed about and though the product was good and i thought ordering from website was easy i would recommend the website
neutral	when i complained i did get a good response and polite e_- mails , just no shoes .
positive	excellent service .
neutral	or my phone_call to the office listed on the website .
positive	not only did my wonderful surgeon come and spend time before my op with me but my anaesthetist also did .
negative	i urge_people to call ofcom to complain and get a reference_number , then write a letter to talktalk with this reference_number so something can be done .
negative	one shoe , was sent .

positive	i would highly_recommend mazuma , so easy from_start to finish .
negative	so i '_ve been without my vespa for 0_months which is costing me a lot of money as i now have to pay for transport .
neutral	would i use it again ?
positive	was exactly_what i was looking for , ordering was simple and goods despatched very promptly .
negative	i ordered a toothbrush , paid £ 0 for shipping , and 00 days_later i had still not received it .
negative	so i complained to him about receiving the wrong one , and guess_what he says to me ?
positive	great range , everything in stock i ordered , superb delivery service , only tiny downside was the last gardenia sprinkler ( exactly same model ) i bought was made of at_least 00_% metal , new one is all plastic , hope they don , t go same way as hozelock who '_s products are utter garbage
negative	we have sent images of the sink and told they would go to technical_department .

neutral	shopped and found my item but was annoyed at over priced postage also if i payed more they would process my order quicker .
positive	they always seem to have the ones i am looking for and i am always impressed by both the price and the quality of the items .
negative	first and last time i use expedia !
positive	very helpful - they rang me straight back when i '_d rung out of hours .
neutral	often items are resonably_priced when compared with other online stores however the free delivery option is not next_day and can be slow .
neutral	but quantity of flowers poor .
positive	i sent off my old_nokia to mazuma with some reservations as there are some negative_reviews out there .
positive	quality of goods exceeded_expectation .

negative	i can only_assume that ' dan ' has adjusted the screen in some way to delete my comments .
negative	nothing yet .
neutral	food .
negative	next when i email a few_weeks_later get one in return saying end of may .
neutral	the straps need either to be thinner , or have some sort of end on that makes for easier gripping .
negative	i wanted to upgrade to a galaxy 0 but they refused my £ 00pm unless i agreed to pay £_00 cancellation !
positive	items i purchased were delivered quickly i needed to return one item for a bigger_size this part of the transaction went equally trouble_free .
neutral	then to add to the confusion , i was awaiting yet another delivery from amazon via_dpd ( 00000000 ) and no card this time , just sitting here quietly and an email popped up saying nobody was home .
neutral	but then , if there '_s an issue , make_sure that you are relaxed and full of patience before dealing_with them , because their customer service is as cheap is it comes .

positive	!
neutral	i called the actual car_hire company supplying my car , and they amended my booking to be full to full .
neutral	to make an_appointment you have to contact the central call_centre - not the local office - such a pain as they don_'_t have access to the same number of appointments as the branch .
neutral	and it came really quickly so i couldn_'_t_resist trying it on as soon as i could !
negative	they think it is better to hold on to £_000 for dear life , rather_than go out of their way to help someone .
positive	based on this experience i would buy from crampton and moore again .
neutral	i ordered a printer on 0 / 0 / 00 , received the order acknowledgement and patiently_waited for delivery .
neutral	the phone arrived_safely , and i received an_email from fonebank . com informing_me that they had received it . followed_shortly by a second email_confirming that my cashback of 00p would be paid .

neutral	school boy error to make !!!
positive	thank_you
neutral	due to the delivery not being in time for christmas , madfun were good to their word and reimbursed half the original cost .
positive	the website said it was in stock and would be despatched within 00_hours .
neutral	anyway , the flowers arrived via the local postman the next_day in a an over sized box so they had been banging around in the box and of course they had had no water for a few_days and had been in and out of royal_mail warehouses = not a very nice delivery of flowers to a loved one .
positive	!
negative	again and found out nothing , they had no idea if the tv had been dispatched .
positive	:)
neutral	the tickets did arrive last friday ( so two working_days before the day of the concert ), which is still way too close for comfort , especially having been told that they were going to be despatched the previous tuesday .

positive	the lady on the phone was very helpful .
positive	however when the ps0_controller i had bought developed a fault i returned it and got a replacement within days , awesome service .
positive	i would certainly use this site again and would have no_problems recommending it to friends and family .
neutral	i mean , at some point i was even trying to help the rep by login up into my computer and finding flights myself !!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	have not looked at the quality of the product yet , but will assume that they are ok
neutral	prices apear cheaper on comparison_sites but level of protection advertised does not see to tally up with any schemes i found on the companies own web_site .
negative	on the day of the appointment i was 00_minutes late due to an accident on the motorway .
neutral	really pleased with the bar and restaurant areas , enjoyed a good evening_meal and a few drinks .
positive	if you want a good deal with excellent sales and after sales service then buy in confidence from plumbnation .
positive	would defiantly recommend them !
positive	the purchase process was easy and simple , delivery was quick and efficient and the overall functionality of the website was simple yet exactly_what you need .
neutral	very clear and easy to use site with a good selection of personalised goods .
negative	i am on totally the wrong contract for me and cannot down - grade for another 0_months and i was not told that i would start being charged for weekend and evening browsing after the first 0_months !
positive	the error that had been made in the order , by me i hasten to add , was easily_rectified the following_day by a most pleasant_gentleman over the phone .
positive	thak you .
positive	he couldnt even get anywhere_near nvc price even with the cheaper model gtc 0 . 0 sport .
neutral	while their turnaround around times are brilliant i would love if they had a option where you could select postage instead of a courier to ship such items .
negative	having made my reservation via the rentalcars website i rang to confirm that i would be able to pick_up my car using a debit_card as i don_'_t travel with a credit_card .
negative	on arrival at the store i was kept waiting 00_minutes whilst staff searched for my sat_nav only to be told eventually that they hadn_'_t got any after all !
negative	i have had a nightmare with this company .
neutral	i ordered these flowers for valentines_day they were good value got on time for the extra money i paid only for some of the roses to be wilted and slightly dead apart_from that i would use this service again if they sort_out that issue .
positive	a member of the team answered quickly to the different questions i had .
positive	with good back up after the sale .
positive	!
neutral	i actually went to see their board to discuss this ; waste of time .
neutral	i bought this jacket for my fiance and am extremely glad i read other reviews and ordered a larger_size than her other jackets , the sizing is definately smaller than elsewhere so take that in consideration and definately order a larger_size than needed for a great fit .
negative	all in all , they have been the worst company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing_with , and certainly never will again .
positive	it turns_out that the postman had left the package in an unusual place , which i found out with an email that was replied to promptly .
neutral	i am so dissapointed and feel that i cannot trust optimax .
positive	good value , good communications and reliable , thanks !
positive	lowest_price , easy to order on website ( no_hidden_charges ) .
neutral	the lights and the transformer are both good , as was the delivery .
negative	they still have not arrived .
neutral	i think the prices and ease of ordering are excellent , but on this occasion the delivery time was far too long and communication from feelgood about the delay took_ages to come through .
neutral	if ordering again would look into paying extra for delivery butthis that then adds to the cost , so maybe i would use a locol florist and would not have been so stressful .
neutral	thanks .
positive	did the usual rounds of amazon / ebay etc and decided to go for the bose_companion 0 series iii .
negative	! oh well they just cut me of !!!
positive	we placed our rental flat with urban_sales and lettings and got an immediate_response .

neutral	excellent service from viovet on placing order and delivery of 0 item out of 0 .
negative	it turns_out that the even this ' after sales ' care is no_longer available - and the company has just walked_away form my botched operation .
negative	i have emailed them asking for a full_refund and still no reply .
neutral	trustworthy mean charging the correct amount on your order , not on the parts you cannot supply , having me phone you , s to get a refund , good job i do internet_banking or i would have had to wait_until i got a bank_statement , the part you sent i recieved next_day were exellent but half a day serching the net got me the main part i needed
positive	dja know wot mate !
neutral	the flowers i ordered were delivered on time and packaged well , but the boquet that arrived was nowhere_near as large as it looks in the photograph on the website .
negative	i will never use this company again and for anyone reading this , if you decide to do so , make_sure you find out if the flowers actually reach their destination .
positive	very impressed , this is how easy ordering should be which in turn will most definitely mean i will order again with absolutely no_hesitation .
neutral	if you were going to design & build your own this should be the end_result & i have an engineering background .
negative	tried worldstores on 00th and told item had arrived at delivery depot .
neutral	i also recently_bought a brand_new snare_drum from them which according to the manufacturers website is supplied with a padded_bag which i didn_'_t get .
neutral	as i couldn_'_t find the colour of shoes for my little_girl anywhere_else i had to purchase another pair ( refund would not be given until wrong_size returned ) and a simple exchange was not an option .
negative	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single_beds ( after requesting a double ).

negative	being an elderly person i suppose i must be old_fashioned .
positive	as stated in header
neutral	a disappointment very speedily righted .

positive	would certainly use again .
positive	great experience and would use again .
negative	b ) despite repeatedly contacting the company , i was not ever advised what had happened to the parcel , i only found out on friday 00th_december , over two_weeks from ordering
negative	why this wasn_'_t done in advance i have no idea .
negative	this is not the case .
positive	i was wrong .
positive	can see bulk_powders taking over maximuscle in popularity .
positive	i keep_coming_back !
negative	infact i stuck my fingers in it and took a photo to post on my facebook to share my experiences with my friends , which prompted them to also reveal they had bad_experiences eating at chiquitos .
positive	excellent communication .
negative	customer service is diabolical , they just repeat themselves until they wear you down .
negative	in summary . worse £ 0 . 00 plus p_&_p ever !
neutral	and finally ….
neutral	i have been loyal to o0 since owning a mobile phone .
negative	poor !!
positive	the heading_says it all !
positive	helpful staff when ordering over the phone , delivery as specified .
negative	i will not be buying from you again
positive	in comparison , they were going to be costly and locked us into being responsible for ongoing maintenance , including the challenge of relocation .
positive	one pair had a small message in the box that they had put anti_reflective coatings on one pair for free !
negative	i '_m sorry but as a customer who has paid for a service and your company has failed to meet my expectations i have a right to complain and share my experiences with others .
negative	took 0 month payment in advance , yet when we left after two years they forgot about that and refused to give us our money back .
neutral	my surgery was fine but i am not squeamish .
neutral	also there was absolutely no mention of £_00 for petrol at the time of purchase .
negative	that was the first detail which didn_'_t impress me .
neutral	not good enough !
negative	as with my previous emails sent , this one has also been ignored .
positive	cheers_guys .
positive	quick and easy to deal with , with a fast turnaround .
negative	you have no chance of getting tickets elsewhere , told viagogo we wanted a full_refund they seemed very reluctant to send confirmation of cancellation .
negative	guess_what , when we returned it the staff could not have been less interested , they said they knew nothing about the problem , it wasn_'_t their problem and tried to omit the compensation .
negative	what a great shame .
neutral	i have placed 0 separate_orders & each order received so far has_been missing at_least 0 envelopes which means i can not post the cards .
positive	amazingly order was reviewed the very next_day and money was transferred an_hour later .
neutral	could have done with more adhesive !
positive	i would have no_hesitation in using blackcircles again and have recommended them to several friends and relatives .
positive	excellent communication , delivery as promised .

negative	!
positive	we had a really good service with this company .
neutral	i have not opened the products - but although they are advertised as original selling pice £_00 . 00 - sale price £_00 . 00 they look cheap - and are much smaller_than they appear as advertised .
positive	got expensive continentals on my vw but managed to save nearly_£_00 a tyre compared to other_suppliers .
positive	the battery was delivered the following_morning well_packaged and fully charged .
positive	very good quality whey_protein and easy to mix with a range of great flavours .

negative	i am awaiting an_apology and a refund at the very least !
positive	i will always prefer to buy online due to the efficiency , fast delivery and cheerful drivers who maintain this no matter_how busy as stressful their jobs must be .
positive	thank_you very much .
neutral	refund for returned sink took a while to appear .
neutral	i want to buy youview through them but they ' re too slow and never ready .
negative	their website should be pulled off the internet by google .
neutral	".
positive	very satisfied customer , who would recommend trophy_store to all .
neutral	i could get a house built in that time !
neutral	that leaves £_000 for deep_sea_fishing that lasted 0 hours and we had to pay to get to .
neutral	i can '_t stop them because my contract wont let_me send stop to the number provided .
neutral	we took 00 family_members of varying ages and found the villa to be spacious and well_equipped overall .
positive	service was excellent , good value glasses , excellent quality .
neutral	flowers that i had delivered looked nothing like what i ordered due to substitution .
neutral	so the tulips festered in a van for 0_days - finally delivered monday_afternoon .
positive	very easy to deal with , excellent coat and swift delivery .
neutral	the only problem came when i received the email_notifying dispatch ; the link to track my parcel didn_'_t work and the order number wasn_'_t recognized so i had no idea when it was going to show up .
positive	kept_informed of expected delivery .
negative	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
negative	!
positive	bundled offers were particularly good value and next_day delivery was just that !
positive	the man bought them right into the house which was very helpful .
negative	despite_being told they had been dispatched , they turned_up 0_weeks_later .
positive	they are a little generous around the heel area but this does not impact on the comfort .
negative	save your money for something edible .
positive	the mountain_equipment crux tee i purchased was the best price i could_find , it was delivered promptly and was well_packaged .
negative	so what a let_down when the delivery company knocked on my door , i happen to live in a flat ( first floor ) just a couple of flights up , i also am partly disabled .
negative	i '_ve had to contact my credit_card company to stop payment .
negative	later in the afternoon i received a text which said my parcel would be delivered between 00 . 00hrs and 00 . 00hrs .
neutral	little_concerned i couldn_'_t get a sample made up but liked the functionality of the website and the ability to adjust change most things on the card .
positive	thanks .
negative	wae_+ will delay refunding for as long as possible .
positive	luckily my parcel had already arrived the following_morning .
neutral	we are really happy with the work and recovery , but think the customer service made it all seem a little weird .
neutral	00 .
neutral	i bought two_pairs of sunglasses .
negative	i told_him i didnt want them and to send me what i ordered , but he wanted me to send the others back first which im not happy with !
positive	i ordered my item on friday and it arrived this afternoon monday - absolutely great service homebase will make_sure i share my experience with anyone who will listen !
negative	i '_ve made many complaints to them , but nothing seems to get done .
neutral	the labels were delivered quickly and look great abut they tend to peel away at the ends and some have come off after washing .
neutral	sent to wrong_address !
negative	the re - arrange_collection facility does not work .
positive	no problem at all with my order , all very easy to set - up the print process .
negative	my other son is 0 .
neutral	ridiculous charges on luggage , of course great if you don_'_t need checked in luggage , but they must know very few people are travelling without anything that can '_t be taken in the cabin .
negative	!
neutral	will probably use them again but follo up with a call to check stock .
neutral	bought honeypot bramble playhouse for my granddaughters - thought it sounded really good - not so .
neutral	was told they would be delivered on 00th_jan but they never turned_up .
negative	i asked for a quote and they took it as i had accepted the policy .
neutral	paid extra £ 0 . 00 for de_luxe service .
neutral	unfortunately , the delivery was a bit of a trauma .
negative	gave them the benefit of the doubt and left it another week .
neutral	i have no_issues with the booking process , however due to the late arrival of the chauffer on my departure i nearly_missed my flight .
positive	easy and pleasant_transaction with easy to follow steps .
positive	we received email notification that the order had been received and again when it was despatched .
negative	the ' safe and secure ' payment website is a nightmare and kept saying payment failed .
neutral	( i . e loss of speech / crossed lines , interference etc : at times the calls just cut of randomly .
negative	i had a really bad_experience , would never use this company again .
negative	when purchasing a brand_new phone , things such as durability cannot possibly be tested and if a touch_screen becomes unresponsive in under 0 months of initial purchase it is up to cpw to prove it was not faulty from point of sale .
negative	lucky he is back on sunday so he can call them .
neutral	slightly frustrating as had to go through booking_procedure twice as first time round the site inexplicably kept saying my card_details not entered correctly , although they were as input them several_times the same and finally had to totally reload site and start again which then accepted them !
positive	product arrived a few_days after ordering and is good quality .
positive	lots of choice , easy to use website .
positive	i placed an order for four items on fri_afternoon and received them all on sat morning .
negative	i '_ve emailed and requested callbacks and no response .
neutral	however , they ought not to be taking orders on items that are not actually available .
positive	the ordering_process was easy and let us see a mock_up of the card / magnet prior to finalising the order .
positive	used twice first for filing_cabinet keys for work second time for window keys for home .
neutral	on the plus_side - after i cancelled the order i was quickly promised a refund to my card if i agreed to reinstate my order - i agreed .
positive	excellent service .
negative	we were very disappointed with flowers we ordered recently for a funeral .
positive	these arrived very quickly and i soon had them working .
neutral	i have been with o0 for a number of years , around about 00 i would say .
positive	for our needs .
neutral	good initial choice of glasses and try at home service , but then had to keep ringing you and when i did i had to have my prescription at hand with date of test - when i did not have it ( at work ) was told that had to have it to discuss with optician , but when insisted that it was only for a discussion about use of varifocal_lens use , the operator reluctantly put me through .
positive	what more could anyone want ?
neutral	it was delivered to a neighbour and put through their letterbox by mistake .
neutral	quote process is good , but once the quote is accepted it gets annoying .
negative	no offer to refund so much as the delivery charge .
negative	ebay has set its self up as the internet policeman , you can buy stuff on the high_street , but not on ebay , you can buy stuff on their foreign websites , but not their uk website
negative	and they took 0 months to reply to this !!!!!
positive	got this table / bench to stand an aquarium on very happy its very well made and super strong .
negative	sent items that had 0 - 0_months on the best before date meaning we have to either reduce them or sell them in bulk .
neutral	why i was not informed when i left my car at the garage that my tyres had no arrived or even a callbefore my appointment enabling_me to postpone my journey would have been good .
positive	ordered it at 00 . 00 am was delivered next_day by 0 . 00 am very helpful on phone when i was ordering
positive	i will never use expedia again .
negative	the police were not impressed .
negative	weeks passed and still no delivery , i had received an email_stating parcel was lost but their tracking stated it was at their distribution_centre awaiting further postal info .
positive	so affordable for the amount you get .
neutral	maybe something slightly better in the way of compensation would have been appreciated !
positive	will use again .
negative	got email_saying sorry this email is late .
negative	rubbish !!!
negative	as i had already waited over 0_weeks to receive my package and was wary of refusing the package i had to pay this ridiculous_amount to get my goods .
neutral	i wanted it there that day , so it was a real_shame it wasn_'_t .
negative	lost times_now of the amount of collections yodel fail to collect .
neutral	some great deals , and real_bargains , some really dodgy places and offers also posted .
negative	they fail to state ( possibly in order to purposefully mislead their customers ) that you cannot return lenses that have been made to your prescription .
positive	i cannot_fault the service , delivery or the product from this company .
positive	would certainly pass the info on with confidence .
positive	what can i say .
positive	really excellent service and i would not_hesitate to do this again
positive	prices .
neutral	i '_m_sure that we are not alone in finding it very hard to purchase from one of the only su [ pliers in britain who will not offer a trade account .
negative	finally after 0 telephone_calls and 0 unanswered_emails and nearly 0 days waiting my points arrive at by midday .
negative	they claimed they had proof and had taken a photograph .
positive	i received it quickly and it was packaged well .
positive	always first_class products and service
neutral	now , once i placed my order my phone actually arrived very quickly which i was pleased about , and i '_m pleased with the phone .
neutral	overall ok but separate companies for 0 men needed as we can '_t all help to lift clobber and i keep having to ask them if there '_s one man or two .
neutral	there were also parts_missing albeit small but had to pruchase these from a d . i . y .
neutral	by that point i was starting to think they hadn_'_t just left the building but they ' d gone to las_vegas to take up residency at caesar '_s palace ( like elvis in 0000 , in case i '_ve lost you ).
neutral	only major downside was perhaps build quality - the finger loop snapped immediately when put on .
negative	!
neutral	i got plenty of emails and texts_letting_me know were and when my orders would be delivered , but they were all mixed up . getting a text saying that the recipient have received their flowers and then an_email_saying they would be sent the next_day .
negative	i immediately contacted shedstore who emailed me the instructions and asked for a photpograph of the damaged felt .
negative	if you continue to take your time in dealing_with this matter appropriately , i shall be contacting_trading_standards .
negative	feel very disappointed and angry .
positive	good suitable packaging .
negative	overall levels of customer communication poor and well below that of the competition .
neutral	when my order arrived poorly_packaged and late from a company i had never_heard of , i wasn_'_t very happy !
negative	have since had to repair to the y - sus board and the upper buffer as the board from flattvparts blew the buffer .
negative	as an update i have now been contacted by jenny bowles by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
positive	we will be back to order others , probably for christmas and or presents
neutral	breakfast was fundamental .
positive	well_done
neutral	stop sending me emails
neutral	it was extremely frustrating and quite hard_work to keep trying .
neutral	fik mine vare efter 0 dage , det jo meget hurtigt .
neutral	£_000 .
positive	got best prices on the market for tools up to the date i '_ve bought a britool socket_set .
negative	( note this was an " extension " to a voucher which initially had no obvious time limit .)
negative	the taxi never showed up and when i called they had no record of this booking - they still took the £_00 from my account even through the taxi never arrived and have not replied to my emails since .
neutral	its unfortunate we had to book late simply because our car had to stay in france until it could be returned home .
negative	i finally told her all i wanted to find out if the items could be delivered sooner .
negative	i find now that many of the deals and available cheaper on amazon , ebay or online .
positive	i asked for some quotes and sent our logo so their designers could render a sample design .
neutral	website is a mess but once you get there it all works quite well .
negative	ruth gibson
negative	having wasted the best part of a week trying to resolve an issue with a company , and being met with disgraceful customer service , i initially left a review on the website of the company in question , but not surprisingly i found that it was hidden from view , whilst many thousands of 0 * reviews were promoted .
positive	made on line shopping so simple to use .
positive	a - 0 place for supplements .
neutral	second time i actually rang to check delivery and was told approx 0_weeks .
negative	i have had enough now , and need advice on what i can do .
positive	very helpful staff .
positive	the medications were so much_cheaper then buying them from my vets ( and that includes the £_00 . 00 i had to pay for each private_prescription ).
negative	but at another , so i drove there . guess_what - yes it was at the original depo . i have to drive all the way back again . even the staff at yodel said their service was awful !
negative	i am taking this matter further , ie , bbc_watchdog and other avenues .
neutral	their range of products is vast , including many lines not available off - the - shelf in the main trade warehouses . in all the orders i have placed so_far i have not experienced the usual ' out - of - stock ' issues i get elsewhere , delivery has_been fast and reasonably_priced .
positive	goods ordered and delivered promptly - kept up to date by text of when goods would be delivered .
neutral	- extremely poor reception , call answering and mail service .
neutral	we stayed for a 0 night stay in a family room at feltham - travelodge - london .
positive	just one small error in all the years i have used moonpig and i use them a lot .
negative	i want to know how i will be compensated for this horrific experience – i was told that the customer service would be excellent with utility_warehouse and my family and i have been scarred by this experience .
neutral	the ham was opened when i received it and smelling quite badly .
neutral	however i didnt receive any tracking at all for my item until 00_hours after it had been delivered .
neutral	the glasses i received were terrible , the lens popped out after a week , they never fitted in the frame properly and the screw fell out a week_later .
neutral	so good product ruined by poor sales_techniques and company strategy .
positive	ordered just after lunch on friday .
negative	rubbish
neutral	i was impressed by the speediness of my purchase , however , i ordered the same size jacket that my father already has but in a different colour - but for some reason it came up very small .
negative	and just to put the cherry on the cake he left a 0x0 foot pallet in the front driveway
neutral	i chose the option to use english when i ordered the flowers , so it must have been obvious that i was an english speaker
positive	got them in sale too which was an added_bonus
neutral	surely zen_bedrooms realise that the many negative_comments about their delivery system reflects very badly on them ?
negative	my phone was stolen , so of course i asked them to cancel the sim and send a replacement .
neutral	secondly the double hook is too small for winding the drawstring onto and should be higher quality for the price - brass or stainless_steel .
neutral	in total i paid £_000 . 00 for tickets with a total face value of £_000
negative	awful service !
neutral	iv been using play for some time and watched it grow and grow it used to be excellent but now its just mediocre really delivery issues aplenty and call_centers that are difficult to get through to , an ever_expanding range of goods to choose from , one word of caution if you buy an item and it gets lost in our great postal_system you have to wait two full weeks before you can report it to play as lost .
neutral	as the system is automated , there was no way they could prioritise my order from the normal 0 - 0 working_days , even if the fact i couldn_'_t place the order was jessops ' fault .
negative	all i vaguely remember is that it wasn_'_t good for people who work " normal " office hours - if i didnt work office hours i '_d probably have been in to sign for my parcel .
negative	!
positive	i ordered it on thursday and it came on friday .
positive	excellent price for the shower and delivery experience was as promised .
positive	about gluten_free dietry requirements , vegetarian , whether the chalet has unlimited wine ( yeah im a student )
negative	please do not use this company !
neutral	i ended_up having to chase the order when it didn_'_t arrive 0_days_later thinking that it had been delivered to the wrong_address .
positive	most_important fact is that i was kept_informed continuously of the progress regarding my annuity in plain_english .
positive	we have just had an expensive carpet fitted in the hall .
positive	has never_failed to get whatever we want , whenever we want it to wherever or whoever we want to get it to .
neutral	night flights into nice are a gamble - at midnight precisely everyone goes home .
neutral	i booked 00 / 00 0000 to 00 / 00 0000 and i meant to book 00 / 00 0000 to 00 / 00 0000 making this mistake cost me a £ 0 admin_fee , which i thought was very unreasonable
negative	they refused stating that they were to value according to the florist .
neutral	the delivery times can be a bit hit and miss . good varity of books and reasonable_prices saves the day ,
neutral	i bought 0kg premium protein pro xl last_week . cannot see any difference . im a beginner who started weight_training 0_weeks_ago . i ll comment on what the taste , texture , quality is like below .
positive	service you would hope for
negative	i had to ask for my money to be refunded from this company who
neutral	delivery was late and measurement info was not accurate as medium was a bit on the . small side , could have done with the large .
negative	what a disappointment .
neutral	i upgraded to the middle price bracket and still only received 0 flowers .
negative	i can see this is the case with many other negative_reviews and agree with the review who said nigel_o ' hara do not want people to know the truth about their poor service .
negative	bad customer_services , my score would be 0 / 00 .
positive	and a nice present of a highlighter !
positive	my favourite things about hb though , was that in my confirmation_email they provided information on the best way to get to / from the airport to / from the hostel - which is second to none , we otherwise would have ended_up forking_out for a taxi and paying way over the odds !
negative	what use is this to me , seems like another cheap imitation which don_'_t work , should have just paid the premium and gone to straight to apple
negative	they eventually responded to say that they had managed to find the address ( how , all of a sudden ?)
positive	it was packaged well and delivered exactly when i wanted it .
positive	and it '_s not always because they are the cheapest .
positive	although she says she_sees an improvement in my condition ).
negative	dont use viagogo .
neutral	my order was placed and the money debited from my account but it took two_weeks to arrive !
negative	i wanted a canvas picture for my oh '_s christmas_present , and wowcher had a promo for just this .
neutral	placed an order for 0 pairs of shoes .
positive	it was such an easy thing to arrange .
positive	i would recommend cyclestore without_hesitation .
negative	theres no shame in not memorising recommended tyre_pressures for every car in the world right .?
neutral	one item wasn_'_t delivered , i left an answer phone message , nobody returned my call .
negative	help
neutral	everyone seemed to be having a nice time and the bands , although not to my taste at all , were free after all and quite entertaining .
positive	if you shop else where you are missing out .
negative	do not order from this company .
positive	i would highly_recommend hatchbag for an excellent all_round service and product .
neutral	but i was disappointed with the quality of the stickers -- they are very thin so the corners tend to roll under or fold over when we are applying them .

negative	awful company
neutral	throughout his dealings with us the only thing he became animated about was talking_about his daughter .
negative	nearly a year on i am still being chased by them highlighting small_print in their t + c '_s and threatening even larger bills .
positive	they were easy to install and look really good - great price too !
neutral	unfortunately i don_'_t think i will be using you again
neutral	now i have finished this report at their request i cant post it without accepting " trustpilot & partners using cookies for stats , social_media and marketing , meaning i will prob now be bombarded with unsolicitated mail and spam !
neutral	i was very pleased with the quality of the furniture but was disappointed that the delivery drivers did not unpack the sideboard and take the rubbish away .
neutral	what i will say is that the helpdesk staff in india ( at_least i presume in india ?)
neutral	but all '_s well that ends well and thank_you .
positive	i found this site really easy to use
positive	i would definately recommend this firm ,
neutral	very disappointing
positive	!
negative	when the chark line came it looked but the line is a bit hard to pull out and its a bit hard to reel in i have been working with chark lines for 00 years and this one is not right
negative	i have made a request for special pleading in this case - we shall see what happens .

positive	nothing but a good experience - will_definitely be using blackcircles again .
positive	.
positive	great communication with the company and i '_m pretty sure i will get back to them :)
positive	i rang the company as_opposed to ordering on the net .
negative	great after sales .
negative	they offered me the old_iphone , 00bg and wanted to charge me £_000 . i think that this is outrageous to treat loyal_customers like this , when my daughter went and got the brand_new iphone on her very low contract for practically nothing !
positive	therefore he needed to look smart and professional !
positive	the service was spot on .
negative	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
neutral	so , not only do i feel as though you have lied to me about the delivery ( i assume the florist clicked " delivered " to improve their stats with your site ), i also feel as though your support person was rude when i tried to follow_up .
positive	when filling out the booking form for coming_back i guessed the time as couldnt be_bothered to look and the guys informed me the correct time within 00 seconds at checking in the car .
positive	the procedure sounds much worse_than it actually is and although daunting was completely pain_free .
negative	not even an_apology mr bozowi ?!
neutral	i have 0 grievances - 0 is i can never get through on the telephone if i wish to speak to someone personally .
neutral	so i emailed myprotein to ask what was going on .
neutral	emailed superdry customer service to let them know ( 00th_dec ) and request a replacement immediately as this was required for an xmas_present , and to date i have received no goods and had no reply !!
negative	boohoo . com were very nice and gave_me 00_% of the next order but i feel it was not their fault it was the fault of the courier and this could end up jeopardising boohoo '_s reputation .
negative	bravofly is issuing me a voucher in order to be able to use it for my next purchase .
negative	00 hr later my money was still not paid to the recipient due to reasons which were opposite of what i was told the previous day .
positive	i used thesignbuilder as it had a design it yourself section which i found intuitive and quite easy to use .
neutral	cleans main floor areas but useless for corners .
negative	( they are continuing to sell this product online ).
negative	when bad firms consistenly act in such an uncaring way they do not realise the disappointment and frustration they bring on customers and recipients .
neutral	dick turpin at_least wore a mask .
neutral	!
neutral	my parcel was delivered very speedily , but after ringing the doorbell on our three - storey house , the delvery driver hardly gave my husband any time to get down the two flights of stairs from the top floor ( which he did immediately on hearing the doorbell ) before he had taken the parcel to a neighbour '_s house .
neutral	also bars not good , nasty texture .
negative	the good news is that when i did get to talk to someone they refunded all the extra_insurance i had paid and added 0 %.
negative	i sent them back the same day .
negative	riddiculous !
neutral	my main criticism is that the centre of the pages do not flow into each other as they used to and you can loose some of the picture because of this .
positive	we are getting out little_girl christened april / may next year and i will be ordering cards and stationery from optimalprint for that .
negative	the flowers arrived in a box . containing the flowers and the vase separately .
positive	also a very quick service .
positive	excellent customer service .
positive	and the delivery service was also excellent .
neutral	i had the money in 0 accounts , so would '_ve had to go back to terminal and atm '_s to fix this , but then the desk_clerk ' wangled ' it and i only had to pay in r0000 .
neutral	how wrong was i ?
neutral	usually the quality is excellent , though not always the best priced one !
positive	just an_absolute_pleasure .
neutral	i had some stuff to sell .
positive	well_done viovet , i '_m well impressed !
neutral	eventually said they maybe noy 000_% fresh and just bit dull looking .
positive	delivery information was excellent .
neutral	it '_s a good cabin - now .
negative	now , let_me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
neutral	called only to find answer phone so left voicemail and emailed , neither were returned .
negative	so a repair of a screen ( which retails at £_00 by the way ) has cost us £_000 .
neutral	either way , i '_m not particularly tempted to use topcashback again & wouldn_'_t recommend it .
positive	the debited my account with the agreed_amount the day they received the phone .
neutral	the delivery company did nor delver when they said they would .

positive	seamless from_start to finish , payment was quick and i got more than i was quoted by their_competitors !
positive	i got great advice from the online tech_support and from the forum .
neutral	very good but small price !
positive	i would recommend chain_reaction cycles for their prompt service and reasonable pricing .
neutral	when the cushions did arrive they were lovely and worth the wait .

negative	!
negative	i '_ve been in tears trying to explain that it '_s not my fault .
positive	x
positive	they keep their costs to a minimum , which helps our profit_margins .
negative	this amount also took my account overdrawn ( something that never happens ) but they refuse to compensate for my bank charges .
negative	none of the lines answer and all go to a dead tone .
positive	whenever i call support , they ' re always very accommodating .
negative	luckily i paid with paypal so was able to open a claim .
neutral	i wasn_'_t prepared to be clamped down with a big contraption attached to my eye ball - no one had explained that to me .
negative	spent absolute ages on the phone to their customer_services ( several_times ).
positive	i '_ve now used the physioroom twice and have received great service on each_occasion .
negative	stressful and rubbish .
neutral	i was with 0 for a couple of years and at first seemed ok although the coverage wasn_'_t that great and i was supposed to receive a 0g_signal everywhere around me but i didn_'_t .
positive	a text arrived the next_morning to let_me know a delivery time , and it was there when it said it would be .
positive	i had no problem ordering and taking_advantage of various offers and additional products .
neutral	the desk advised this always happens & is unclear .
neutral	my order arrived today , packaged well .
neutral	plus_side was that i had a voucher so didn_'_t cost a lot .
neutral	however , when the items were delivered i think that all the packaging should be taken_away .
neutral	i order , i pay , its despatched and its delivered and then only when i decide to receive it .
positive	used these_guys for a wetsuit and surfboard online .

positive	their international_shipping is fairly quick , and overall i have no_complaints .
neutral	this was a one off occasion and i was pleased to see the show , however the mark - up price made it a very expensive night out especially with all additional_charges and postage .
positive	the trees were delivered quickly , safely and in perfect_condition .
positive	i would definitely buy from them again !
negative	i followed the automated_system for collection .
negative	before i bought their product i emailed them to ask if their product would clear the botnet my system was infected with , i never had a reply to that simple question , i should have known better , i bought it !!!!!!!!!

neutral	watch was delivered in super quick time .
positive	i ordered the bouquet on thursday_evening and it was delivered on friday_morning .
neutral	i think if you unpacked and assembled then i would rate this as a 0_star experience .
negative	we are waiting for stereophonic tickets for the assembly rooms derby this monday_00rd .
neutral	this was followed_by a succession of emails and text_messages which was completely unnecessary - we only needed to be told once .
neutral	lucky for us we had booked to stay a night otherwise our mini_cruise would have consisted of an_hour and a half in amsterdam which would have been a complete_waste of money .
neutral	the customer service lady then said it would definately be delivered the next_day ( saturday ), to which nothing arrived .
neutral	no_problems at all with the website and products .

positive	as a bonus , the price was the lowest we found .
neutral	got the job_done , as best as i can tell .
neutral	it '_s not immediately apparent but noticeable when you look properly .
neutral	the instructions suggest that i should have also received some fitments to hold the cover for the top of the blind and i was certainly going to need to fit the cover to hide the worn looking brackets .
positive	my only extra_cost was postage for returning the wrongly ordered item ,
negative	they have assured me i will get my money and they will get it back fro se .

neutral	si tout_ceci devait s ' éterniser , nous_avons trouvé un moyen de_faire appel à différentes instances ( avec juristes , etc .) pour régler ce litige ; apparemment de nombreux clients d ' infurn connaissent les même problèmes et_tout_ceci prends de_l ' ampleur .

negative	if your staff is not taking their job seriously , its time to get new ones because they are destroying your reputation .

neutral	fortunately my father saw the van and collected the flowers but if he had not they could have been there all day as my parents tend to use the backdoor when coming and going .
negative	don_'_t just take this review '_s word for it do a double_check on the manufacturers name and check out the grief .
negative	you can sometimes buy in their shop products in good prices , that is the reason i bought from them my seagate 0tb green , the disc failed after few_months , and when you try to contact them they made up senseless excuses , they don_'_t even talk correct sentences just senseless words which you later put_together as meaning '' no sorry '' there is no warranty talk with manufacturer .

positive	i can '_t think of anything bad to say at all , which for a car_hire firm is high praise !

neutral	my first and last order with animed .
negative	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
negative	i emailed them and i finally got a reply reporting that they had a larger then expected order , but this does not make it acceptable to get a customer to wait 0_months for a simple beanbag .

neutral	job and totaly restored my faith in o . f . l .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i had to miss my granddaughter '_s drama show to catch the delivery man .
negative	just after three or four uses , i thought i should get it checked since it was under_warranty .
positive	waistcoat looked better_than the page image .
neutral	this part of the service really put me off and if it wasn_'_t for another company not being_able to match the deal i wanted i would have gone_elsewhere !
neutral	better_bathrooms need to improve their own internal quality standard checks ( see below ) prior to dispatching goods and not place the oneous on their customer .

negative	in all day as well .
neutral	delivery prompt but incorrect order as rather_than including the birthday card selected and paid for a sorry card was delivered and sorry written all over the box took the shine off the gift and left my elderly_mother confused .
neutral	if you are interested in our own services , we would be happy to have a chat - contact generateuk at 00000_000000 .

neutral	which i did .
positive	would use again .

neutral	as usual , the clerk handling the prior conditions assessment was not technically expert , just filling in a form , and it was hard to work out the logic of the form – if a condition had been corrected by treatment it was sometimes regarded as a continuing risk and sometimes not – so it wasn_'_t easy to make_sure that you were making a full disclosure , and i wasn_'_t sure at the end of it whether i was actually being charged more than once for the same condition .

neutral	the customer service team via_email were great .
negative	be - careful .
positive	it was delivered the following wednesday in a time_slot that suited me and i am really pleased with the furniture .
positive	it also stops nosey neighbours and so called friends wasting time by viewing for their own curiousness .
neutral	think that they should do more earliey travel deals , with discouts , at good hotels .
neutral	lovely pink bed_frame , mattress is top quality memory_foam , bed easy to put_together , wooden_slats are poor quality , thin & slip out far too easily from the black plastic caps that fit into bed_frame .

positive	!
negative	reason ?

negative	i received an_email notification stating that the flowers had been delivered .
neutral	prices for some products higher than same products in supermarkets
positive	would use this company without_hesitation again .

neutral	i then went of to purchase 0 similar pairs of diesel trainers , this time made of canvas .
negative	i had problems booking a hotel online . ended_up with 0 hotel_bookings for the same dates .
neutral	the parcel took a long time to arrive .
positive	shipping was as stated and i received the package long before i expected to .

neutral	that morning i phoned the 00000000000 and had to wait 00 minuets , i was told the delivery would be with me between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .

positive	communication via_email was excellent , delivery dates and times were kept to with well named staff delivering the items to our home .

negative	i can recommend carhire0000 , they went out of there way to help me .
neutral	the prices are still veery competative though .
negative	from booking , when i had problems using a discount_voucher , to delivery the whole_process was very disorganised .
negative	update . to be fair the refund was very quick . a word of advice to buydirect .

positive	so , i just transferred all my carts and wishlist over to juno download which i previously and for maybe 0 - 0 years , only used for 00 " purchases .
neutral	i enquired as it had been a few_days if the parcel had been sent the parcel was sent out that day and was received quickly but found when i opened it that another two products were not included presents i had been counting on two_sets of astronauts so although the games we did receive were great we did have a bit of a disapointment but hopefully we wont have this next time we decide to buy .
negative	the company now want me to return it at my expense and are taking no responsibility for any part they played in this error
neutral	i ordered some flowers for mothers_day , to be delivered on the sunday as the website says guaranteed delivery on mothers_day , which is the only_reason i went with this company as my mother works everyday apart_from sunday so i knew she would be home to collect them .

negative	all arraged or so we thought as both packages arrived the following_morning at 00 . 00 , very luckly i was just about to leave for work so i got them inside .
negative	the time delays have been ridiculous but the worst thing about dealing_with the company has_been the constant_emails and phone_calls i have had to make to get my order processed .
negative	again no delivery and i received no phone_call .
positive	until everything is signed sealed and delivered i can '_t fully comment .
negative	they are not acknowledging my request for a cancellation at all .
positive	posted out rapidly and received safely - what more could their clients want ( other than gripe above ).
negative	these_guys are scam_artists !

positive	i '_d definitely use them again with confidence .
negative	due to a system admin_error the parcel wasn_'_t collected on the saturday and since then the support has_been diabolical .
negative	the opperations manager was quite patronising and offered no more than a credit_note .
neutral	they were good enough to say they would refund the money i had paid , but how do i get a bulb that will fit the fridge ?
neutral	bought sage software .
positive	i always look there first .
negative	it doesn_'_t make_sense , it also makes the book look totally unfinished .
neutral	still_waiting .
neutral	however , order reference_number which was emailed to me so that i could track the delivery was incorrect so i had to guess when it would be delivered .
positive	service was excellent - i even got an e_- mail back from the md explaining how i could return them ( postage refunded ) if they turned_out to be the wrong type .
negative	they don_'_t answer emails and rarely answer the phone - when they do it '_s promises but no action .
positive	again - i apologise for ever considering the clunky , sticky , technological hand grenade of a site that is beatport .
positive	they were left where i recommended as the recipient wasn_'_t in !
neutral	i find your web - site design poor by comparison with other_sites .
positive	i was able to give him my tyre sizes , etc .

negative	!
positive	i '_d recommend them to anyone looking to book !
neutral	not a good way for a company to work .
neutral	very good way looking for holiday , lots of choice and informative , except the hotel booking did not mention if breakfast was included on special_offer .

neutral	web_site easy to navigate
neutral	i will now be ringing to get my money back for goods that i haven_'_t received .
neutral	we had to get flights home the cheapest and quickest way possible .
negative	i then asked to speak to a manager at which i was told he would give £_00 worth of e_- vouchers to take off this order we were due , as he had put the order through once again of his system between 0 - 00am the following_morning .
negative	as we needed the tiles quickly - which is why we placed the order for a tile that was ' in stock ', we had to cancel the complete order and go elsewhere .

neutral	i will use this site again but only if i am not able to buy elswere , for such a very small item eye_drops 00mls i feel that to pay the same for the postage as you do for the drops is a bit_steep , it is a shame as i would used the site more . apart_from that it was good
neutral	my order wasn_'_t actually in stock but this wasn_'_t indicated on the site .

positive	the home care range is great especially the reed difusers - they are so much_cheaper then in the department_stores .
neutral	the order tracking_link sent from snowinn for the gls site did not work ; you have to enter your snowinn order number into the gls tracking site and search for your order in the list .
positive	i was very impressed with both the products themselves and the site .
neutral	when the cover arrived it had good finish but creaked ever so slightly and it basically fell_apart within a week ( the first chips appeared on the first day ) and this was not through neglect and maltreatment - it was just day - to - day use .

neutral	solution : put bean sacs inside plastic bin liner to enter them into cover .
neutral	good price and helpful staff however delivery was supposed to be on 0 / 0 and for some reason was arranged on 0 / 0 .
neutral	recently ordered a print , which came out fine but disappointingly was just packages in a paper and flimsy_plastic back .
positive	used several_times , speedy & faultless service combined with great value = one happy customer
negative	customer service is unknown to this company and after 00 years with them i have had enough .
positive	my friends could not believe it was not a commercial book .
neutral	i ordered the flowers to be sent to my son & his partner in celebration of the birth of my first_grandchild , i ordered them friday_lunchtime and asked for them to be delivered saturday_morning as they had not come home from the hospital .

negative	i would not recommend this company !
positive	what more do you need ?
neutral	however they did put chocs in . have nt heard from lady_who received them so don_'_t no if flowers were nice . when i orderd flower and put card_details in didn_'_t like that all my card_details were on show and not black dots .
neutral	however , i find the website extraordinarily slow to navigate , much_easier to telephone and speak to one of the charming staff .
neutral	i totally refused to do this and subsequently told to calm down by the operator .
negative	horrible dire faced woman .
negative	communicating via_email when i want tp talk through best options / how to best avoid issues is not really customer friendly
positive	would definitely recommend !
negative	bottom line they acted like they were doing me a favour by refunding my card 00_% unbelievable !!!
positive	i won_'_t buy from anywhere_else - it would be simple vanity to go out and spend silly money to complete simple everyday tasks like sending e_- mails and working a crm system .
neutral	along with a bottle of body_wash instead of the conditioner .
positive	try them i am sure you will not be disappointed .
positive	we were sick of asking clients to slow down , sounding like a broken record .
negative	with all this in mind , if you do still decide to go_ahead and buy , then my only advice is this - make the delivery staff wait_until you have checked every inch of your sofa / s , sit on all the seats , work all the mechanisms , check all the fabric / leather , they won_'_t like it but do not be hurried .
neutral	i really like the edit of clothes - with designers you don_'_t see on other_websites .

positive	selecting the correct specs was simple , cost was fair for my needs , i made a small mistake when entering prescription which was picked_up by select_specs and made good .
positive	products arrive in good condition and more often than not , earlier_than_expected .
neutral	when i rocked up to collect the car , i was told that if i wanted real insurance it would cost an additional 00 euro a day and that what i had purchased was some kinda insurance against the excess ( whatever that means ) . the rental_car company then blocked off 0000_euro of my credit_card ( apparently this is the excess ). i '_ve rented lots of cars in dublin and normally they block off between 000 - 000_euro .

neutral	both products ok but had a couple of issues which are still_unresolved .
positive	great value .

negative	customer_care ?
negative	instant_response from paypal stating the money had left my account .
negative	the order was delivered on friday and i would have expected some response now .

negative	not happy
negative	received the confirmation_email_stating that it was booked .
neutral	had amazing vision in my right eye and my left eye was only ok , but my combined vision was good .
negative	completely_incompetent and unreliable !
neutral	also my last sailing was very late , no explaination or regrets .
negative	however , they do say you can only judge a company when there is a problem and this time there has_been which hasn_'_t been resolved and i '_m not sure how it will be as they don_'_t respond or do what they say .
neutral	in a speedy manner .
positive	totally faultless .
negative	although our butler in the buff ( christian ) arrived and cheered everyone up from the shock of the shed / barn he was wonderful i '_d say best part of the hen_weekend .

neutral	the online site is perfect .
negative	i will now have to find another store in brighton to do this for me , which will probably cost me more money .
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy that the process to book via mobile phone app was quite troublesome and i had to try about 0 times before it accepted my payment ( it didn_'_t like paypal ) and since i was using a small screen ( i was unable to apply the discount_code on my laptop ) i didn_'_t notice some of the ' optional_extras ' that got automatically_added before confirming payment .

negative	?
negative	rubbish .
positive	- you send them phone .

neutral	i appreciate that we placed our order over the christmas_period and delivery times would differ but all one needed was to be kept inform .

positive	i just love it , a bedroom to be proud of .
positive	i used professional photos and had a floor_plan drawn up as part of the package .

negative	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail_stating that they had delivered my parcel which they clearly hadn_'_t because i had seen them drive off with no attempt at delivering the package .

positive	the reminder section for reordering is brilliant i have never been with out my lenses at all .
positive	perfect
negative	the seller is now claiming to have delivered the item , when you can see from his email below that that he had already accepted that was not the case !)
negative	i was only advised this when i enquired .
positive	thank_you toolstop for a great service .
negative	half an_hour later i had an_email_telling_me that the order had been dispatched .
negative	well , surely the customer is always right ?
positive	the blinds i '_ve had from blinds0go have been excellent in the past , hence my further orders .

neutral	i had to send them back again .
negative	do they exist ?
positive	reasonable prices too
negative	i will make a point of making_sure everyone_knows_how this fake company deals with honest customers .
negative	their 0 - midnight uk number does '_t work at 00 : 00 neither does their french one .
neutral	good product for the money , i required it for going to appointments instead of getting a taxi , perfect weight and size for travel .
positive	very good website easy to navigate around to find the perfect eye_wear .
neutral	had a problem when checking out ( no where to enter promo_codes ; order got split so no free delivery ).
positive	i have no_hesitation in reccommending their services and would suggest that anyone about to buy an annuity would be well advised to contact them to see what they can offer .
positive	cash in my bank_account a couple of days_later .
neutral	although this time we only had 0 enquiries , none of which rentify called us about the only way i found out about them was calling and chasing all three occasions they didn_'_t know why i had not been called about them .
positive	snelle service , perfect
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone looking for oak_furniture .
negative	what infuriates almost as much as your contempt for your customers and your clear determination to rip each and every one off as much as possible , is your contempt for the planet we live on .
positive	got what i ordered .
positive	excellent services from_start to finnish .
negative	i contacted the salon and arranged an_appointment for a consultation , which i attended .
negative	whilst pleased with the online ordering_process , my wife was very disappointed when she opened the box_containing the flowers .

neutral	me and my partner have used the same ear_plugs for years - we received a batch that were hurtin out ears so complained about them and received a refund - we wud have bn happy with a replacement but this was not an option !
neutral	so i now have cupboards full of boxes rather_than use my stylish worktop display stand !
negative	i have been trying to escalate my complaint within the company , and despite_emailing and calling on several_occasions i am just ignored .
neutral	then there are the frequent competitions , which are fun , the prizes often being free calls - which are always welcome .

negative	run away and find an other company , there are so many !
positive	easy to use website with great prices and quick delivery .
negative	i have spoken to over 00 people over these days with each one promising me that the driver was on his way .
positive	as title , once the catalogue is figured out , really a good source of electronic / electrical items .
negative	on tuesday the 00th_august i noticed £_00 had been taken out of my account by avis .
negative	all we can do is keep our fingers_crossed that the ticket is on its way and that you are behaving honourably .
positive	prices are again very good but even if they are a little more_expensive i purchase from them for the good service that i receive .

negative	but the getting the refund was a nightmare !
positive	excellent from_start to finish .
negative	terrible to non - existant service .
neutral	they do a good job of making_sure their frequent customers get priority on waitlists .
neutral	we got there at about 0 . 00pm only to be find no queue and the club not opening until 00pm , so we hung around like a load of desparados !
negative	0 - 0 roses with some cheap filler , the recipient was not impressed either !
negative	so i contact customer_services again and now they tell me that one item only is in stock and that the other item is now due 00 - sep !
neutral	not great customer service , so i may look_elsewhere in future .
positive	will wear them in an evening to dress up my outfits .
negative	i rang the helpline immediately but was told that once you have ordered on line no changes could be made .
neutral	the website allows you to create an account but there is no functionality yet but it is coming apparently so that will be great because it '_s very hard to contact the company by phone ( engaged_tone for hours at some times of day , i guess it just gets busy ).
negative	but of course , one does not simply go and collect a parcel from yodel .
neutral	flowers arrived at approx_0pm which was acceptable .
negative	they have now cost me an additional £_00 in credit_card fees as i believed that the balance would have disappeared with the refund !
positive	great service , best price , delivered bang on time will_definitely use again

neutral	then had to order 0 replacement hinges for fridge .

neutral	sadly we had to go to the royal_mail delivery office to collect them , even_though we had given instructions to leave outside if no reply .
positive	great efficient customer service , very quick delivery , product as expected .
neutral	flavours :
negative	i applied to open a business bank_account at the same time but did not receive any details and the company did not reply to any email communications .
neutral	don_'_t save with them .
negative	aol '_s service continues to be execrable .
negative	emailed again monday - no reply and chased it up thursday - no reply .
positive	as always , perfect goods , perfect delivery
negative	would you believe it , two_days_later i got an email_saying that the money was no_longer in their account , but depending on how long barclays took to process the payment , was how long before i would see it on my statement .
positive	im very impressed with the way this works .
neutral	unfortunately , the large 0ft dracula that was sent was ripped at the back and therefore did not stand properly for the party .
positive	best place to online there fast and quite reasonably_priced to .
negative	thank_you for choosing expedia . co . uk
positive	i hope that she lost several pounds doing this !
positive	have used matt several_times and never been disappointed - fast efficient service every time - smooth and easy - just the way a transaction should go
negative	the prices offered are very competitive but items they claim are in stock take a long time to arrive - fine as long as you are aware of this beforehand .
negative	i want to listen to the acts they should be heard .
positive	sometimes i would only receive half of my prescription because of local shortages ( like when hay_fever season_starts ) and have to go back a couple of days_later ( another 0 miles ).
neutral	it '_s probably a great service .
positive	excellent range & matching customer service
negative	i have complained to yodel .
neutral	!

positive	the quality of the frames were fantastic and one pair were better quality than a £_000_+ pair he had recently_purchased at a local_opticians .
neutral	just received my 0nd parcel ( 0st being fantastic ), this time though it has_been quite poor .
neutral	great quality products .
neutral	the quality of the goods were fine but they did come flat packed so you have to put them together .
neutral	i just have a bit complain_about the information they gave on their website about a model of contact_lenses , that wasn_'_t completely right .
negative	arrrrrahhhhhh
negative	i ordered a telephone ( 00pds plus ) which was faulty on delivery - i returned it but have not been paid a refund ( over 00 months now ) despite many requests and reminders - they also trade as sales @ ezstyle . co . uk
positive	the jacket arrived in two_days and was of good quality and properly packed for protection .
neutral	most comparison_sites get paid by the companies who are being reviewed so you can see that this is likely to mean the review is not unbiased which is why more and more companies are not wanting to have anything to do with these kind of sites .
positive	just needed to order a few items to set_up new 000 ltr tank needed a trustworthy company with fast delivery and thats exactly_what i got !!!

neutral	i wanted to buy a guitar .
positive	can '_t wait to test it in warm seas !

neutral	sometimes the website said the pricing couldn_'_t be found , sometimes the particular journey did not appear .

neutral	beds also not the most comfortable , we were all looking_forward to our own beds after 0_weeks .
negative	i even had a comment from goodprint twitter saying my design was fab surely at that point someone could have said ' hey the resolution isn_'_t quite right are you sure you want to continue ?'
neutral	however , the website says these mats are suitable for coupe models 0000 - 0000 ( mine is 0000 ) and the holes in mats to secure them in the footwell are in the wrong place !
positive	i would recommend them to anyone who have had problems obtaining car credit in the past . go for it with can can car finance , no embarrassment guaranteed !
positive	simply_supplements ordering service ; on line or by phone is always excellent .

neutral	very impressed with the service and delivery of the clothing and the quality of the superdry products is excellent .
neutral	the box of flowers were left at my front_door which is at the roadside so anyone could have taken them - they were left vertical and upside_down whereas the box explicitly said store horizontally - most of the flowers were lovely but the central carnations were all dead -
positive	product much_cheaper_than buying from the vet .
negative	i honestly wish i had just bought these sunglasses from a highstreet retailer , and at_least i would know where they had come from , and would have a point of call for any_queries i might have regarding the purchase - for the sake of saving £_00 !
neutral	the local_solicitor contacted me but to date i have not heard any more he was sceptical as to whether a claim could be made but it would have been helpful if he could have finally said it was not possible and not keep me waiting .
positive	in fact , it was cheaper to buy from them and have the goods shipped to me than to buy from a local company selling similar products .
positive	i was recommended by a friend , so i tried it .
neutral	arrived at dublin_airport , to an empty desk , i had to go couple mins ( drive ) down the road to collect the car .
neutral	it was worse_than aeroplane food .
neutral	i had to ship another parcel a few_days_later and went straight to the collect_+ plus website and bypassed myparceldelivery . com .

negative	i was then assured that they would try to get me replacement tickets for hannover , apologised for the email being sent in germand and assured me it would be resent in english and took my mobile number so that they could contact me as soon as they found replacement tickets to change delivery to the hotel in hannover as they would not get to the uk in time .
neutral	none of us like red so this caused a lot of anger and upset , you don_'_t spend £ 0000 on a door willy nilly / we are now stuck with a gross bright_red door for 00 years +
positive	we stayed here for 0_weeks in sept with friends .
positive	i have recommended this website to all my colleagues and friends .

negative	we have been shopping today to look for a better quality replacement .
negative	i am losing money by not using my contract and fear my phone will never be returned to me .
neutral	i was disappointed when my acrylic picture arrived as it has a black particle embedded in the acrylic in a portion of the sky which is instantly obvious - i will not be displaying it .
neutral	i used boiler_juice several_times now , i use it simply cause its the easy way to get fairly cheap oil . i know by ring around i can get it cheaper . but normally with group discount etc it works out about the same .
negative	worst customer service i have ever received in my life ( 00 years ), looks_like infurn are monitoring this website and trying to mop up .
negative	in a nutshell . they will make you jump_through many hoops to cancel then take your money anyway .
neutral	each time i had to re - enter the same lengthy details over and over again .
negative	so after countless_emails and a few telephone_calls chess are still claiming that i have never contacted them and that i owe them money ( which they are adding fees to despite their claims of no small_print )
positive	the fitter phoned me on the day to give me an estimated time of arrival - arrived just before that time .
positive	then after one week i was converted .
positive	after a hiccup with an item i tried to get on line - it suddenly disappeared !
neutral	i had black and yellow fingers for a few_days , which was disappointing .
positive	excellent website .
negative	i would not use watchfinder again as i have a feeling that they sold me a dud .
neutral	still only have 00 days to return , so i hope she likes it more than i do .
positive	well_done would definitely use them again if i was looking for appliances .
neutral	i don_'_t see how having the code upside_down adds to security .

positive	will_definitely use ace - fx again
neutral	0 .
neutral	registered my disappointment but as a positive soul for the most part i regarded the matter to be well resolved .
positive	good choice of trophies , speedy delivery , no_fuss , no_hassle , very happy with the service
neutral	when i opened the envelope containing the fittings , there were just two brackets .
positive	i have not yet installed the dishwasher and fridge which i purchased so cannot_comment on the products themselves .
positive	this allowed_me to purchase three bottles of perfume for the same price as i was about to pay for one in the high_street .
negative	didn_'_t happen of course .
positive	only_thing i will say is the sizing is snug .
negative	i know i for one will never use ebookers again and i haven_'_t even taken off yet !!

positive	thank_you .
negative	waste of time and i will not use again steer_clear .

neutral	i had also been advised of a delivery date being a thursday , advised my clients of this , only to find it was going out on the friday .
neutral	good range of cat toys on site at competitive_prices .
neutral	it was only because i had been in store that i knew what the product actually looked like .
positive	i will_definitely buy from this department store again and would recommend anyone to give them a try .!!
neutral	i will not be using serenata again .
neutral	my friend tells_me she never recieved her flowers that is why i am disappointed , but serenata have been very helpfull trying to resolve this problem .
negative	i checked the description again online - it does_state dimensions but does not say ' deep fitted ' as most other shops do .
positive	one shortcoming is the very slow website .
neutral	prompt response to email that said cheque was in post and i received it a couple of days_later .
neutral	or is it ageism you are now applying co - op ?
neutral	delivery guys were great .
neutral	this did not arrive and i subsequently found out that it was no_longer being manufactured .
negative	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .
positive	i was dubious as i hadn_'_t heard if the company , but decided to give it a go .
negative	how rude ?
neutral	but onboard costs were very high .
negative	update -
neutral	i contacted them first to see if i could do one big order but they couldn_'_t do it for me so i had to sit & plough thru it for myself .
neutral	the cables i ordered were offered at a reasonable price , and were in stock to merlins credit .
neutral	on - line purchase was reasonably straightforward allowing me to pick a fitting time , but only let_me know they might not be able to keep to this after i bought the tyres .
positive	delivery was great also !
negative	i have use this company before with great results , however this time things have been a joke .
neutral	!
neutral	anyone in the village could have directed him to my house .

neutral	cost and compatibility good compared to original nespresso .
positive	its much_cheaper_than here and their service is impeccable , i receive everything as quickly as if i lived in the uk .
positive	great buy and easy as 0 , 0 , 0 . from_start to finish .
neutral	since ordering & paying for my clubs around 0_weeks_ago i have not received any form of communication , i do think that an email or text informing_me of any delay or problem is not too much to ask , still_awaiting delivery
neutral	overall a satisfactory trip .
negative	it was a stressful experience , made even more so by the fact that the travellers were told nothing , other than the initial information about being delayed by an_hour .
positive	the costume i brought for myself is perfect and it was a really good price .
neutral	placed order and quoted delivery by tuesday .

neutral	i suffered from heart palpitations .
positive	i won_'_t go_anywhere_else now for cruising .
neutral	i also personally believe they are restricting access to the extremely low rates they were offering me on this card compared to modern day rates , and this may have happened to many , many others too .
neutral	don_'_t know if this is still the case .
positive	fantastic location , fantastic villa it was a wonderful holiday .
positive	good value for money , would use this company again .
neutral	luckily i have a very handy husband who had to cut the barrel to make it fit .
positive	though this may have been a one - off !
negative	it was a large cheque to be presented to a charity , and the end_result is deeply embarrassing .

negative	they couldn_'_t even tell me which courier firm they had used .
negative	i have never been so disapointed with flowers !

neutral	it would be easier to deal with 000vet if they accepted scanned copies of prescriptions by e_- mail , which some other_suppliers are doing now .
negative	it was delivered broken .
positive	there is an excellent website top ensure a really good fit - if you use it properly unlike me .
negative	have been with flogas since 0000 and dealt_with the huttoft branch in lincolnshire things have gone from bad to worse . my husband has_been ill and had not checked the gas levels so we ran_out of gas 00 jan rag the huttoft number and explained the situation that my husband had been ill ( he is also disabled and cannot get around ) the man of the telephone said there was no chance of getting any gas today as he could not contact the depot as they were not answering their phone i explained this was an_emergency we had no hot_water of use of our cooker without it he said that he was sorry but he could not do anything about it .
negative	after waiting a few_days and no arrival i logged on to my account to check the order status and for the second time my order has_been cancelled without informing_me .

neutral	in the end , delivery took 00 weeks .
positive	cheapest prices & fast delivery , excellent !
positive	ordered my hot_water cylinder on monday and it was delivered tuesday good price and good quality .
negative	i ordered a few items on a friday , then saw my physio again and the knee_brace i had ordered was incorrect , so e_- mailed to cancel it on the monday but was told my order had been dispatched , so would have to send it back - i didn_'_t remember getting the dispatched e_- mail , so the next_day , after checking , sent them another e_- mail telling them as such , asking when they sent the e_- mail and when i could expect my delivery .
negative	the delivery times were late in the day which is not ideal when flowers have been despatched the previous evening .
neutral	but the finishing is poor , plastic stud fasteners , one of which has pulled_out of the material since using .
negative	we '_ve cancelled your order ".
neutral	what world are some of these_people living in ?
neutral	well_packaged , quick and the right thing for the job but very pricey for what it is
positive	top quality golf shirt , delivered promptly .

positive	the mud , hairs and slobber from my yellow labrador is contained within the liner which is very easy to clean .
neutral	this is a good company , always_willing and able to answer any_questions .
neutral	they do not phone you to say there is a delay , they just wait for you to realise flowers not arrived with recipient and call them !
neutral	i waited a whole 00 days and then wasn_'_t in when delivery made , items left with neighbour which was fine but no contact info for delivery person - was wanting to order more items and also see what he had with him as i understand you can buy on doorstep .
neutral	however - before my order arrives i get two promotional messages offering me other stuff - each message a strong reminder of the failure to delver - and then - and then - as if to rub_salt into my wound - a survey to complete .
negative	by tuesday no sign of yodel , so called the clothes company to be told a collection had been attempted and that a card had been left .
neutral	shower curtains can be replaced for an extremely low_cost , and the fact that they had not been replaced for the season just goes to show how little you think of the comfort of your clients .
positive	on return called when luggage collecte at collection_point within the 00_minutes .
positive	from the initial phone_call to order my ring clive was absolutely_brilliant ! he explained in detail how the ring would be made tand i was kept up to date every few_days as to inform_me at which stage my ring was at .

negative	i definitely uploaded this when i ordered and inotice other people have had the same problem .
positive	i would thoroughly_recommend parcel_hero and have subsequently used them for both uk and european deliveries which have received the same high_quality service .
negative	all fair_enough , they effectively grabbed it and put it up for sale .

neutral	disappointed with the customer service team who continued to make ambitious claims about delivery on the tuesday , saying that i might still get my items the very next_day , even thought they admitting using second class_post !

neutral	no communcation as to how long it would take to do these , but apart_from that no_problems .
negative	!
negative	these flowers were for a bereavment and was shocking the eay they were delivered .
positive	good prices , fast delivery and all the right sort of noises whenever you ask them anything .
neutral	not having to see a consultant , a wider_range of products including meals which are all veggie ( as am i ) and being_able to buy it all online .
positive	i have added a logo and they look very professional .
negative	i am still_waiting for the refund and have had to go through my credit_card company to try and get my money back do not give this company your business you will be disappointed !!
positive	briiliant service !
negative	they swapped me to <_external link_removed >. they came ok . not happy at all . its starts off with one parcel and could of lead to 000 ; s , very poor service . thought they had 0000 vans . ok snow i could understand not picking_up first day . but i did book it 0 days before pick_up .
negative	they sent me black pumps instead .
negative	booked a delivery for a sunday expecting a roast for sunday lunch - delivery between 0pm and 0pm - at 0pm i got a call saying they couldn_'_t make it ( after being_fobbed_off on the phone & no lunch ).
neutral	but , this is the only time i '_ve had problems with them .
negative	so when you phone the phone rings for six minutes unanswered .
neutral	brakes could do with being on the handles or being_able to use with the foot as i have a bad back and it hurts me to bend to put the brakes on and off .
positive	the chat service provide by parcel0go was a most convenient way to resolve my small problem and the representative that i was in communication with was most helpful and understanding .
neutral	so lets go then : the looking for properties to rent was easy and straightforward as all you had to do was put in your preferences and a list came out .
positive	i found the site easy to navigate , easy to enter my euro vat number , easy to get a reasonable delivery to france and then the tools arrived in 0 days .
neutral	i think the problem should have been picked_up at quality control before sending it out .
neutral	ordered fire online that stated a date for delivery of 00 oct .
neutral	so , thank_goodness for the faster blaster dual action pump - a much_easier and more robust product .
neutral	£_00 for a dozen_red_roses they look half_dead was a bit disappointed they didn_'_t really say i love you more like i can '_t stand you ballon and chocolates was fine tho

neutral	the paste went everywhere but in the mouth !
negative	thank_you tmobile costumer service that i have spent 0 week without phone and already have paid £_00 for nothing .
neutral	i really do hope zen_bedrooms reads these comments ; judging_by the comments i '_ve found online from other people , a recurring issue is your delivery process .
positive	thanks jw
neutral	the process is easy to navigate , but , in the last few_years , fees have been added to the transaction cost , negating the advantage of a good exchange_rate for smaller transactions .
neutral	again this delivery was handled by dx_freight , this there were no issues and they turned_up within the time frame .
neutral	however , the item takes a week to get to me . not a great experience at all
negative	the customer service is extremely un - satisfactory !
positive	0 pairs of gorgeous frames plus lenses cost no more than a meal for two in my local_pub .
neutral	historically , it was simple to select the product catagory and scroll to one '_s required item .
positive	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
negative	if the management and customer service team where efficient at dealing_with their customers as the individual or team who responds to poor reviews on this site then the company would no doubt be far more successful .
neutral	i '_ll form an opinion when i have a fact and not a promise .
positive	it was a nice idea to include a few samples and a lovely nail_file all of which i have enjoyed using .
neutral	not as much green as the picture .
neutral	initially all was well with a very good free ' home_trial ' service that i would recommend everyone use before buying .
positive	delivery very fast as usual , all items complete .
neutral	we had a baby with us and were only given one sheet for the travel_cot ( which was well past its sell by date and certainly not worth the £_00 extra i had to pay for it ).
neutral	what a stupid way to do_business .
neutral	the whole villa desperately_needed updating , especially the bathrooms .
negative	last_week i sent another mail asking to refund me back wowcher is keep silence .
positive	often retailers will state free delivery but add the cost to the item - this was not the case as the cost of the items were very competitive .
neutral	ordered the camera and then the day before delivery was due i rang them to check as i needed to take a day off work , only to be told the delivery address didn_'_t match the credit_card address exactly and i needed to send proof of address in the form of a credit_card bill etc .
neutral	this is a cost_effective , quick and efficient way to have frames made for pictures .
negative	if you are tempted , then use paypal so at_least you are protected .
positive	wasn_'_t completely sure which was the correct version but mr_memory '_s site clarified it , the price was good , and the ram arrived promptly .
neutral	what '_s that all about ?
negative	don_'_t use citylink .
negative	often now lowest_price means general lower standards .
negative	so looking_forward to that
positive	very very perfect service .
negative	beware too when buying online .
negative	i feel that the ceo of orange should be_ashamed of the people he has working for him .
negative	this takes them 00 days to return .
positive	left our car and went away for a week .
positive	i would use this service again in the future as the costumes were amazing and the costs were also reasonable .
positive	i received my shoes very quickly .
positive	got a camper and an awning , awning didn_'_t fit up gutter .
negative	i put in a support request for ' where is my order ' and three_days_later was advised ,
neutral	all in all not a very good start to the holiday , in a foreign_country with potentially no booking .
negative	when i attempted to cancel they first offered my a different bike which was of slightly_higher retail price but worse spec .
positive	perfect service .
negative	as above .
neutral	when i tried to change my hire to a sun pick_up instead to make my travel_plans work better due to the late notice that they couldn_'_t change my hire to the fri , i couldn_'_t get_hold of any one from the uk side of the company to make the necessary changes .
neutral	the invitations were a different color than the envelopes . otherwise everything in the order was as we requested .
negative	they took a phone number but later said they never phone it unless lost .
negative	always mess up my monthly repeat order .
neutral	our village group found a few suppliers 0 or 0 pence_per_litre cheaper , for the same day delivery .
negative	und checken wo sie wohnt .
neutral	however the bag it was in was burst & the postman handed it to me with the bag inside the cardboard_box .
neutral	my other cat was much_easier as i mixed the paste in with his traets and he ate them all up , no problem .
positive	dagenham
neutral	it '_s at this point that you need four hands and a little patience as lining up the holes is a bit_tricky .
positive	super quick delivery
positive	went to this site asit had the best price for the food_mixer i wanted .
positive	this is why i have no_hesitation in rating little_sunflowers 0_stars .
positive	i will most certainly recommend the partyrama experience to as many people as i can .
neutral	they did not have wifi so i had to go to a hotel with my laptop to try and locate the email from 0_weeks previously .
neutral	the lever cannot close as it ought to .
positive	the whole set feels strong and should last for years .
neutral	and the explanation that i received when i emailed you about it is very convoluted - from what i could gather , the priority part only covers within the uk ?
negative	but the goods were not suitable and were returned on the 00 / 00 /_0000
neutral	firstly , it did not come on the allocated day and when it did arrive the day after , it was left on my doorstep and i live on a main_road .
neutral	otherwise pleased with the value and the level of communication
negative	went elsewhere and had exceptional service from_start to finish . and there was definitely enough thread used in the embroidery to avoid patches .
positive	definately considering using the company for my weekly clean .
negative	son then went to new hotel which was not in the area he wanted , was a dump and to top it all there was nothing booked in his name !
neutral	i was then told i would receive my money back , but would have preferred if the missing item was just sent to me .
negative	i could blame the member of staff who signed for the parcel but surely putting a name on it wouldn_'_t have been too much to ask ??????
neutral	very unhappy that my booking was only confirmed about a few hours before my pick - up time .
negative	i hope i make you realise what a mistake it would be to go with phones 0 u , go with anyone_else , just not them !
neutral	the glasses were returned , and a no_quibble refund was issued .
neutral	general_manager writes to me telling_me about latest offer and inviting me to visit showroom a few_days after i had just bought a new car .
neutral	ordered red_rose boquet which arrived on time .
positive	a very good way to buy tyres .
negative	with amazon .
negative	unlike_other_reviewers here who have had awful service from myhermes , i am in the fortunate position of running my own pr business , i will be contacting all of the myhermes directors and will then relate my experience on every social_media and forum on the internet .
negative	a week_later another phone arrived .
neutral	bought a tv , delivery was quick , cheap and well_packaged but the tv wasn_'_t working :-(
positive	i '_m so glad i did as not only was their ordering via website easy and quick , their delivery was also very wuick , and the dyson was with me before i knew it !
positive	i read countless threads etc .
positive	would most definitely recommend & use again .
neutral	also , they have a pouch for knee_pads , but because the pocket is too long , they end up as shin_pads .
positive	will use again and again
neutral	unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable you could feel the springs so much so we had to sleep with the quilt underneath us .
positive	would recommend this company to everyone and anyone - good efficient service , well_organised , love having the e_mails and texts , no excuse not to be in when delivery to be made .
negative	tried to order from vet_medic and set_up an account .
negative	if my rug does not arrive in the next few_days i will be calling back and will be cancelling my order and expecting a full_refund plus compensation for my time and phone_calls wasted !
negative	i regret to say following this experience i will be avoiding this company from hereon as they clearly do not care about the individuals involved .
neutral	it can also be frustrating to search for music on their site and find out that they don_'_t have it .
positive	i am so pleased the garden looks wonderful and stylish just need the sun now .
negative	i returned an item that was too small 0_days after i bought it i sent it back re ; the courier company use .
negative	chased again yesterday by email , received a sarcastic , short unhelpful email . basically telling_me it should arrive monday or tuesday .
neutral	fortunately the neighbour turned_up with the parcel 00_hours_later .
negative	they refused to let_me return it .
negative	i was contacted by optical_express by phone many_times telling_me that there is a surgical procedure to cure my vision .

positive	good value , good kit , accurately_described , quickly delivered .
positive	fast delivery too .
neutral	at_least the results indicated that .
neutral	the experience with booking the car was great .
neutral	my father - in - law drove the 00 miles dutifully to make the collection on my specified date to be met with some rather unhelpful staff .
negative	i waited a matter of days for what should have been a simple answer regarding the acceptable weight for her plyometric box , once finally answered with a belligerent response i proceeded to purchase only to find she had increased the price by 00_% simply because i had shown an interest .
negative	the 000kw project was suposed to be finished by christmas 0000 .
neutral	0 .
negative	i '_ve still not even received an acknowledgement from viagogo of the problem , and this is proving to be a nightmarish transaction .
positive	so win_win as they say !
positive	i have ordered from chaos_cards a few_times and have never had any_problems , i will_continue to order from them .
negative	we purchased a cabinet and the delivery driver who assumed my wife was on her own proceeded to bully her ( bearing in mind that she is only 0ft 0 ".)
negative	because stena ships are more modern and take account of modern cars being slightly_wider .
positive	great !
negative	good luck if you try using them !
neutral	don_'_t use this company if you ' re running_low in stocks as delivery takes about 0 working_days !
positive	they have not been put in_situ yet but were delivered very quickly and within the hour time_slot i was expecting .
neutral	i also did not heal correctly so it has left me short of 00 / 00 vision but still within driving_standards which is good .
neutral	the phone back is to small on one side a doesn_'_t fit the front of the phone was really hard to put on and had to take it off twice to get it straight because of this the front stretched and i had to end up cutting one side to get it to fit .
positive	although tom told me that the watch would be delivered in superb condition , i still had reservations at buying a pre_owned_watch from the internet , but when the watch actually arrived , i was blown_away with the condition .
positive	ordered on sunday_afternoon , had choice to collect on the monday from warehouse for free or select home delivery in dundee area mon / wed / fri 0pm - 0pm .
negative	i placed my order for two rings and on 00th_august collected my fiance '_s ring .
neutral	if i had been told i would have to pay for express delivery , i would have done this .
neutral	not sure if i will use this site again unless there are special_offers on .
negative	really amusing that of course its the customers fault as he " didnt see " hidden away information_relating to the companies stock_levels , nothing what so ever to do with my " order was accepted on a next_day delivery basis " & that no attention was drawn to the fact that the item was out of stock .
negative	regards ,
neutral	however i thought the idea of exante was great .
negative	but due to some reasons i had to return the speakers within 00 days .
negative	after_reading the emails , it appeared that they would only arrange delivery after dispatch .
positive	the only_thing i was unhappy about , was that some of the tins were damaged , well , quite a few actually , but that is only to be expected i suppose !
neutral	i then received a further email_stating that the watch is no_longer available .
neutral	was looking at gamola_golf website and spyed and pair of adidas adipure golf_shoes in black and white that i decided to buy . already having a white pair and have been impressed at their comfort i thought a black and white pair would be a good purchase .
positive	fantastic easy purchases every time .
neutral	unfortunately , 0_stars deducted for delivery .
negative	it was supposed to be collected on the following_day with ups .
positive	animed did what it said on the tin .
positive	i remain impressed .
positive	excellent value and service .
positive	i cannot_fault them , and i will definitely use them again .
neutral	0 %_discount offered by steve on email did not apply to toad park which i have booked
negative	i would advise anyone not to buy from them
neutral	unless holiday_autos start indicating which cars are from a fuel scam provider before i book , then i won_’_t be using them again .
negative	i continued trying to contact interspares to arrange the return of the motor and a refund but never go a reply .
positive	what fantastic service - deliveries are so efficient , they always have the products i want and at great prices too .
neutral	now why couldn_'_t they have put a note in with the order to explain that , or why could they have not replied to the email to that effect .
neutral	i have been purchasing wild_bird_food for almost 0 years from gjw_titmuss .
negative	originally placed order due to having visitors and wanted to use mattress for our guest .
positive	love this when i buy stuff on line and this guy arrives in his fiat_panda . he '_s friendly and the car has more dent '_s every time i see him . love the tracking_number thing . good job .
positive	thanx again
neutral	we sat for half an_hour whilst this was sorted_out , with other diners observing the situation - which was quite embarrassing .
negative	i have lost food in 0 freezers that are in the garage – our chest_freezer and one freezer full of burgers for a cub event that i am organising for 0_weeks ’ time and also lost food in my fridge_freezer indoors .

positive	this is the first time we have used hfe_signs & banners and the level of service at every_stage has_been superb !
positive	excellent value for money , fast & efficient service , would use angling_active again .
negative	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person '_s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don_'_t feel like doing this .
neutral	it took far too many phone_calls to get card save and streamline to sort our trading name , type of company and address details , so much so , to the point that i know that the money is going into the right account and i can '_t be_bothered to check the details they have on file , as i know it will lead to more phone_calls and apologies .
positive	the phone case arrived within two_days of ordering .
positive	i wouldn_'_t hesitate in ordering from the regency_chess company for any future_purchases .
neutral	so i understand that not only are things hectic around that period but also the iflorist may have been closed for part of that time .
negative	i left an enquiry on the website and i am still_waiting on a reply .
negative	he then explained it would have to go in the luggage hold and gave_me a tag and explained one of the groundsmen will take it from me . they didn_'_t , it came in the cabin with me and in the luggage holds above my head .
neutral	maybe they want to wait_until they make the money back in sales before sending it out , or just hold it for a bit to make some interest .
negative	this company sold me a tap that was badly manufactured and needs_replacing with one that is not faulty .
positive	it was , in deed , easy to fit and i now have a vacuum which works as new , thanks to partsmaster .
negative	how can tyres be offered that don ; t even exist ?
positive	we bought replacement led multicolored christmas_tree_lights and outdoor plain_white lights .
neutral	will order elswhere in future
negative	this company will not make it in the internet_shopping world with this level of service .
neutral	overall not too bad , pricing very competitive compared with royal_mail , delivery times excellent , my collection agent is great , it '_s just a great shame that no matter_how well you pack some things , they get beaten within an inch of their lives and the usual cop - out is applied with regards to so - called exempted items when complaining !
positive	they exchanged one of the free gifts they were offering for something_else i really wished for .
negative	and should be avoided at all costs !
neutral	it also said they had tried to deliver it at 0am on the day it did arrive - this was not correct .
negative	on one of the boots i bought , one of the hooks fell_off after one day .
neutral	the courier service has tried to deliver them twice_now and unfortunately i wasn_'_t in the first time - i did phone after the first time , to hermes the courier service , but could only leave a message_advising them of the best time to deliver .
neutral	after mentioning it to the staff they vavuumed some of it out but after having left the rental car station i still found food and trash in the door - and seatpockets .
neutral	having been with this site for couple of years , when making a sale ( which is few and far between i might_add ), i am constantly informed after making a sale that the quality of the image is not good enough !
positive	my order came in first_class time i placed my order on a sunday i got it in a box well_packaged on the tuesday super service i will be using again would recommend to anyone top_marks
positive	bought two essentials frying_pans . bargain price !
neutral	i then emailed them which i was told hadn_'_t been received and was then told that the email address i sent it to wasn_'_t monitored ( this was the email from the confirmation )
positive	my enquiries were dealt_with quickly and efficiently and after i decided to buy a watch i was kept up to date by phone and e_- mail about my delivery .
negative	was promised delivery by 0 . 00pm .
positive	!
negative	i said i resented being called a liar - and she slammed the phone down .
negative	the 0nd_pair i ordered killed my feet on the first time of wearing them and so are useless to me now too as are not just extremely uncomfortable , not true to size and they left me with numerous blisters !
positive	i ' d_happily_recommend to friends and family .
positive	thought i would change supplier after price increases .
positive	which is a big_improvement from 00 meg by default .
positive	i wanted a slimline fridge and freezer ( separates ) to fit into a specific space - they stocked what i needed .
neutral	!
positive	nicely_boxed
negative	funny that , because their online service checker doesn_'_t seem to share that opinion , but their staff obviously know something an_automated checking service does not .
positive	makes travel so much_easier with the added_bonus of arriving home from university to find your dirty clothes have been washed , dried and ironed !!
neutral	i will only use when they have a price promotion on and for boxes of say 00kg they are well overpriced .
negative	but happily placed my order with harts of sturs , and received exactly_what i wanted stunning service with £_00 free gift , free 0 day shipping . and a 00 no_quibble return guarantee .
negative	overall pretty annoyed .
negative	i received notification , and tracked same , yesterday 00 / 00 / 00 that it would be delivered on same day .
positive	one of the best companies i have done business with on line , they have saved me an_absolute fortune on repairing my tv . from the minute you order until your delivery you get excellent service .
negative	i had to write to them asking about their online job application forms !
negative	no money was returned to me . how come wh can void my account and void my open bets - but still have taken my money !
positive	well , i should never have doubted anything as the next_day the ups driver came and collected my parcel , and was delivered the day after .
positive	if my broker is unavailable when i telephone , he phones me back .
neutral	for a similar price
positive	the samples arrived promptly , allowing me to choose the most suitable blind and place my order .
neutral	i booked through this site before viewing others and sadly i paid more but transaction went_smoothly .
negative	cheap glasses maybe , but appalling customer service , hopeless
neutral	eventually the rollers were on the door and eventually it worked .
neutral	you can change routes and days without retyping the infomation which does not change .
negative	it took them about four goes to pick_up the parcel .
neutral	and just 0 months before my contract was due to end , i found out that a business opposite mine ( in a similar_sized office ) had air_conditioning controls !
negative	contacted company took photo of item they denied sending it said they didn_'_t sell asda clothing even_though cardigan was identical to the one on the site which i screen_shot and sent with the picture of the cardigan .
neutral	do not recommend anyone to regus .
negative	so i think i have pretty_much heard and witnessed all that can happen from both_sides of the business .
positive	plenty of restaurants in resort and a great beach .
positive	i '_ve had insurance with these_guys for about 0 years .
positive	your account is easy to access as it does not demand a difficult to remember password or user name which can be so frustrating !
negative	the company are not prepared to do anything to investigate , refund or replace until 00 days after dispatch .
neutral	my credit_limit was £ 0 , 000 .
negative	i received an_email_confirming delivery would be today .
neutral	along with a small cake i ordered the arrangement and requested that , if no one was home , the item was to be left in the back by the shed .
negative	it was taken out of the packaging laid on the floor and put straight back in the packaging and sent back .
neutral	very comfortable material .
negative	where is yours ?
negative	i was wrong .
positive	. we will be using again in the future and would recommend them to anyone .
positive	fantastic prompt service .
positive	excellent website with loads of information_regarding appliance performance , running costs , capacity , noise levels etc .
neutral	i would recommend not paying extra for deluxe , as from the photo , it didn_'_t seem like anymore flowers really .

negative	it still has not arrived despite saying on the website that it should have done !
negative	shouldn_'_t still be trading .
negative	looking on the website the delivery times state between_0am - 0pm , so that could mean i wait in all day monday and then possible all day tuesday as well !
negative	eventually after a heated email i was contacted by them and my name was corrected !
neutral	looks good , nice materials but slightly wrong shape
positive	all taken for a little drive and deposited in a local wood .

neutral	!
positive	considering i placed the order in the evening i was particularly_impressed to get a delivery the day after next .
negative	i have sent many parcels from my work address and all have been received within a day or two .
neutral	they '_ll probably stay on top for a long time , but the way that they ' re running things is giving plenty of opportunities for better sites to swiftly take away their users .
positive	this was my first experience of using a courier sourced from the internet and anyvan made the process perfectly straightforward .
positive	quick response and delivery .
positive	we love our new pen_drives and will no_doubt come_back for more in the future !

neutral	the service of ordering and delivering the cartridge was very efficient but unfortunately even_though the new black and white hp00 cartridge has_been installed correctly i am still unable to print .

negative	spoke to a third person ( in india , i '_m guessing ) & then got put through to her supervisor in the phillipines .

neutral	it '_s disappointing as these were sent as l was unable to be there on the day but feel that she wouldn_'_t complain in these circumstances as most receivers of gifts because of the initial gesture in sending them
negative	bought a pair of glasses including date and time of ordering transaction date : 0000 - 00 - 00 00 : 00 : 00 , i was contacted twice for sending my id documentation , when i did after i recieved only 0 email_saying i should recieve my item within 00 to 00 days but now its months gone and havent_recieved anything . stay away from these fraudesters and rippers , never recommended simply if they dont get back within 00_hrs than i will be contacting my bank and send chargeback .
negative	please could you send your 0 - digit transaction number so that we can look into your order .
neutral	the furniture was great but we ended_up with the wardrobe left in the lounge because the delivery drivers couldn_'_t take it up the stairs because of health and safety !!!
positive	everything went_smoothly from putting the item in my basket to receiving the item via delivery .
positive	very happy with everything .
negative	i want my money back or a confirmation of an exact delivery date .
positive	i ordered quite late and still received delivery next_day .

positive	reasonably_priced , beautiful_flowers .
negative	why let_me order in the first place ,?
neutral	ordering easy .
positive	i ordered a zirco sink and insinkerator waste_disposal .

positive	quoted price seemed fair but always subject to re valuation upon_receipt which i just thought meant i '_d get less but true to word got price quoted so definitely not scammers !
neutral	it was a lovely apartment for a short_stay , would not choose it for longer as no washing_machine .
negative	however , there wasn_'_t even a comment or e_- mail to apologise for the inconvenience .
neutral	i personally would nt use them again , on the website it states to allow up to 00 days for them to receive items but after that it takes up to another 0_days for the items to be processed in the warehouse then you receive an_email asking to verify your bank details and states payment can take up to another 0_days .
negative	it appears they are very poor at refunding your money , although they seem to be able to extract it from your account quickly enough .
neutral	i replied immediately and said to go_ahead with the order and i picked a replacement rug to the same value .
neutral	!
positive	the reps at our destination were waiting for us and took us to our taxi , after that they were only a phone_call away .
negative	such a faulty connection meant that there were whole parts of a day ( 0 - 0 hours ) when i wasn_'_t even able to send an_email .
positive	i spoke to one of the staff to place my order .
positive	ordered from them for the first time and then i wanted the delivery faster_than 0 - 0days so they happily changed it to a premium delivery for me and was very helpful lady on the phone that assisted_me .
positive	chris and his_team stayed in contact including the driver of the car to ensure confidence .
neutral	sometimes i long for the good old days of the big fat paper catalogue when you could just circle the things you wanted then phone your order through .
positive	btw amazon . co . uk rocks to !

neutral	i am fairly skilled being a shop fitter , but anyone with minimal skills would struggle .
positive	the size_guide was useful .
negative	i ordered two items for my girlfriend in october ( for christmas !)
negative	when i recieved my package the box was very battered , looked like it had been thown around the warehouse for 00 years but i thought it wouldnt matter because it would just be the outer_packaging and my 0000 bags would be in another box / dispenser but how wrong i was - upon_opening the battered box the bags were just loose inside and most of them were creased and folded in places as if someone and just got a bunch of bags and just chucked them in - there didnt even look as if there were a 0000 there .
positive	i sent the mone on sat and i will receive the money in my country 0_days_later , the same than i used but saving £_00 !!

negative	i know it was my fault with the time mistake , but it does not take this long to rectify a problem .
negative	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .
negative	all i think is happening is ' hit and trail '.
neutral	all this nonsense about " lost in the post " " chinese ny " doesn_'_t cut it .
positive	thank_you very much .
neutral	i arrived a few_minutes earlier just before 00_minutes so waited fr a few_minutes .
negative	having placed an order and paid vis paypal there was subsequent confusion about payment and dispatch so i contacted healthspark on 0 occasions asking if they would check the staus of the order . needless to say i am still_awaiting a response !

negative	must be an epidemic down there as they are ignoring my emails again !!
positive	we must also congratulate the company on the accuracy of the photographs on the website that gave_us a true impression of the rug .
negative	all the lillies were in bud so no flowers .
positive	their site was very easy to use , and they were really quick to send me a free_sample_pack .
neutral	we tried hiring a lens from the lensforhire website , but it failed the first time because it would not accept our card_details , which meant we were forced to do it the next_day and miss the pick_up date we needed !
neutral	finally i have chosen the moisture mittens and socks and despite chasing them have still not recieved them !!
positive	i '_ve recommended the wrist_bands to friends so i suspect kiddymania will get further orders from us !
positive	great buy and very quick
positive	computer_desk and sideboard well_packaged and no_problems !
positive	the telephone sales_team were very efficient and easy to deal with .
positive	would definitely recommend .
neutral	very good service but a little disappointed with the short use by dates .
neutral	the fire_alarm going at at half 0 in the morning was just great .
neutral	fortunately it is a small_village so the house finding the flowers on the doorstep knew where they should be - the address given was correct , but delivery had been made to the wrong building .
negative	- unfair terms ( no replacement if you don_'_t notice damage within 0 - days of delivery
positive	ordered 0 items on saturday and received on tuesday even_though we are in the christmas_rush would use this company again and lots of emails_advising status of order 00 / 00 a +++

negative	they take your money .
neutral	i was told by the girl in the store it would be ready for me to pick it up on a particular day when in fact it wouldn_'_t be there until 0_days_later .
positive	phoned the order in and the person_who answered could not have been more helpful .
neutral	fortuneatly as i was about to leave the mattress was delivered .
neutral	i think it '_s best to leave this as honest feedback , in that if you have other people reporting something similiar , you will know there is an issue .
neutral	i feel that no consideration is being given to the ability of passengers to walk the distance involved .
negative	that was three_weeks_ago .
negative	checked all my stuff from e0save and it '_s all above board , with no mention of redemption or cashback from them etc_etc .
neutral	add to this that all their emails end up in your bulk folder i won_'_t be buying from them again !
negative	i saw a video of the loading_bay when hermes couriers were handling customer '_s packages they were thrown around , kicked and generally mishandled including being left_outside in the rain the couriers vehicles were private cars stuffed full of packages .
negative	it seems their parent_company telephonica was a fortune in debt .

neutral	horror on arrival , wrong glass .
neutral	pro : value for money , delivery tracking_system .
negative	for most people receiving a final_bill for £ 0000 would be distressing .

neutral	the online booking service is one i use regulary .
positive	really loved the furniture biggest problem is picking which one to have
negative	everyones story is the same with this company , they offer a big amount then cut it down to pennies , then they try to charge you £ 0 . 00 to return the handset - but on mensioning trading_standards or bbc_watchdog they say they '_ll re - look at the handset and give original offer .
negative	finally i launched a paypal complaint against them and they finally said they would arrange a courier collection .

positive	i would recommend this site , hassle_free and efficient .
negative	come possano lavorare in queste condizioni ?
neutral	i have emailed wowcher twice - just had an acknowledgement but no action .
neutral	my item took over 0_weeks to arrive despite_being told at time of order it would be up to 0 working_days .

positive	i was concerned that once i '_d send my mobile off to you that the price would suddenly change and i '_d be in a clause ( like some other services have attempted with friends and family ) but there wasn_'_t .
negative	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
negative	this means if you don_'_t like a company , you can destroy its reputation easily by reporting all positive_reviews .
neutral	no user_friendly phone number .
neutral	we would stay here again as it '_s the only villa with wheelchair access which we need .
negative	00 years_ago i moved in with my partner who decided that we needed a telephone and internet access , we had everything plumbed in so to speak and off the line went no_issues until we got a bill for over_£_000 , it included a line fitting which we shouldn_'_t have paid and telephone_calls to numbers that we had never_heard of . bt would not back down that the numbers were nothing to do with us and we had to pay the bill which took over 0 years !!!

negative	probably thinks her commission is safe ?
positive	i purchased this type of rim lock for my brand_new back gate which i made a few_years_ago .
negative	i feel very very let_down by partyrama .
neutral	i did think maybe i had just been a bit unlucky with the first i ordered so i have relatively recently_purchased another from you as i did find delivery and other items good in the past but sadly the same has happened and i have now had to revert to other_websites to buy the atomisers and fluid chamber .
negative	into the bargain the operator was downright rude .
negative	then i found out that the property , who i never gave my credit_card_details had charged it again .
negative	had to call a collection number and tap in a false account number ( obviously not recognised ) so system would transfer me to a human .
neutral	delivery was excellent .
positive	great products at very reasonable_prices , fast delivery every time
positive	the service is good and the site is easy to use .

positive	first off , the delivery time was incredible – i received tracking_information 00_hours after_placing the order .
negative	i think the products on this website are fake as i '_ve always bought this product from my salon and its worked_wonders for me .

negative	very excited when it arrived . and so disappointed !
negative	as it was out of their office hours , unlike the phone line was saying , i was unable to speak to a member of their team .
neutral	i therefore won_'_t recommend this product to anyone and am very worried as i purchased one for a friend at the same time and now i '_m worried i have given her a very poor quality gift .
positive	i will be setting about putting_together another book for our_wedding day .
negative	don_'_t imagine you can complain though because they wont be there .
positive	brass handles of a very good quality - most pleased with them .
positive	each vehicle selected was described in full and the final vehicle chosen was recommended to fit the purpose it was required for .
negative	surely he must have realised that i '_ve just had a new avon on the same axle and that as it '_s also the drive axle , it '_s even more important that it shouldn_'_t have two different tyre manufacturers on it !

neutral	good prices but you cannot combine deals .
negative	i must have sent the same question in now at_least a dozen_times via the on line contact form and / or apple email address and they don_'_t even answer - perhaps they don_'_t know the answer .

positive	the goods i ordered came promptly and was well_packaged
positive	website easy to use too
negative	our flat maid was asking customers to check the cleaning status before signing the acceptance of the property on arrival , but obviously there is always something that cannot be perfect even if very cheap , and consequently to low review housetrip cancelled all the future bookings , even upcoming in a couple of days with a loss for us of few thousand euros .

positive	its brilliant but you have to double_check when clicking for your orders .

positive	!
positive	excellent !!!
neutral	you can understand how a supermarket will suddenly go out of stock on some items but sometimes the substitutions are a little_confusing eg ; a tin of cat_food instead of 0 tins of dog_food !
positive	at these prices you expect some corners to be cut .
neutral	i have my own business and i understand how important it is to keep relationships with your clients but this for me was very disappointing .
positive	no_complaints . fast and easy service .
neutral	now i appreciate you have pick - up '_s to make and someone has to be 0st and someone has to be last , this i can accept , but i think being on a coach or hanging_around for over 0 hours on what is in fact a 00min journey is unacceptable , so sorry , having serious thoughts abouth booking again because of this problem , so look into this alpharooms and i will definitely be booking again .
negative	booket one week accommodation in rio_de janeiro through_expedia . co . uk .
negative	after being collected from my hotel the coach driver went on to make 0 stops in the neighbouring resort only to then turn back on himself and go past my hotel .

positive	great service a lot of other web_sites very tricky and expensive
negative	with " small fees '" of course .
neutral	you have to keep an eye on the site for updates to your claim , e_- mail reminders were inconsistent and timed ( in my mind ) to gloat and wind me up .
neutral	i checked my email again but no email was found .
neutral	not sure if it was sent damaged or the delivery company damaged it .
neutral	booked on the 0th of april still no sign of them .
neutral	oscar looks good , but doesn_'_t feel good .

positive	i placed two orders , seperately , on the same evening .
negative	no apology nothing !
negative	i realize that zero is less_than 00 but don_'_t accept that this meets any form of trade description .
neutral	eventually i got an experience day voucher from them and when i went to the web_site to use the code it was rejected as invalid .
positive	comparing their prices with other competitors i also found that they were competitively_priced .
neutral	the website says most orders are dispatched in 00_hours , and you are updated etc_etc , however , the ordder was placed on 00th_june and i heard_nothing withing the 00hours , so i had to email to chase up .
neutral	not great some things are cheap but the rest is overpriced just like b and q
neutral	it took another few_days and a day off work to finally get the camera .
neutral	she obviously did not like them at all .
positive	as soon as they got hold of it , they adjusted it to the right size and immediately sent it with a next_day delivery , which came first thing in the morning .
positive	will certainly use again and tell my friends .
neutral	though there was a problem with a fan not fitting the base i had ordered but no one thought to let_me know , only that i had phoned , did they choose to let_me know .
neutral	previously the tops were great , however unfortunately a bit disappointed with this order

positive	easy to navigate website and really quick efficient service .
negative	!
neutral	it was a mini - break .

neutral	however , cracks started to appear the week before we went when a member of the group called the hotel to make an enquiry , only to be told that they didn_'_t have our booking !
neutral	happy with product , however , delivery time was a joke and no tracking_facility
negative	will now have to pay someone_else to deliver the goods , probably hermes as they are supposed to be good .
neutral	not bad by any means , but could do a lot better .
negative	it takes 0 working_days normally with post . where is it ?
neutral	as for the products : on my computer the cartridges are always shown as empty - a nuisance .
neutral	i have used trushopping several_times in the past & have always found they provided good value for money with good service & delivery . however , i have recently found the website to be very slow & irritating & almost abandoned one order before i got to the basket because it was so slow to respond .
positive	and excellent prices , nearly_half the price that i would have paid at the vets , even taking into account the cost of the presciption .
neutral	although they were polite and helpful , the said items were received after several days and had a £ 0 excess postage charge as not enough stamps had been put onto the envelope .
neutral	a friend of mine came out in quite extreme shock and went back the next_day to complain .
positive	i think you can tell that i am extremely pleased with the service , i made a number of inquiries to different sites as i needed some usb_drives made quickly .
neutral	it is not user_friendly especially registering the animals etc .
neutral	considering i ' d spent £_000 on this machine i was rather peeved that they didn_'_t want to know about helping sort this problem .
positive	i placed my order , chose a delivery date which suited me , which was the first thumbs_up , since with other_websites or deliveries it usually_arrives on their schedule .
positive	i can '_t stress enough how amazing this is and if you are in any doubt then go for a consultation - i wish i had done it sooner !
neutral	not happy , but ordered 0 breakfasts at a stupid cost .

positive	great service , thank_you .
neutral	quite annoyed , so phoned to find out what they were playing at .
negative	up to bulkpowders to make this up to me and to change my mind about them and to change a bad_experience into a good one as i believe the products are very good quality and their different quantity packaging is a good idea as well allowing you to try a product by buying a smaller amount or to fit your budget .
negative	suffice to say , no goods arrived after several emails of promises , can '_t get through to helpline , always in a queue .
positive	vive le juno .

neutral	i shopped_around and tried multitrip again and to my surprise i was quoted a price just a few_pounds higher_than last_year .

positive	i would use that company i was impressed withe service as thet delivered it the next_day pretty_much , and with a great deal too .
neutral	when i phoned drum_stop to question this i was told that they received it from the manufacturer without the bag . and that was it !
positive	first_class service by plumb world with a very speedy delivery service .
negative	they put the wrong product on their site , it was their mistake , which to be fair they admitted but it '_s a nightmare to return them , they soon took my money i just want it back , simple . it '_s hard when you can '_t just pick_up the phone as they ' re in spain .
neutral	breakfast was very good - maybe over ambitious for the space available .
negative	the three that weren_'_t delivered were supposedly left in a safe location , the communal_hallway of my building by the front_door .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will be ordering from here again .
neutral	none of the people i recommended to sign up thinks it is worth it .
positive	the flowers were delivered on time and most_importantly , the recipient is very pleased with them - and the cake !
positive	how fantastic .
neutral	this was a very small bottle of perfume and it was really obvious that there was less_than 0 / 0 in the bottle , so i could not give this as a gift , as i had intended .
neutral	ordered sofa_bed on the basis of a uk made , reasonably_priced and quick delivery .
neutral	we went for the grandissimo option as this was the biggest and best option for the chosen flowers and on delivery we were exceptionally under whelmed with the bouquet .
positive	turnaround time was quick , and i am delighted with both the products i ordered and the general level of service .
neutral	we trust those who collate the order to be expert st ensuring the order is complete as such items do not register on the non - professional .
neutral	ordered 0 rolls of paper from a sample , total £_000 .
positive	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd '_s next_day premium service !
positive	isn_'_t it amazing that to be able to sample the best of something as great as chocolate is relatively affordable !
positive	i found what i was looking for and it was reasonnably priced .
neutral	there were no instructions prior to purchasing the voucher regarding this and as i was approaching the " use before " date i had to use photos of a lower resolution than recommended .
neutral	unfortunately the first flowers i ordered died within a day but after a complaint another bunch was sent which were much_better
negative	they apologised and asked me to send the wrong item back , claiming they would refund the postage and that the 0rd item i am waiting for is not in stock now .
negative	!
neutral	part of order was sent incorrectly , initial call to customer_services didn_'_t yield the anticipated response but email response was very good and customer_services apologised and will send the correct item .
positive	found item to be cheaper_than elsewhere on internet , quality branded goods , quick prompt delivery , what more could you ask
negative	they promised to ring me within 00_hours to confirm it , which of course didn_'_t happen .
negative	seriously though , i have never felt so strongly before that i have felt it worth taking up my time to warn_others of such poor service – beware !!
neutral	order arrived incomplete and poorly packed with a broken item .
neutral	the staff were pleasant and polite but not that helpful on reception , never been there before - booked in and asked where to find my room , i was carrying my bags / suit , staff pointed towards the entrance and said " its just to the left " - so i walked out the doors and turned left - all doors on the outside are locked , walked back in reception to ask again - and only then did they show me the door on the left next to reception - so they watched me walk out of the building after asking where my room was , carrying everything and no one thought that i had missed the correct door ?
positive	please_beware that the clarion bus only leaves every half hour , so time it correctly !
neutral	the lesson is , as always , don_'_t promise a service you cannot
neutral	unfortunately i was less_than impressed with the presentation of the serenta trio of ales ' hamper '.
neutral	then i had to pay for the cost of the return which was unexpected .
neutral	although the ordering was simple and delivery was prompt considering it was xmas .
negative	i am not very impressed with the service from ups and their attitude , i arrived an collection time between 00 and 0 today .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
negative	within minutes of accepting order for avon_tyres
neutral	i was surprised that even_though i was ordering them late that evening i could still get them delivered the next_day .
neutral	i bought an ipod_touch that was described as in excellent condition with no faults except a few scratches on the back only to find that the back camera is not working and on inspection there is evidence of water_damage and dried water marks beneath the screen .
positive	so simple , everything as promised , will_definitely use again in the future !
positive	the staff at animed are always happy and polite they do everything they can to help you and never pressure you .
negative	since the reason for cancellation was not a change of heart on my part , but a failure to fulfil on theirs , i took the view that their stated 00 day refund policy did not apply and asked for immediate_refund .
positive	first_class service .
negative	i have now been told that the camber could be out - unlikely to my mind .
positive	if you don_'_t know what is best for your goals just ask them and they will make some recommendations for you .
neutral	i eventually tracked them down via my credit_card company to loco0 ( to be honest i couldn_'_t remember whether i ' d used raileurope , sncf or renfe .
positive	excelelnt service and loyalty_scheme
positive	the website is easy to navigate , the ordering_process is quick and unfussy and e_- mail order confirmations are speedily rec ' d .
neutral	i suspect another £_00 or so .
positive	the pool was lovely and area so peaceful for relaxing .
positive	couldnt_believe_how quick the samples arrived , colour was better_than_expected .
neutral	couldn_'_t change online again and so this went on a couple of times .
positive	will definitely be using again !
neutral	had to get towed to where i was staying in keswick - half a day wasted .
negative	so rather_than use their 00p a minute number , i used a uk number ( 00000_000000 ) supplied by their customer_services department .
negative	i was informed that i had been sent an e_- mail to inform_me of this , only i definitely did not receive any such e_- mail .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending complete_care shop to my friends and colleagues .
positive	fast , efficient delivery
positive	best price i could_find for my old_mobile , package arrived quickly and once i posted back the money was in my account after a few_days .
positive	thankyou .
negative	item was subsequently collected after i complained three_days_later than advised .
neutral	our beautiful new furniture arrived today .
negative	:-(
neutral	order i placed was out of stock - still_waiting for its arrival , mid_january i was told straight_away .
neutral	excellent range of products , generally the prices are really good , but the promotional items aren_'_t as keenly_priced as the supermarkets .
positive	when i advised them of the omission , they immediately forwarded the connector i requested .
positive	i am very happy to continue doing_business with tightsplease .
negative	result ?
negative	cant speak to anyone at bt as i have no phone !
neutral	so telephoned and then told to ring the local depo and given another number .
negative	( but they are dry clean only )
negative	where is the sense in that ?
negative	i sent all evidence , proof about the loss , all the forms , out holiday tickets from virgin , the forms from heathrow concerning the lost bags - these_people will go to the ends of the earth to avoid paying out , and worse than that they will take you money and waste hours of your time filling out stupidly over complicated forms before politely telling you to get lost !
neutral	i was really pleased with how the dresses i ordered looked when they arrived .
negative	waste of money !
neutral	really handy .
neutral	well , yeah , that '_s because i only really shop online for birthday and xmas_pressies and they all fall around the same time of year so it will be in - active until then !
negative	their customer service is so busy that they will never call you back !
positive	the floor is looking really good and will look even better when the job is complete .
positive	i always impress about your dispatch time , never been let_down .
positive	bought items from shower_doctor ltd - items arrived quickly and were exactly as_described .
positive	i love the barbour_jacket and the way it was packed made it special .
positive	i get about £_000 back every year , and it '_s tax free , as it is a discount on purchases .
negative	last time i ordered from chemist_direct , i had to phone again weeks_later .
positive	would use again .
negative	måtte købe en ting i butikken for at få lov at_bestille en lampe der kun kunne købes i butikken men som ikek var hjemme .
negative	apparently it '_s yodel '_s fault - yes they use yodel to deliver .
positive	to navigate around and instant price .
positive	they haves fantastic range , everything you need and very competitively_priced .
neutral	ordered item but was not told it was out of stock until emailed a week_later !
positive	spotted several suppliers advertising the exact_same goods , but these were the cheapest ( why pay more ?).
negative	the customer service is non - existent and the contempt is par_excellence .
neutral	i felt sorry for the mechanic as his day wasted as was mine .
negative	parcel delivered by a surly , scruffy driver from a rusty , dirty van .
positive	i have had issues with ear phones fitting properly but after the information received i think i have purchased the right pair .
positive	would recommend serenata to everyone .
negative	don_'_t trust these people .
negative	please avoid at all costs .
positive	the chrome_plating should protect them from atmospheric problems for a good while , but of course , i '_ve not had the items for long enough to prove or disprove this .
negative	avoid this company like the plague !!!
positive	i have now used fonebank twice over a two year period , both_times selling blackberrys .
negative	' miss xxx ' said i was being rude - no miss xxx , i was frustrated - and i was not rude .
negative	no answer !
positive	the items are looking great .
neutral	i then managed to get through by phone ( woop !)
neutral	customer service stated that they did not know how this could_possibly happen as the flowers had to be checked five times before arriving at destination .
negative	customer service provided me with the tracking_number for royal_mail so apparently the goods have been sent , but neither rm nor my country '_s postal service has any record of it .
neutral	the email was ignored .
negative	also , due to severe eye strain i was getting glasses made up in a hurry .
neutral	everything was great until i upgraded and right now i '_m reserving judgement because something has changed .?
negative	i recieved my order from tennisnuts fine , but i had an item missing ( wristband ) which i was then told it was out of stock .
positive	to be recommended .
negative	they were not delivered on that day either .
positive	i ordered these for a birthday_gift and my friend was absolutely_delighted .
positive	products are an amazingly_low price , delivery doesnt take anywhere_near as long as they state on ordering .
neutral	the choice given asked for the telephone_number i used to book .
neutral	my item took a week to arrive , so overall disappointed although got the product i wanted .
positive	the ordering_process was simple and efficient .
neutral	i was wrong - i wasn_'_t able to do so and have lost out on 0 %_discount this time .
negative	at 0 :_00pm i called to see if the car was ready and was told it would be in an_hour .
positive	will_definitely be using next time
negative	ordered wednesday_evening for delivery saturday for important milestone birthday which i could not attend .
negative	now over 00_hours and no manager has bothered to phone my wife , i have escalated this complaint at 0 . 00pm friday 00th_september to customer operations director mark bond , we have had an_automated_reply_stating they have received our email complaint , not looking good for vodafone !
positive	it was well_wrapped and is just as_described .
negative	less_than 00_hours before delivery was due , i was contacted to say bed was not even in stock .
neutral	i booked car_parking with skypark last night ( 0th_july_0000 ) and i kept checking my email to see if my confirmation_email was there , just so i could print this off in case i need it when parking my car .
positive	could not believe_how efficient the service was even if i did have to pay for a courier to deliver the phones to mazuma ( had to be sure of delivery ).
negative	yeah_right .
negative	am going to stop the service the next time they get it wrong .
negative	since the amazon switch over it has_been dreadful and they have basically destroyed what was once a fantastic service .
positive	i ordered a shower_pump on the monday_morning .
positive	everything_went exactly as i expected .
positive	it '_s always delivered within a couple of days of ordering , the sacks i buy are always very secure and so are the packing boxes .
negative	since then i have phoned debenhams several_times .
positive	i am delighted with the quality and value of the canvas i purchased .
neutral	excess fees for using a credit_card are being eradicated .
negative	had to use the panel as the fitting had already been arranged .
negative	nation then told me that they could not fix this problem for me .
negative	if items run out of stock let customers know within one day , not 00 days .
neutral	when we asked europcar if we could therefore extend by a day , they said it had to be done through rentalcars , or else pay a large_amount to them to do a separate contract .
negative	queried with boohoo how come we had been told our order had been fully shipped , but then were told an item wasn_'_t in stock and wasn_'_t being shipped .
positive	great price , very fast delivery , will use again !
neutral	if they had said on their web_site that delivery would take 00 - 00 days then i would still have ordered from them and would have been happy to give them 0_stars .
positive	i would recommend this company highly to anyone as the service and product are exceptional .
neutral	and it was fine .
negative	many of the hotel descriptions were false .
negative	really disappointed with this service !
neutral	however i received no notification that the print was ready for collection and the print_space staff we ' re rude and impatient when i went to pick_up the print from the shop .
neutral	.
neutral	i think they look really good and i thought they would be easy to wipe_clean , which really helps with a toddler in the house , and was one of the reasons i purchased them , however one chair is now sadly marked after getting washable paint on it which won_'_t come off !
neutral	one cabinet was fine , the other looked like it had been dropped before being packed .
positive	why cant the site rember my address details like other_sites do , so i only have to enter it once then just confrim it hasnt changed with each further order ???
neutral	i trust this is just a blip in otherwise good service from a company i trust .
positive	ability to obtain a lead time for delivery is very useful .
positive	this is the parcel service to use , 000_% success_rate with collection and delivery .
neutral	i wanted to order on - line to get my lenses quickly as my optician can occasionally be a bit_slow and i needed some new lenses for outdoor use over last weekend in predicted poor weather .
negative	they also need to improve their customer service by answering emails and at_least answering phone_calls .
negative	i reported this to groupon and they said it will take 00 working_days for them to investigate at which point i must call them back for the result as they will not call me .
negative	i am not happy item never received
negative	eventually spoke to someone_who seemed more competent who_apologised for the mess that had been made by someone '_s simple mistake - and he reiterated we would receive a final_bill in january , we should ignore the letters and of course our details would under no circumstances be passed to any debt_collectors as it was clearly a mistake made that they had made lots of notes on and would acknowledge every painstaking call for at_least 00 - 00_minutes a time trying to sort_out .
negative	the box it came in was also too deep and with so little packaging it '_s a wonder it arrived intact .
positive	all you do is put a phone in the bag take it to the post_office and get money now u cant get any easier than that !
positive	would visit the site again .
neutral	no card was left in the door to tell me what had happened to my goods .
negative	whilst the owner of the company appears quite ready to spout abuse at people , he clearly doesnt like it when people report the facts of the matter for all to see , accurately & truthfully .
negative	the prescription i have has the numbers 000000 , 00000000000 , fp00ss0000 or another number is 0000000000 .
negative	ordered a tokina lens and after_reading the review forums decided that they must be placing very large orders with their suppliers in order to get such discounts .
negative	i was furious , i had made sure i had stayed in all day , so was not at all impressed .
positive	received item quickly , sooner_than_expected and it was very well_packaged , haven_'_t used it yet so can '_t comment on use , but don_'_t expect any_problems .
positive	ordered goods thursday_morning & recieved friday lunch time awesome fast service & quality products will recommend to everyone .
negative	thank_you trustpilot for the forum .
neutral	treated_like an_idiot when dates were missed ,
neutral	i was also promised delivery between 0 : 00 and 00 : 00 , at 00 : 00 i emailed to ensure there was no problem and didn_'_t receive a reply .
neutral	usually a chicken will last 0 of us for 0 meals but not this one , it was tiny .

neutral	this was very annoying as i was so excited to get the watch .
neutral	i enquired , but was told that they were sorry but it explicity said to add the code blah_blah .
neutral	arrival back from holiday was good and a bus driver was very helpful with advice when i was walking to the reception_area after_discovering i had a flat battery .
positive	colin martin
positive	well_packaged with an_unexpected extra package of sewing accessories .
negative	company is a joke .
neutral	arrived promptly
negative	still no contact and still no replacement vase
neutral	i spend more then 00 in on taxi to finde this plase !!
neutral	alot of it didn_'_t seem to relate to the item .
neutral	had to chase after a few_days after_hearing_nothing , only to be told was vessel was out of stock , that it had just came and , was to be shipped on a 0 - 0 day service .
neutral	happy with the products but whats the point of paying for numerous items or others who pay for next_day delivery if it isn_'_t going to happen ?
positive	the prices are the best that you '_ll find .
positive	the mp0 store is also very convenient and quick .
neutral	will give them a second chance to get it right .
neutral	i thought my tank was empty when in fact the sighting tube and fuel line were blocked , ordered a tank full but obviously when the delivery happened only half a tank could be delivered .
positive	i ordered a couple of packs of lures .
positive	!
neutral	good service but watch the aftersale tactics
positive	i shopped_around on the net and eventually found 0 companies .
neutral	games on there are good but tbh .
positive	!
negative	but noone actually answers either of the phonelines for the depot .
negative	called in again and now the blame game was with city_link the courier being that they have a new software system
neutral	luckily there was one inside so i stuck this on the box myself .
negative	please be careful if you order anything from this website .
positive	delivery was quick and it was well_packaged .
negative	most definitely it is inconvenient situation for everybody .
negative	we are down about £ 0000 !
positive	from watching the videos on line to reading the reviews , i found this service very good .
neutral	took my car in for its mot , it passed but a load of advisory '_s were mentioned so i asked if they could be done the next_day and they said that it could .
negative	royal_mail leaves a card telling you where your package is and how to collect it .
neutral	order acknowledged & then received emails tracking delivery etc .
negative	however at 0 . 00pm i got a phone_call to say there wasn_'_t enough room on the van for it !
positive	item was dispatched same day .
negative	i would never buy anything from them again and urge_anyone considering it to go somewhere_else .
negative	the first time i was annoyed because they made me pay 00 pounds for a replacement sim for my contract .
neutral	plus some of the photos were printed with light grey borders and some weren_'_t - i have no idea why as i didn_'_t consciously choose this as a feature .
positive	great way to make cash from your old books .
positive	half the price of the competitors for the toner i bought , very impressive .
positive	great price and amazing trainers .
negative	they refused , even_though the replacement would have cost us £_000 more .
positive	thank_you monica .
negative	vicki has very kindle agreed to email me today once the credit has_been processed and the credit should be with me within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i requested a new delivery address due to my time_constraints .
neutral	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone i spoke the the same person and he was good enough not to fob me off with the usual " i so sorry " but had no choice but to repeat pixmanias ' position which was " we can '_t do anything until the goods are returned " remember i never even received the cooker .
neutral	great for equipment and product range particularly clothing - however with success and the number of customers i think in the last two years there has_been a reduction in the quality of cservice
positive	my wife is coeliac and often bemoans her gf bread is nowhere_near the taste of " real " bread .
negative	this company lies through there teeth .
negative	rookie error - no pun_intended .
neutral	just a shame with the delivery letting it down .
negative	it was not !
negative	i cannot recommend you to anyone for such lousy service .
neutral	serenata replaced them as soon as i got in touch with them though , sending a fresh bunch on a day of my choosing .
positive	what a refreshing buying experience !
neutral	i did like that the shipper was interlink whom can provide a one hour delivery window via_email and text_message .

neutral	not the best as quite complicated - but good to see my bill online
positive	the sign is very professionaly made and of high_quality .
negative	i had to refund the customers , and parcel_monkey only refunded the original postage cost , even_though i insured bot the missing parcels for £_000 .
positive	had home visit to fit tyres , much more convenient than going to the shop , and no extra_cost .
negative	they claim to have sent me a replacement battery , but i have never received a replacement battery and the bogus tracking_number doesn_'_t work with any provider ( note they didn_'_t provide a courier name !
positive	so much_better_than queueing for hours in the post_office !
neutral	the first lot of flowers were in my opinion sub - standard , but when i told seranata that this was so and sent photos they immediately sent another bouquet without and hesitation .
positive	an excellent range f of beer from a far and at home .
negative	.
negative	disgusting service , unhelpful staff .
negative	also if you look at the dates on trust_pilot the reviews they are all in groups by date so there '_s been quite a lot recently but then none for the previous year then loads so my only conclusion from that is that they wrote some of them at_least themselves obviously only the good ones .
positive	will never look at using another website / store for buying games .
negative	i contacted groupon and was told i have to wait 00 working_days for my item to be re - issued even_though the merchant was willing to do it straight_away if groupon gives the authorization .
positive	i found the leki stick easily , and was impressed to see details before ordering . my parcel arrived quickly , well_wrapped upand protected . all in all a fast and reliable company supplying a quality item .
negative	i fail to see how anyone packing this product would think it was ok to send like this !
neutral	it seemed a task for staff to serve at the various bars .
positive	a very good service what more can i say .
negative	then i saw this site .
negative	and to top it all off , i wrote a post on their facebook_page last night to say that their customer service was poor - when i checked just now , it has_been removed , and i cannot seem to find the facility to enable me to write another post . funny that .
negative	however , had you applied the same percentage discount as you claim was applied to the original rrp of the product to the 0nd_hand unit then that would have been a far more reasonable approach and one possibly worth considering .
neutral	makes me wonder what the fabric content actually is ?
neutral	!
positive	the snapback i bought was really good quality , well_presented in a cool box and came the next_day .
negative	they are a total load of bullshiters and shysters !!
neutral	everything comes with wireless these days - it '_s standard .

neutral	disappointing though - but a good product at a good price
negative	rang to say i would be 00_minutes early and was basically told to forget it by some rude man on a mobile .

positive	thank_you
negative	i have use van mildert online twice and on both_occasions the items arrived in really bad condition . both_times the items looked like they had been packaged by children with no effort and screwed_up .
neutral	also , the vase ordered to put the flowers in was too small - though this was not indicated as a potential problem at the time of ordering ( only one size option of vase ).
negative	for a genuinely nicer experience i shop at independents ( health_food stores ) or waitrose where the price is comparable and the quality and service superior .
positive	as usual , my latest purchase was delivered the next_day [ with free delivery ].
positive	i produced a xxl large book ( a0 size ) and was a little_concerned that the photos might not blow up well but they came out brilliantly .
negative	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .

positive	it was delivered very quickly ( within 00_hours i think ).
negative	they promise one thing but their customer_support is shocking .
positive	i didn_'_t want to go to the bother of drilling new holes in the door for fixing centres , etc .

positive	thanks , dave justice
positive	the rails arrived very promptly , they are easy to construct and most_importantly are very robust as well as excellent value for money .
neutral	however i like the sound of this company from their early beginings and hope they don_'_t ever forget what made them today .
neutral	i was going to order 0 sets of shelves however the delivery costs made this prohibitive , despite the delivery going to the same address .
neutral	good advert for them !
neutral	they failed to explain_why it was " low stock " before placing my order and only changed to " out of stock " after the payment .
negative	!
positive	they turned_up stunning not a single unfresh flower in the bunch was worth getting them upgraded in size .
negative	yes of course they handle so many parcels that sooner or later somebody is going to have an okay experience with yodel , but why are so many having to suffer as i have ?

negative	she just said the delivery office are asking for this info .
positive	i always go to wiggle first .
neutral	at christmas it was part of the service .
neutral	regards ,
negative	the delivery arrives but no pod chair ( or cover for the other set ).
negative	in many cases the shipper has no process for doing this , and it means navigating a complicated path of customer_support at the shipper trying to get them to do this .
neutral	checked the box which was damp from the rain and wet from leakage of water inside .
positive	all in all really excellent service and i will be definitely buying glasses from them again in the future .

positive	could not have been quicker or easier

positive	i would recommend them .
negative	the item was sent by recorded delivery via_royal_mail .
negative	i paid for a next_day am delivery , i didn_'_t get it the next_day ( thursday ) , i patiently_waited for friday , i didn_'_t get it on friday , saturday was the day of the event .

positive	i was not aware of this company before purchasing my printer and came_across it after hunting online and reading some great reviews .
neutral	the price looked straight_forward until i got to the end , then there were a number of add - ons which were not mentioned earlier , such as a booking_fee ?
positive	the flowers were for my nan who_lives about 000_miles from me !

positive	all oakfurnitureland items are made from solid well seasoned timber and each piece is extremely well finished , no rough_edges anywhere .
neutral	i would use loco0 again but just need to be a bit sharper .
positive	the website was very easy to use and good value for money .
negative	- money was refunded on request but this was short of the original amount paid and seemed to me to be much more than i would expect simply due to changes in currency_exchange_rate but when i questioned this i was not able to get to the bottom of the situation and was hugely infuriated by the customer_services staff constantly confusing my booking with another ( this happened on more than 0 occasion ) so have eventually come to the conclusion that i will not get anywhere with them and will have to accept being slightly out of pocket .
negative	that too hasn_'_t happened .
positive	!
positive	i will_definately recommend you to a friend .
negative	thinking this was not an option , i phoned around as many companies as possible and managed to find a company who could do them in such a short time .

positive	order a washer_/ dryer , but they did not have in stock and delivery was going to take 0 - 0_weeks .
positive	would use again
neutral	i can '_t_believe that when you ' re spending close to £ 0000 on a suite , they add delivery on top .
neutral	so i was not impressed .
neutral	after the 0rd time my boots were right but cost me around £_00 in phone_calls !
neutral	i bought this as it was a good deal on a voucher site .

neutral	the fire_alarm went off at 0 . 00am and no body knew what to do , it was over 00_minutes before everyone came out and because of the chaos we ended_up paying for a taxi to get us to the airport .
negative	tracey king
negative	their online and customer service was horrible .

neutral	i will be re - ordering in due course .
neutral	sticking to it rigidly , except i don_'_t always eat the snacks in between .
negative	i never asked for this and had to spend 00_minutes of my time trying to figure_out how to contact them .
negative	customer_services do not know anything about consumer_law .
neutral	buying glasses online can work , if only they didn_’_t mislead customers online !
negative	this caused my pensioner mum lots of stress .
positive	!
negative	what shocked me the most is that i arranged them to contact me regarding my order about a month and a half after_placing it and he just repeated what was in the emails they were sending .
positive	right result !
neutral	i have not contacted lakeland , yet but i '_m certainly wanting a quick and smooth returns process .
positive	i had no problem with them .

neutral	really disappointed as i need a decent pair of glasses for work .
negative	needless to say i have asked for a refund which i am told will take 0 week .
neutral	i sent it straight_away and the next email i had was a week and a bit later saying my payment had been processed .
negative	background :
negative	i paid 00 . 00 for guaranteed saturday service .
negative	very poor service !
negative	when i contacted the site to explain this they emailed am back saying they had confirmed with the company that posted them that a female in her 00s had signed form them at my address .
negative	more recently the pills whatever they are and i '_m really not sure turned from being yellow to being blue ( they might have a bit of zopiclone in them but they are basically fake ).
neutral	the print however is terrific just a pity the customer experience was not !
neutral	why ?
negative	if i hadn_'_t checked my refunds , i would be seriously out of pocket !!
neutral	i ordered on 00 march and my order was confirmed by email the same day .
negative	never happened !
negative	i contacted the garage and they were less_than willing to resolve .
positive	the delivery of the tyres were on time , excellent condition and will use the service again .
negative	worst customer service ever , they say they have no idea or a system regarding their back orders , but they are quick enough to debit my card shocking !!!!
negative	bought an item and had it engraved in same shop after about 0weeks the engraving was becoming illegible so took it back to my home town shop to have it rectified , but the person behind the counter spoke down to me as if i was a child so i sent it off to the head_office on about the 0nd of dec , and complained about the poor service i had received but 0weeks had passed without a reply so i then had to phone them to find out what the delay was and they apologized and said they were very busy but eventually sent me a refund , so from_start to finish and from the bottom to the top of this company i have received a very poor and shoddy service , would i recommend or use this company again no !
negative	can you make them understand without turning into a screaming guest on jeremy kyle ?
negative	when a parcel is lost there is limited help and phone number is a premium_rate number .
negative	as it was a heavy tv bed we needed to pay to get it taken apart .
neutral	this was fine , and i was told that once they had received a delivery they would be sent .
negative	i am sure you already know that you are the worst courier company in the uk ( amazingly beating yodel ) but i '_ve had two deliveries from you now and both were damaged .
positive	thank_you
negative	cannot really judge this company yet as they cannot deliver until beginning of december , so i have to reserve judgement
neutral	i phoned the company and asked if they would both get to me in time for the function i was attending .
positive	while this isn_'_t ideal , i returned the glasses and as it was within their no - quibble timeframe they didn_'_t ask any questions and promptly replaced the lenses and sent them back to me after a week or so .
negative	ethan in particular needs re - educating in customer service .
negative	unfortunately , it would appear that i have ordered the completely wrong
negative	transferered to another department . waited on hold for 00_mins and hung_up .
negative	never got a refund despite 000s of calls .
positive	through car del_mar booked with avis who had a very nice med size toyota_corolla at micro car price
negative	it didn_'_t even contain red_roses !
positive	cheap prices , quick delivery , great service !!
positive	developing our on - line retail service for the sale of our portable wireless alarms for our rural property watch service required a cost - effective and reliable parcel delivery service .

negative	is she paid based_upon the number of times she attempts a delivery ?
positive	would recommend this company
negative	even with an amazon local voucher which gave_me a a £_00 discount , lenson turned_out to be far more_expensive than any other online_retailer
neutral	the delivery was slow on one item but both arrived in the end .
neutral	the spa however were calling me all day friday to make_sure we definitely wanted our appointment for the following_day ( as i later found out that vanessa had called them on the friday_morning to cancel our appointments - even_though i had asked her to do anything of the sort )!
positive	totally reliable - i have bought numerous items from them .
neutral	and then the fact the delivery options were 0_days or 0_weeks was frustrating , as i '_d allowed just over 0_weeks and then found that i had to resort to paying another £ 0 per item , just to get them within the 0 week window i needed .
positive	quick delivery , no_hassle , good product and price
negative	plumbnation refuses to leave items without a signature , even_though i clearly indicated in writing that i would take_responsibility for it .
positive	good customer service and promt delivery even to north_scotland and no surcharge

positive	it was delivered well - packed , on a pallet , and on time as agreed .
neutral	i never have trouble with trousers so i know it wasn_'_t me !

negative	well no , e_- ticket number as well as the booking code they provided were of no use to me .
positive	from making the order to the delivery took just one day , the mountain_equipment coat arrived in perfect_condition and just in time too as the first snow_fall was the following_day .
neutral	they threw in an old dusty drill box for free but nobody ever uses the boxes , that '_s why i ordered a bag with the consignment .
negative	i complained and when we go to the bottom of the misunderstanding i asked them for an_apology - told on the phone they had nothing to apologise for .
positive	i ordered two blinds which were competitively_priced , the blinds arrived within a few_days and are better_than i had anticipated .
negative	looking for somewhere unbiased to leave an honest review i found trustpilot , and posted a review here .
neutral	booked 00 months in advance , car collection could not be better very slick with very pleasant and efficient staff plus very easy process to drop car back off . but our fiat_000 was marked or dented on nearly every panel plus bits of trim missing here and there , it had over 00000 km on the clock and was looking tired , also no cd or map in car as advertised , it went ok but every other person we saw on the island seemed to have a nice clean and shiny car to drive .
negative	what are the children making them getting paid ???
neutral	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .

positive	it is really annoying me now that every time i make an order , i have to repeatedly enter my address and delivery address details ( they are different ) !!!
negative	it was at this point when i realised i needed to get out of here , but we still waited for the rest of our meal .
negative	about a week_later i got an_email from groupon saying they need my email address and phone number to pass to the merchant which i provided ( obviously they already have this and could surely have asked for permission to share details when the complaint was raised ).
negative	i am extremely disappointed and by every occasion i am going to worn people , telling them my story about the situation that argos put me into , just to save them from ending up with nothing because of unreliable and extremely incompetent company - argos !

neutral	came when car audio insisted it was dispatched but heg parcel co . insisted it was not .
negative	not acceptable .

positive	many_thanks .
neutral	the car '_s air_conditioning also didn_'_t work .
positive	excellent quality of service from this company - i emailed them to give my thanks before i received your request for feedback - i have copied my email below :-
neutral	i appreciate that this time of year is always a bit more_expensive but feel 0 roses with a bit of greenery is not really value for money , as i said the presentation of the flowers was good and delivery fine but the size was a bit dissapointing .
positive	the service from buybrandtools . com can not be_faulted .
positive	i ordered a case for my iphone_0c .

neutral	i replied if i '_m returning the wrong item , who will pay for the postage , and suggested a pre_- paid envelop to be arranged , but never_heard from them since then .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t choose to use this particular car_park again .
neutral	however , after waiting more than a week after the yodel web - site claimed to have despatched this consignment , i still have not received the item .
neutral	if i am charged for anything_else i will be expecting a refund .
neutral	was eventually allowed to leave after complaining .
neutral	prices not too bad , website easy enough to use and follow .
positive	i would definitely use them again .
negative	disguisting service , very slow , very rude .
negative	in short , i have not received the item .
negative	obviously this wasn_'_t the fault of house trip , but the issues i had were around :
neutral	the delivery men were very helpful though and i had good service from the staff at the end of the phone .
neutral	this time the items have taken 0_days to dispatch and a further 0_days to ship - overall 0_days from order .

negative	on the plus_side the delivery was very prompt .
negative	there was absolutely no answer when i called to ask about my package .
positive	excellent thanks
positive	always a pleasure to deal with .
positive	so , being sensible i emailed the companies whom i believed had the right products for me .
neutral	the wedding_invitations were excellent when they arrived .
positive	purchased a pair of lowa recce gtx_boots on the 00 / 0 / 00 and received them to the republic of ireland in 0 days which is fairly fast using normal mail .
negative	i '_ve had to go to my bank and register a dispute .
neutral	in short , we '_ve probably spent another £_00 on better fittings , plus still have a problem with the concealed toilet_cistern which leaks , as the fittings don_'_t form a good seal and they ' re a non standard size , so grad to replace .
negative	i had to contact them to find out where item was , they said item had been sold in store on saturday , i bought item on the previous friday .
positive	would buy again
negative	they may very well be useful for simple , self - contained jobs like moving limited numbers of items from one location to the other or acting as couriers , but i am completely unable to recommend anyvan as a company anyone should do_business with at all for removals .
negative	i have ordered elsewhere and they are arriving tomorrow .
negative	phoned customers services at 00 : 00 and was told someone would call back straight_away .
positive	wanted to have flowers delivered to my daughter on her_birthday and delivered before she left for work .

positive	ordered the 0kg_chicken - excellent quality , lean steak_mince , very little water when cooked and the best i '_ve tasted , and 0kg of liquid_egg_whites ideal as i finished them in 0 . 0days , overall great experience , stop buying supermarket_chicken_breasts 0 for £_00 , switch to muscle_food , that is all !
neutral	although website has changed , i '_m not particularly impressed with the search_facility when i searched " yoga " i was told no results , although managed to locate lots of items after quite some time .
positive	even the delivery driver was nice !!
neutral	i did not receive any receipt from a garage , as he told me that i should contact you ( tyre_shopper ) to get it as i paid you , not them .
negative	it is purely and simply false_advertising .
neutral	too many unnecessary changes that are not for the better .
neutral	which also didn_'_t happen .
positive	the genuine lg part that i was looking for is no manufactured .
negative	i phoned customer service and was informed that the pictures were for illusration purposes and were not of the actual item ( you have to ask why_bother then ?)
negative	eventually i replied to one email_stating that i was handing everything over to barclays to recover my money .
neutral	the feedback was a little_disappointing however , the flowers were described as " nice "
neutral	finally , i have read_reviews that raise doubts_about teakwarehouse being a reputable_company because they only accept payment by bank_transfer or cod .
positive	good price .
negative	you are much_better contacting takeaways direct , usually you get better service and quicker delivery by contacting takeaways direct .
negative	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn_'_t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
negative	if that doesn_'_t work i will go through the energy ombudsman to see if they can resolve the issues .
negative	i checked out when it was put back in my basket , only to find out when i got the confirmation_email .
neutral	this was very was very stressful for me with my expectations of bride and groom being high , i was surprised that no one checked the order of service before it was sent out .
negative	but when we finally arrived at the airport we were told curtly by the iceland air representative that the sales_person i ' d spoken to at alpharooms who ' d wished me and my girlfriend ' a happy holiday together ' had booked us several rows apart on all our flights !
positive	great service .
neutral	i order every few_months from child '_s play , maybe more .
neutral	i cannot_believe that in a modern office block there would not be a way or someone_who would be able to gain_access .
neutral	unfortunately , they are given an incentive to review certain games favourably , which really tarnishes ign '_s reputation amongst gamers .
neutral	took files in , disc not accepted - bad
neutral	0 might be seen as still a little_harsh but the original problem still grates .
negative	i definitely will not be using this company ever again .
negative	forget all you read on the website .
negative	however , if the flowers were delivered more than 0_days late , i would be entitled to a refund on delivery cost !
neutral	i was told no .
negative	if i could give no stars , i would have .
negative	!
neutral	buymobilephones of course didn_'_t have any malware or popups that i am aware of but it '_s not a good frontage for a site for first_impressions .

neutral	not as good as it was going down_hill fast , bring back the old crew please at_least they were polite and helpful .
positive	i '_ve had several deals from them .
neutral	i ordered the cream version but received the black one .
positive	they have always been quite helpful and give me good discounts for being a loyal_customer
negative	yes , i got a refund , but this to me is a very unethical way to conduct_business !!
positive	these tiles were really good value , they were delivered quickly and they look great .
negative	you should be consigned to the history books forever .
negative	hermes have failed to deliver my asos parcel four times despite me being at home everyday waiting for the parcel this week .
negative	they could find no trace of my complaint so i had to go through the whole_thing again !!!.
neutral	order tok rather longer to arrive than i expected based on what was said on website . was moved to priority after i spoke to someone on live_chat .
negative	i ordered a petite star njoy bubble grey / black * reworked * a , this was a grade ( a ) pushchair and the website states grade a pushchairs are : returned items that are as ' new ' and un - used .

neutral	interparcel were very slow to respond regarding a claim and it took 0 or 0 phone_calls with them promising to investigate before they actually did .
negative	however , logging in to amazon to try to find out what is going on , i find the order has dissipated ( lucky i printed it or there would be no evidence :-)).
neutral	i ended_up ringing them 0 days_later and they rectified the problem while i was on the phone .
neutral	we then were informed at 0pm that the pilot could not land on the ship but we were to kept_informed .
negative	i went back on to the website and noticed the jacket was still there only they had added an extra £_00 to the price .
negative	when i went to the local_depot , there was a small door resembling a fire_exit for collections ( at_least the entrance for the staff looked nice !).
negative	had a brand_new bmw stolen and they found a little grey_area which i could have never found .
neutral	luckily it does fit well , however a simple email to inform_me of a rough delivery time would '_ve made me happier with my purchase and the process .
neutral	the posy was still beautiful but i am very dissapointed especially for my reasons behind selecting this one .
positive	thanks for good , fast , efficient service .
negative	this is a legal_requirement .
negative	dear_sir /_madam i am disappointed and concerned that this company does not attempt to address or respond to any letters or emails sent .

positive	the tyre was fitted promptly , payment taken - all with efficiency and courtesy .
neutral	i found software very easy to use and the quality of the final product is great .
positive	the prices were extremely good and they arrived within two_days of placing the order .
negative	their web - site claims ' lambdatek started in 0000 ' although the company was established in 0000 - this is easy to check at companies house , and i did so .
positive	i found glasses_direct to be very efficient , and the cost of the glasses were exceptional saving considerable amounts on high_street_optician prices .
neutral	sorry just 0_stars today .
positive	free delivery is also a bonus , especially as it is usually next_day !
neutral	this resulted_in a half an_hour wait in the cold after a very long and tiring journey .

positive	fast delivery - received within a couple of days .
negative	get it sorted please - google gives you a one click and your there .
positive	great prices on the tyres too !
positive	i '_m staying put !
negative	have used them over the last 0 years and any_problems have been sorted_out quickly , usually by a pleasant lady somewhere in london . but now when things go_wrong , you need to speak with an agent somewhere in asia who can speak_english , but can '_t understand it , and just tells you to wait for 00 days for a further reply .
negative	i wanted a vase to go with it thinking it will look better .
positive	all as above .

positive	great product , very well_packaged and speedy delivery
neutral	the item arrived very quickly .
negative	!
neutral	the timescales for submissions and getting it " right " are tight and with absolutely no human_being at p0g to discuss the matter with ( unless i dialled 0000 - err no thanks ), i found the process incredibly_frustrating and certainly not customer friendly .
negative	then they were out of stock in which i wanted so had to get a refund , desperately wanted that outfit and paid next_day delivery !!!
negative	the brand_new item arrived with a fault .
neutral	still_awaiting call back to see if replacement can be made ???????
neutral	ebay - im just waiting for the day when we have a competitor for selling , i do use amazon for most purchases but im not particularly happy with you - and you are very expensive - the feedback protocols are anti sellers too .
positive	i think we are all guilty of leaving the tap running or being in the shower longer_than we should but i did not think of checking the hosepipe outside for leaks / drips .
neutral	so folks - enjoy the food , but get out the magnifying_glass before you cook it !
positive	quality of the coffee excellent .
positive	just a few_clicks and the job is done , if only all web sites were as easy to use .

negative	i checked the parcel tracker service and saw that yodel say they attempted delivery but my address was wrong .
positive	i got just what i ordered , and the badges arrived really quickly too .
negative	if i were a company i would never use them .
negative	it took you one day to debit the money to my card account .
positive	all for 0 quid ?
neutral	delivery i think is too slow by today '_s standard , even_though it is free .
positive	go_electrical were very professional about their service and delivery , when i had a query a very helpful gentleman_named chris followed it up for me , and returned my call as promised , the day of the delivery i received an_email from the courier service confirming time of delivery ( given as 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 ) and the parcel arrived at 00am .
positive	i find chaoscards an excellent site forthe display of cards and very reasonably_priced .

positive	ordered by telephone which was fast & efficient .
positive	i '_m using the heart shapes to decorate little jam_jar tea light holders that i am making for a friend '_s wedding and they look lovely !

negative	my boy has_gone to college in usa and has tried to notify talkmobile that he wished to cancel monthly_contract on numerous_occasions through their internal web email .
neutral	the breakfasts are tasty and i enjoyed them .
positive	it would be useful if p0g had a number you could call - the live_chat was brilliant when i eventually found it though !
negative	ordered for the first time a few_months_ago from my local_store ( torquay ), and the driver forgot to bring up half of my shopping to the door , and just drove_off !
positive	the tricker '_s boots are all i could have wanted and more .
positive	placed an order on the tuesday .
neutral	took 0_days to get key
positive	deliveries are rapid and returns so easy .
positive	not only will it cover me for this trip but it is an annual_policy that will cover me for for a whole year , no matter_how many_times i have car_hire , i just thought you should know as you are also looking at car_hire .
negative	( ou boire le reste ). c ' est ce qu_' on m ' a fait comprendre .
negative	bunch of idiots more like .
neutral	the glasses were not polished , and the box and glasses were dusty - i would have expected £_000 sunglasses which still cost me over_£_000 in the sales to be sent to me in better condition .
negative	soi had no choice but to go to each_individual desk and finally found the car .
positive	i thought i had been sent the wrong product but later found out it was actually my mistake .
negative	when all i wanted to do is sort_out this ridiculous account .

positive	i also like electronics , computers and gadgets !
negative	will go_elsewhere next time .
positive	i knew_exactly_what i wanted and that was exactly_what was delivered and faster_than the expected .
negative	?
neutral	in principle that was fine , and the price ok ( although another courier company such as myhermes . co . uk could have done it for around half the price ), but parcelforce would only give 0am to 0pm collection and delivery time slots .
neutral	thank_you again .
negative	no one could locate where the sunglasses were .
negative	product not yet arrived .
neutral	each repeat order was for two copies .
neutral	when it arrived it was well_packed and there was no damage but windows 0 would not load after several_attempts so i had to do a clean install . since then things have been fine .
neutral	the rating should also be separate for different_areas - bit like ebay : value for money / communication / reliability / politeness / care with goods .
positive	have used this service before and the service continues to be excellent .
neutral	i have placed just one order - due to stock issues i '_m having to wait a few weeks - not too much of a problem in this particular instance - just slightly frustrating .
negative	i booked a collection with yodel00 ( 00 . 00_hours . this is a joke believe me ) for monday .
positive	i wish they were all like this .
negative	today they '_ve finally admitted they can '_t supply .
negative	its such a shame that a relatively reliable company should be let_down by the antics of cartrawler and its car_hire partners .
positive	recipitant was very happy with the flowers she loved them .
negative	requests to be called by me have been ignored and at one point i was told point_blank that nobody would be able to talk to me .
neutral	getting hold of someone to speak to was very tricky - i recommend always selecting ' sales ' if you want to speak to someone on the phone - but when i did , they were incredibly helpful and lovely .
neutral	poor customes care
positive	as far as i remember the postage was very reasonable ( about £ 0 ?)
negative	ordered items .
positive	all have been a waist of time , money and one big hassle and headache .
positive	!
negative	if you are going to purchase from these loonies then i suggest you do it as a person and not a business as you have 0 days to return without_quibble .
positive	i '_m actually quite impressed with the service .
negative	after 0_weeks i spoke to '[ name ]' ( yeah_right ).
negative	the material was inferior , cheap & nasty .
negative	i have called the call_centre multiple_times .

neutral	if this had been pointed_out .
neutral	i sent an_email to the sales_department , and the rep apologized for inconvenience , and is arranging for second chair to be sent out asap .
negative	however using google translator i managed .
neutral	their choice of alcohol was good , ordering and paying online was easy and the e_- mail communications about process and delivery were helpful .
neutral	i have used them a couple of times : great service but they need to be more circumspect in their choice of products and make it clear if they are a discontinued product e . g .

positive	how do beat that for speedy delivery .
neutral	additionally , since it usually takes a minimum of 00 days and sometimes far longer for toys to arrive , i tend not to use this company for birthday_presents since twice i my son has attended a party empty - handed and the present is eventually handed_over long after the party has_been forgotten .
negative	followed up with central customer_services to let them know the £_000 ultrabook i had bought was given to me with a generic power_cable , not the samsung original .

neutral	however on my secound purchase i was charged 0 . 00 delivery charge and had to wait nearly a week for it to arrive which i thought was really poor as i could have bought it somewhere_else for cheaper .
negative	i then spent the next two hours either on hold or finally talking to people who did not have the seniority to help me .
negative	i rang straight back and again after 00mins was cut_off this carried on till i decided enough was enough and stopped calling at 00 : 00_hours .
positive	i was even able to checkout first time .
positive	i was really happy to find brandosa was selling merrell footware normally only available in usa at usa prices .

neutral	the bed was also very difficult to assemble as the bolts for the slats were very tight and took a great deal of head_scratching to work out how to fit them as the holes for the bolts did not line up exactly .

positive	bh0y - 0bny - tjh0 - da0s .
neutral	why did this happen ?
negative	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
neutral	i ordered a full bathroom for over 0k and am happy with the product and the quality .
positive	we have never used a parking company before and this was our first time so we didn_'_t know what to expect .
neutral	i pointed these errors out , and they responded with a second diagram which still contained the original errors , and also had a couple of new errors on it .
negative	kept on hold so long had to hang up .
positive	knowmalaria . com site is easy to navigate and you get hassle_free assessment and choices and delivery next_day .
negative	note that there '_s ostensibly nothing to stop anyone doing this on anyvan .
negative	do not use this company
negative	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
positive	i ordered lunchtime on a sat and it was delivered the next_day on bank_holiday_weekend .
positive	delivered quickly , well_wrapped and cheaper from the brand website directly !
neutral	the flowers that were delivered were perfect i have no_issues with them . my issue is the card , now to everyone it may not mean the same but to me the card is just as important as the actual flowers .
negative	i have complained to you , i have reported you to environmental health but still you do it .
positive	i '_m delighted with this amazing good natured and helpful customer service , willing to bend the rules for me .
neutral	the tapioca_flour i have a harder job finding locally but buying a single item from you is really not a viable option .
neutral	i have ordered an iron on labels a few_years_ago and the print was fantastic .
negative	the offer states the rrp was £_00 . 00 , so when i saw the offer price of £_00 . 00 i snapped it up !
negative	has now filed a defence arguing that as our hard_drive was broken it s worthless " despite the fact thaey had allegedly just fitted £_000 worth of parts !!!
negative	so i don_'_t watch any more .
positive	have already_recommended a few friends and family , to use the service .
positive	i received notification of safe receipt of my goods the day after_posting and payment in my account 0 days_later . great service and better_than some of the ' fly by night ' phone buyers that appear to give you £_00 more but drag their_heels when paying you .
positive	love this site . get all my golf_equipment there :) golfbase . co . uk rocks :)
negative	get a second opinion from an independent if you can . and remember the profits speak for themselves .
positive	will start thinking ab out next year earlier though !
negative	without the beauty of paypal & my quick suspicions i believe i would have been duped too .
negative	i asked to speak to supervisor , told one was not available .
neutral	but anyway the point is that whatever item you need to try and get it in stock within like a week of it being out of stock .
positive	the time taken to receive the goods from the time of order is exceptionally when compared to other_companies operating in australia .
negative	i will not use tesco . com under any circumstances as it freezes my computer , yet i have never had a problem with any other site .
positive	pump has made a big_difference to water pressure in the house .
positive	they were also delivered really quickly .
positive	great and friendly service , prints arrived early
positive	we ordered a personalised_banner and supplied a photo to be included on the banner .
positive	plus , real people to speak to who understand their customers .
neutral	first one in november , when the delivery was changed on a few occasions then when delivery went to end of jan , i had no choice but to cancel the order - after all was meant for a xmas_present !.
negative	called on the monday chap at other end did not seem to be able to operate the computer properly .
negative	i intend to call nespresso on monday and complain_about this appalling company .
positive	excellent service ;)
positive	last one gave delivery window of 0hour .
positive	brilliant hotel and excellent s service from hotel_direct
neutral	they asked me to check if the third tap was in the delivery as the warehouse said they had packed all the taps .
negative	when i told her i wanted a refund , she told me i was not entitled to one and basically ended_up putting the phone down on me .
neutral	ordered gift_voucher and was informed delivery had to be by royal_mail recorded delivery .
neutral	i '_m_sure everything will taste fine , but i was anticipating a bit more .
negative	they claim their phone system is not working , their customer ' service ' agents do not read emails properly and i cannot seem to get a refund .
negative	i '_m so disappointed .
neutral	which they sent a few_days lateall this over a weekend meaning unable to put up shelves for 0 days !
neutral	the ordering_process and the speed was a different matter .
neutral	the box was huge , however the flowers inside were tiny , for £_00 i would expect more .
neutral	i am aware that this is not your fault and this is the only product on the market that will do the job .
negative	awful experience and a very disappointed birthday boy .
negative	i complained to resorthoppa '_s customer_services a couple of weeks ' ago , however , i am waiting for their response - i won_'_t hold my breath .!
neutral	but when i went to the fitting_centre on the day i had booked in ( monday 00th , am ) i was told that i wasn_'_t on the system and they weren_'_t expecting me .
positive	will_definately buy from here in the future .
negative	having posted this review shiply asked trustpilot to verify that we were genuine shiply customers , which we did .
positive	but we was lazy and caught the little train , that runs from old town to new town every twenty mins .
neutral	update_: called them after_submitting the review , the staff who answered my call picked_up quickly , went through basic confirmation , and said he '_ll process my replacement right away and have it dispatched either today or latest by tomorrow .
negative	but citylink - come on .
neutral	thank_you
negative	i received a confirmation_email assuring_me my frontline for cats would arrive by second class postage after the 00th .
neutral	this is way outside the delivery times on your website which i have paid £ 0 . 00 for .
neutral	no reply .
negative	will stick to amazon in the future .
negative	this was last time .
positive	a very quick delivery
positive	i fitted in on friday_afternoon and we thought it looked very nice .
positive	i was recommended by a friend who had used watchfinder .
positive	i ordered a mueller ' the one ' ankle_brace for my son and shortly_afterwards received a call explaining that the size i had ordered was out if stock .
positive	i ' d never go_anywhere_else for tyres .
negative	if you ring up you have to wait up to 0 / 0 hour at_least before you can speak with some one . i have never been treated this way by any company i have delt_with and i will never use this company again .
positive	two excellent things about jules_b :
neutral	easy process to scan and send items but 0_weeks from placing order to receiving cash is too long .
neutral	i am not impressed !
positive	happy with the service , mazuma make it easy and hassle_free , and pay on time .
positive	i emailed them with a question and they got back to me straight_away !
positive	everything you promise to your customers you follow through with !
negative	( now 0th_jan !!)
neutral	0_stars for wae competitive_prices and ability to solve my problem though .
neutral	previously had faultless service .
positive	had the best price for what i wanted and i opted for the free delivery but my parcel was with me within 0_days .
neutral	i hope this is not damaging my machine as i will have no comeback from nespresso under my guarantee .
negative	i explained that i needed the phone to work so i could be in contact with my sister ( i explained she was 00 and that our mother had died ), and his response was ' well if you care about your sister so much why don_'_t you pay the bill then it wont_be blocked '.
neutral	it was not finished well and will have to make adjustments to it to make it look ok
neutral	even in the shop one can buy 00 cans of beer for less_than 00 small bottles of water .
neutral	the computer itself is all i can of hoped for however , my buying experience was not .
negative	come on .
negative	on 00th_april i received an_email_stating that my order status was ' awaiting fulfilment ' ( this basically means payment has_been accepted ), but no delivery .
neutral	whilst i understand that eurofit were not_necessarily responsible for the delay in delivery , i would have thought that they would keep an eye on if things as the item was ' traceable '.
neutral	i am unable to claim my £_00 discount_code , trying many_times to contact them but received no responses so far .
neutral	the support contact was very helpful and was just offering to send a new one when i spotted my mistake .
positive	the goods were well_packed and arrived promptly .
neutral	still , the whole_process wasn_'_t too bad and the follow - up work done by the solicitors has_been very good .
negative	after a further two_weeks - the course started next week - still no package had arrived - or no invoice .
positive	such a relief to know i , ve found a solution to my problem .
negative	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
neutral	i have bought from national_tyres several_times in the past .
neutral	no communication at all , not even an_email to tell me when to expect delivery or when item had been dispatched .
negative	i would have liked to review the quality of the flowers but my order never arrived the tracking_system said they were out for delivery and could arrive any time up to 0pm so wheh this all fell through i had no time to find any alternative .
negative	now they have simply cancelled my order as a ' delivery failure ' and i am waiting to get my money back .
positive	very happy with the costume i ordered .
positive	very impressed posted my phone at 00 . 00am wednesday and the money was in my bank by 0pm thursday ,
negative	need i say more ?
negative	you then sit and wait for your order to be taken .
neutral	this is play '_s fault .
positive	for the money you spend on nice clothes it would be nice to have the in store experience through your door , still picking and packing is time_consuming i '_m_sure - just a bit more brand love please !
negative	… that was my first and last dealing_with ballicom
negative	groupon would not take any responsibility for this .
neutral	had problems with plaqcing order due to bugs in the website , received a short delivery , but in both_cases an email got a fast response and solved the problems .
positive	i thought i would wait a few weeks before review to see how they wear .
negative	more generally and on top of the above i have noticed that sainsburys constantly use incorrect ' comparison ' prices ( price per kg etc ) on labels .
negative	i was very frustrated to find that , having chosen all the possible insurance options , there was another substantial daily premium to pay at pick - up , to eliminate the thousand_pound excess .
positive	very impressive service .
positive	great quick service .
neutral	goods are late or get lost ; damart doesn_'_t tell you whether items are in stock or not ( or the info is wrong ); they don_'_t send a message to tell you that goods or dispatched or when you can expect them .
neutral	if they can sort it out by the end of the day they will have redeemed_themselves somewhat , but i '_m really not impressed .
negative	sometimes they offer cheaper rates than other_sites .
neutral	the only_gripe is that in recent years the motorbikes have always been left till last for boarding - and this year for some odd reason at newcastle we were boarded 0 bikes at a time with long gaps between , even_though we were all going onto the same deck it '_s really frustrating .
positive	delivered when they were supposed to .
neutral	drivers seatbelt was stuck in highest position causing wife inconvenience plus hubby as he had to do most of driving because if it .
positive	the first one was £_00 total , i took it , slightly_worried i might get poor service .
neutral	easy to follow web_site but irritating only being_able to look at one date at a time on a chosen route to compare_prices and choose a day of travel , having to go back and re enter details each time is time_consuming .
positive	i had previously purchased a " sock " type night support which proved uncomfortable , hot and not especially effective .
negative	as it hadnt arrived by the 00th_december i checked my account and to my surprise , it stated that this item had been delivered to my home on 00th_december which was a sunday .
neutral	this put doubt in my mind as to whether i had actually ordered them or not - concerned as i needed them asap for a birthday_present .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 ( lower marsh branch , waterloo , london )
positive	our prime_oak_worktops look truly stunning and we would highly_recommend that you check out worktop_express for price , quality and choice .
negative	no was the answer they would not !
negative	parking_facilities excellent .
positive	problem with delivery and as soon as i called it was sorted within 00_minutes !
neutral	0 . 0 hours_later i followed up on my query and was then informed that i now have to wait up to 00_hours for their assessment team to decide_whether they agree with me about the imperfections .
negative	glasses received quickly but they are mis shapen and as i need them not really practical to return .
neutral	trouble is the quantity doesn_'_t match the quality .
positive	my doubts disappeared as soon as the staff at age_partnership contacted me .
neutral	maybe they don_'_t want to give that away to a complaining customer !
negative	since i would soon be travelling_abroad , i decided to hand over my contact details to them for more information about membership in the future , which turned_out to be my biggest mistake .
neutral	i have found that the sticks are not as strong as they were previously .
positive	would use again and highly_recommend ,
neutral	i needed something urgent for the weekend and it was thursday , so i called the vendor and he assured me it would be sent out strait_away .
negative	customer service do not have any idea when normal service will be resumed they told me i would just have to be patient !!!!!
positive	the product arrived in perfect_condition , within the deadline .
neutral	engaged them for a homebuyers survey .
negative	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
neutral	sadly took over a week to arrive .
neutral	i do get a lot of emails from groupon ( at_least 0 a day , sometimes up to 0 ).
negative	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
negative	they received them on time .
negative	not a very cleaver or helpful use of this driver ’_s time .
negative	we also bought a spaghetti_bolognese it also had bones in the sauce .
neutral	i am pleased with my battery_operated tea lights but they do flicker much_quicker_than i would have liked .
positive	hadn_'_t made a strings_direct order for a few_years , still as good as it was last time i ordered .
neutral	on the 0nd order 0 out of 0 items delivered were faulty .
negative	i think it is a disgrace to charge £_00 . 00 delivery to scotland for one tiny key and be free in england and wales .
positive	second to none !
neutral	i am delighted with lightweight as i have a bad back myself and i am registered_disabled .
positive	they were delivered within a couple of days of ordering as well .
positive	i always use cheap_smells for fragrance and beauty products .
negative	i had my baby registry at babies r_us in the u . k , and everything was fine with it .
neutral	we survived on a few snacks and probably had 0 - 0 good nights at our destination on what we saved .
negative	nie wieder werde ih mit dieser firma irgendetwas zu tun haben .
neutral	quite obvious to me but it '_s more underhanded work which would catch out the less observant of us .
positive	i found the service very straight_forward to use .
negative	( 0 years previous address ( great service ) . 0 years current address ) current home was intitially british_gas which i thought i '_d switch back to scottish_power
positive	very impressed with the pricing , advice and speed of dispatch .
positive	we went into marks_electrical last saturday to look at ovens , found one we liked and after checking it would fit in our kitchen , went back and ordered it .
neutral	further to this the booking_fee is a bit much so i would always look for same hostels on hostelbookers .
positive	don_'_t think i '_ll buy glasses from any where else from now on .
positive	i had literally just tried on a pair i shadestation that were reduced to £_000 .
neutral	first time of wearing a seem has come_undone and required repairing .
neutral	can '_t say it was the fact but a bit of a convenience for them so have learnt lesson and will keep an eye on this in future if i use again but apart_from that the deliver was fine and iteam arrived the good thing is u do get an email to confirm the exact date of delivery were most just get an email_saying despatch but no exact date
positive	my money was deposited in my account quicker_than i thought and through my experience it would appear mazuma is a very well_organised and professional_organisation .
positive	great site .
neutral	in my mind then it shouldnt be offered !
neutral	a further 0 day delay on receiving my order .
positive	really good product , excellent value for money and great service
neutral	bom fiquei_muito satisfeito_com o preço para a bota millet davai por u $_000 . 00 , efetuei a compra e transcorreu tudo da melhor forma e após dias de espera sou informado que não entregariam no brasil por questões de alfandega , sugeri um endereço na italia pois tenho um amigo que mora em trento , e mesmo assim minha compra foi cancela e a bota passou a custar u $_000 . 00 , foi uma decepção muito grande pois agora nem o preço esta bom para compra , então espero que no futuro comuniquem onde realmente são feitas entregas antes que seja feita a compra pois é_muito desgastante esta situação , o site é_muito_bom e confiavel , o_atendimento excelente porem neste ponto fiquei_muito chateado e por ultimo gostaria de saber se vcs fazem entregas na italia ok . atenciosamente - paulo .
neutral	the 0nd tour_guide was not prepared to let the bus leave like this .
neutral	!
positive	dpd delivered the package and it came with some of the cables insulation damaged , wire thankfully still intact .
negative	i had calculated that there was going to be a bank_holiday but this date would give me enough food for my little sick dog to cover a short delay .
negative	dreadful company .
negative	after ordering a pair of expensive headphone from them , less_than 00_minutes later i realised they were the wrong ones , despite the description saying differently .
positive	so , i had little choice who to order from , however i am very happy that i stumbled_across this site !
neutral	not entirely_satisfied with this service .
neutral	so overall i '_m satisfied with this excerience .
neutral	i know the comments on the website stated there might be a few subsitutes due to which flowers are in season and availability .
negative	take my advice - go to a high_street shop and save_money and time .
neutral	they take zero responsibility for the service they provide .
neutral	i called up to rectify the problem and there was no explanation for what had gone wrong or any apologies or discount .
neutral	hi
positive	all items arrive very quickly 00 / 00
negative	they just called me today and all they wanted was pushing me to buy content insurance for my home !

neutral	will know more as i use this firm .

neutral	just make_sure you know the delivery of your tyres to the fitter .
negative	row a - b - c - d - e , have all been taken out .
neutral	0_stars for roses - 0_star for delivery as it was right day .
neutral	buy regularly from simply_supplements and my only_criticism is that on three occasions delivery took 0_days for goods to arrive when it should only take 0_days .
positive	it was admired_by so many people that i have placed a new order on behalf of a relative .
neutral	i had to pull everything out on the doorstep before the delivery driver could leave .

negative	i bought a mobile_phone from cash_generator and it was filled with explicit pictures and videos .
negative	both_times , i tried to make the payment through paypal ( because bravofly charge_extortionate_fees for visa cards - £ 0 . 00 ).

positive	user_friendly website with an_extensive_range of excellent products at very low_prices .
neutral	i don_'_t know why the rest of the order couldn_'_t have been sent anyway .
negative	as both my husband and i were at work that day , unless a burglar broke in , signed for a delivery , then left without stealing anything ( except for the order ), then this was impossible .
positive	i didn_'_t think you could get this much power and performance from a re - chargeable vacuum_cleaner .
negative	they also added that i wouldn_'_t be charged for this re - print ( how nice of them to not charge me twice for one book ).
negative	i would give trustpilot a zero_star_review if i was able but unfortunately i cannot .

negative	0 times is not a coincidence - it makes me think that it is done on purpose .
neutral	at 0 . 00pm i got through and driver said he would deliver next_day but couldn_'_t give time or even morning or afternoon delivery .
negative	they then refused to produce insurance documentation after i pointed_out damage after the move had taken place , stating that " it was no_longer any of their business " and that i had raised this too late ( 0_weeks after the move , promptly upon discovery of the damage - anyone who has moved_house knows it takes a fair while to unpack everything ).
negative	we paid scottish_power by direct_debit and built a credit balance of £_000 by the time we changed .
neutral	i am a first time user of tyre_shopper , initially found site ok found prices good , so decided to place an order .

negative	i would like to complain_about the service i have received and am continuing to receive from your company re the above order .
positive	excellent service , now if they only stocked the dba echo dream 0 they ' d be perfect !

negative	i have complained to o0 and thankfully they are very very concerned_about this driver ’_s behaviour and the company '_s attitude_towards one of their valued_customers .

positive	tried some shops in town but no hard_drives .
positive	0_stars are given on price and delivery time only at the moment .
negative	on opening the parcel i was disappointed with the quality of the product as i couldn [ t open quite a few of the drawers .
positive	we all complain_about energy_bills and why shouldn_'_t we but the water charge gives you real value for money in conparison .
negative	i only give one star as the system doesn_'_t allow you to leave zero .
neutral	perhaps i '_ve been lucky , but i suspect this company is fairly small and can '_t cope with the demand .
positive	having bought 0zars stools last_year , we ordered a 0rd despite the original 0 showing a degree of wear , as they were comfortable and stylish .
negative	all of the money was still deducted from my account .
positive	a big_thumbs_up and highly_recommended .

negative	admin assistant
negative	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay away .
neutral	now , in the past , though tickets were not refundable they could be carried forward , as long as they were used within the year .
neutral	they say order is dispatched so they can legally take the money from your card , but has it really been dispatched ???
negative	get the card right and you '_ll get a good review
positive	every time i sat down it pinched my bottom .

neutral	but only if you have bloody good tyres !
neutral	i should like your labelling system to be simplified .
positive	excellent service , item was exactly_what we wanted , it arrived very quickly we are delighted and would not_hesitate to order again .
neutral	there was little else to do , very likely because it was mid - week so we weren_'_t too bothered , but will just be prepared with some dvds next time : d
neutral	it would therefore be helpful if information on drop - off outside office hours could be included in rentalcar website .
negative	the driver totally_ignored my advice and drove down .
neutral	i told them the delivery address but they had to call to confirm , i missed the call and had to call back . long wait .

positive	definitely using this site again !
positive	i got it within 00_hours .
positive	phone is insured straight_away .
negative	as i drove home i realised that i had focused vision only in front of me and simple_task of negotiating round abouts and looking in the side mirrors with blurred_vision was impossible and i had to turn my head round so much that my neck started hurting me .

negative	terrible .
positive	very impressed with your product descriptions .
positive	the machine was delivered when they said it would and fitted with packaging removed would definitely use again
negative	surely such a company would have more staff to answer the phone or emails on what is surely their busiest day of the year ?
positive	it saves us all time , troubling traffic and money .
negative	hi again just to update everone on batteriesplus . co . uk
positive	i made a horrible mistake and went initially to some cowboy_outfit called ' rpc recycle ' simply as i thought i was going to be getting the most for my phone .
negative	disgusting service :
positive	good quality product .
positive	i love this shop , they had things that i couldn_'_t find in stock anywhere_else and at good prices .
positive	i selected the item i wanted , i then went thru the simple checkout system and paid for it and 0 days_later i recieved it - perfect !
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to j . bowles @ parcel0go . com in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning 0000 0000000 this may cost 00p_per_minute .
negative	i bought the three_seater electric recliner sofa and chair after_spending much time deliberating in the shop - the most expensive there .

negative	i followed the location map on the home page link in the confirmation_email to find where i should meet the cruise boat and found that , although i was there in plenty time , the boat did not leave from that location .
positive	this one looks old - school and understated - will go perfectly with plain black santini bib_shorts .
positive	the next_day i called customer_services who answered quickly and courtiously and confirmed it had gone_through .
negative	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .
negative	anyone not colour - blind would have agreed .
positive	items received are packaged well and there are never any quibbles about returns or exchanges and if items do need to be returned money is refunded immediately .

negative	the unit was brand_new and as we did not have a use for it we decided to send it sell it through many of the recycling_sites out there .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for a refund from these jokers .
negative	unfortunately as soon as you spend over_$_00 or equivalent in gbp ( i am an english customer ) the website automatically takes away the option for the cheapest delivery , so the extra you pay for shipping , you do not save anything , it actually costs you more .
neutral	in the end however the mechanic who carried_out the work on my car remembered a misplaced wheel weight and there were no further problems .
positive	all extremely efficient and simple .
positive	recently tried to book with a competitor ( if you could call them that !)
negative	don_'_t get me wrong i really liked being an e . on customer .

neutral	found a very competitive price and the site was easy to use .
negative	when an important parcel wasn_'_t collected by ups i felt_like interparcel were of the opinion it wasnt their issue .

positive	one of the cheapest for my product .
negative	i have emailed serenata 0 times leaving both my email address & telephone_number .

positive	easy website to work through , good specialist products , quoted 0 day delivery but got next_day .
positive	it was delivered safely and quickly - job_done .
negative	then the c_** ts had the nerve to say ' hopefully next time you shop with us , you '_ll choose tracked ' lets just wind back here , they made no effort to sort it out , just told me to leave , didnt even offer anything for complimentary purposes , no cash_back , no free item .

positive	will happily shop at surfmountaiun again .
neutral	on 00 / 0 / 00 i ordered some dog_food and chews for my dog .
neutral	of course , the call never comes so i call in again and again until i fond someone_who_cares enough to help .
positive	i cannot_fault the service or products in any way and will heartily_recommended without_reservation to anyone .
neutral	the furniture arrived promptly with some minimal damage , not caused_by delivery men , and shelf_supports missing .
negative	i had to go to their holding company '_s agm to get the contract cancelled .
negative	their courier company did not collect for days , and i had to do most of the running around to try to get the correct items to site .
neutral	not the best start to a trip and certainly not meet and greet , as i view it .
positive	it was very easy to change ( i '_m just an ordinary householder / handyman ) and it worked like a dream from the word go , plus the added_bonus of a 0 year_guarantee .
positive	very happy with the products although the free t - shirt looks like it is for a woman rather_than a man .
negative	multiple scratches and marks when it arrived .
neutral	he couldn_'_t get it to give hot_water , so paid him for fitting and had to then get mira engineer in , after replacing 0 bits and fiddling around with the workings , engineer eventually got it working , obviously no charge .
negative	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
negative	very disappointing and actually very upsetting .
positive	because we were doing things a bit differant , this allowed_us to taylor the invites
neutral	although the brush_heads were a great price it seems that this is because they are of inferior quality .
positive	speedy delivery of a good product well_packed and arrived in good order .
neutral	not a good use of hard_earned_money these days !
positive	i '_ve been making purchases from green man gaming ( gmg ) for a few_years_now , pc games / dlc .
neutral	apart_from a few remarks from the shop assistant about daughter # 0s slim feet ( after trying several_pairs of boots ) ie why did she not have her own boots ?
neutral	however wanted spare grills etc for my old one which i will give to my daughter and have made three phone_calls to them giving them the part nos etc .

positive	ordered at 00 : 00 arrived by 0 the next_day , what more can i say
positive	a satisfied_customer
negative	!
positive	!
negative	so i had to call and amend the arrival time by phone , as it couldn_'_t be changed online .
neutral	i would order from them again - but insist on the 0st phone_call rather_than the 0th .
negative	the recent change of ownership seems to have marked a deterioration in their service .
negative	after waiting until_0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
negative	have you read all their t &_cs ?
neutral	also no knife_block , only five large dinner_plates when the cottage sleeps six and to be honest the crockery looked cheap and not really fitting with a so called platinum house .
positive	i then went to mamma .
neutral	good rate of exchange for pounds to euros but having placed the order on wednesday , transferred the money within minutes of receiving the confirmation on wednesday , had to chase them on friday to find out why the order was still sitting in pending , awaiting funds .
neutral	we arrived at europcar with the only documentation you had sent us when we booked .
negative	waited in all day for a guaranteed next_day delivery ( 0am - 0pm ) and the idiot from yodel . co . uk didn_'_t bother delivering despite having my goods on his_van .
positive	will be using again .
negative	i used asda direct , click and collect .
neutral	products were all good , but exchanges are a real pain .
positive	my oldish nokia classic stopped_working ( water_damage i think ).
positive	their customer service is excellent .
neutral	when k is on duty i switch off chat and just concentrate on the games !
negative	ordered a bag which was in stck .
negative	charlotte
neutral	of course , their customer service team only work from 00am to 0pm whilst their customers are potentially still_waiting for their goods .
positive	all you should expect - helpful , prompt service .
positive	smooth and fast transaction .
positive	such fast shipping for a good price .
positive	very competitive_prices and fast delivery .
positive	the company always kept me informed of dispatch , delivery and return status .
neutral	i am a regular contact_lens user but i felt there should have been some information on that front !
negative	finally they call me back and say it was changed on the 00th_march and i was emailed but sent to . co . uk rather_than . com - just checked and either domain works so now feel not only poor customer service but tells lies as well !!
positive	would recommend to meat fiends like myself
negative	no shower delivered .
neutral	there didn_'_t seem to be as many flowers as i was expecting despite it being a large bouquet .
negative	they describe it as being natural looking , which it isn_'_t as it is very shimmery .
negative	read the other reviews , they do not hold stock , their communications are non_existent , and they couldn_'_t care a hoot .
neutral	0 .
negative	was messed_around with dates for delivery , website wasnt working_properly , finally ordered and a simple basic white bathroom_suite wasnt cheap , but ordered .
positive	i placed my order on friday_afternoon and was a little_worried that due to the weekend it '_ll arrive late ( as i needed it for valentines_day ) but to my surprise it arrived monday_morning .
negative	they have even used excuses such as ' our customer_services team has just moved from spain to england so things are taking a bit longer ', which was a lie because in the phone_call prior to that the woman said customer_services were in the next room to her !
positive	they were wrapped up with plenty of bubble - wrap so i can '_t understand_why they were damaged , unless they were damaged before being despatched , as it wouldn_'_t be noticed before packed as the tins had the pedigree labelling around them , so possibly wouldn_'_t be seen !
neutral	received my order in a post_office plastic_bag because the box goods arrived here in was soaking_wet or so i thought .
neutral	they probably are very accurately_described - perhaps my standards are too high .
negative	on receiving the glasses , it was obvious the information given to me was incorrect .
positive	b_& q had held no stock of the old seals .
neutral	there isn_'_t enough room to play with to distinguish , score - wise .
negative	the substitution was the healthy option !
negative	one long ( over 0 + hr ) stressful call - funnily_enough to the same ( seemingly competent ) person we were categorically promised that this would be sorted straight_away .
neutral	i would use the service again but next time , i hope they have fixed the problem with their software .
neutral	we have been buying from dobies for several_years , one year we went to someone cheaper , but they were not such good quality , and went back to dobies the next year .

positive	well happy :)
negative	i ordered a dining_room set from their diningroomworld site .
negative	my accident was very recent .
neutral	i paid an extra 00 euro for upgrade which in itself was not expensive i was annoyed that you would even consider a fiat_000 for 0 people , a joke !
positive	nang item , fast delivery .
neutral	telephoned support , only to be told someone would ring me back today or tomorrow , as the lines were busy .
positive	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else fort trophies and awards .

negative	you should get credited within the next 00hours .
positive	thank_you very much for your speedy delivery .
neutral	would shop_here again if prices were competitive
neutral	good customer service friendly and helpful .
positive	i cannot recommend them any more highly .
neutral	when i phone to ask a question i get fobbed_off , given some rubbish fake technical answer or told that the expert will call me .
negative	!
neutral	paul from dawson '_s actually called last_week and was an excellent example of what great customer_care should be .
negative	they then asked for my bank_statement as they couldnt find my payment even_though my bank confirmed they had cashed my cheque shortly_after i paid them .
neutral	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
negative	totally_unacceptable !
negative	this is the first time i have used eflorist and will probably be the last !
positive	looked around for a reasonably_priced oven , this site had a wide_choice st the best prices and were able to deliver quickly .
neutral	the reason for this is that i have a very busy life and i have bigger things to worry_about and better ways to spend my time than making complaints about a sub - standard bunch of flowers .
positive	superb value for money and the service is second to none .
neutral	next_day by 0 o ' clock nothing had been heard and after 00_minutes trying to get through to the correct department we gave up and left a note in the window to leave the item with a neighbour .
positive	bought 0 pairs of prescription_sunglasses , very easy transaction , website simple to follow and glasses arrived as emails suggested within 00 days .
neutral	but i got another set of glasses and they ordered the original glasses i wanted .
neutral	if i need some more shower_seals i will use this company again but i will not be recommending their courier .
positive	immediate sending and delivery of what i needed
positive	after years of being_ripped_off by companies selling printer_ink , i have now found a friendly uk seller who is very helpful , quick delivery and not expensive , at all !
positive	i wasn_'_t sure what the numbers meant , so after some discussion with the member of staff looking at my old lenses i decided to go with the slightly - thinner - than - standard lenses .
positive	best price going on the eastcoast acoustic_amp and quality cables at good price too .
positive	i thought it was easy and the money was in my account very quick .
negative	i requested the fresh flowers - just hope they arrive !
neutral	it turned_out that it was the same company tanker which delivered my boilerjuice oil , as delivered all the other villagers ' orders , at the same time , except cheaper for them !
neutral	i also had to spend some time screwing on all the drawer_handles .
neutral	first item arrived but am still_waiting for the second .
negative	dan
negative	we own our business and paid them for advertising that is all .
neutral	in the event no accidents so no issues , but the whole push to sell insurance did leave a bad_taste in my mouth .
negative	i have also experienced really bad customer service from superfi .
negative	as documented in various_forums ( just google ' homefiresides '), this company is completely fraudulent !!
neutral	shame as i would use you more often if the postage was more competitive
positive	service very good , and very helpful ,
positive	excellent and easy to use !
neutral	easy way to get_rid of old or none working phones
negative	even the manager of the store where we bought our sofa ( who we had to visit after our frustrations in getting through to customer service on the phone ) admitted that he is frustrated that the quality of after sales customer service does not back up the front line sales_staff .
neutral	i then had a painstaking wait to find out whether my evidence for each section had been accepted .
neutral	unfortunately dsl do not have the same customer service values and failed to deliver , failed to communicate_effectively , failed to call back , failed to prioritise resolution of the problem .
negative	the charge for returning was a further £_00 !!!
negative	0st attempt - courier didn_'_t turn_up
positive	i have been purchasing products from amazon for almost a year and they have never disappointed .
positive	i was impressed by the quality of information available and the speed of transaction
positive	it was also the lowest_price when i searched using google_shopping .
neutral	also had message from scrappa ( because i meant to post another mobile_phone worth £_000 ), saying if i want to send another , it is strongly advice to post in for myself using recorded sign for post_office postage as they do not take anymore responsibility for prepaid 00hrs track postage which they send me .
negative	orange said that they have unlocked my phone which they have not and i finally got through to the ee tech department the other day who confirmed it hadn_'_t been unlocked .
negative	i had not received any advice to say this was the case , were they seriously going to keep my money til january and keep_fobbing_me off ?
neutral	didn_'_t stop for breakfast has had an early flight , so up and off to the airport using the hotels transfer service , which was very efficient , unfortunately can '_t say the same for the return transfer pick_up .
neutral	so last century and customer un - friendly .
positive	ordered them sunday & had them delivered free on the thursday !!
neutral	the service provided was very good and i was regularly kept infomred regarding the progress of my order .
positive	everything arrived on time and as_described .
neutral	the flowers are absolutely_beautiful .
positive	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
positive	would not_hesitate in using them again .
neutral	we were travelling with two children - its a long journey to keep them happy and entertained .
neutral	eventually found one .
neutral	eventually the order was placed with a week or so before we travelled abroad so i was confident that they would arrive on time ( again previous suppliers have turned round in a week ).
neutral	not there one .
neutral	i confirmed at this time that they definitely had the correct version in stock and was assured they did .
positive	excellent
negative	i received the request for a review , but i haven_'_t received my order yet :)
negative	contacted these_guys for a quote for my 00 ford transit front_bumper assembly .
neutral	cashback regularly doesn_'_t track , and if it does , is subject to months of delays .
negative	i have just spent £_000 with tyre_shopper on four premium avon_tyres
negative	i purchased a portable_dvd_player for my sister to put in her car for my niece .
neutral	the tank size was only 00 litres !
neutral	this was my first order with the whisky_exchange .
negative	after 0 days i enquired where my refund was .
neutral	this is confusing for someone_who booked online and of course my home telephone_number was not recognised by the system .
neutral	nothing arrived so checked the website tracking for citylink where it had changed to delivery on the friday between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
positive	sourced two tyres at £_000 was happy but then saw tyre_shopper and got them for £_00 .
positive	they may be slightly more_expensive on some items but overall very competitive .
neutral	the ordering and delivery service was good as always , but the quality of the handles was not as good as expected for the price .
positive	i know from research that the range and prices are also good .
negative	i '_ve just waited 00_minutes on their customer service line with no one answering .
neutral	on occassions the parcel has not been picked_up from us , and when phoned the staff have not been very helpfull .
negative	the man i spoke to advised that the address was wrong , and they are now going to be delivering them to the correct_address .
neutral	the people at speedy_registrations were really helpful and within a couple of weeks the plate was on my car .
neutral	dieppe seaways seemed to be quite an old boat , certainly not as swish as the ones on the dunkirk crossing .
neutral	the pool was relatively new and well_maintained and the garden had 0 sun_loungers and 0 parasols .
positive	needed replacement bulbs for my kitchen under_cupboard lights .
neutral	they printed of the necessary instructions and showed me how to use the product safely . i now look_forward to using the mandolin with confidence .
negative	these are the people who give masterclasses in deviousness ( skilful use of underhand tactics to achieve goals ) to the rest of the airline industry !
neutral	i did receive a refund but my quests is : " why not let customers know prior to wasting time trying to buy something which cannot be shipped ?"
negative	well what can i say !!
neutral	i had to make my order £_00 to be able to
positive	thank_you !
negative	do not use this company
negative	scammers
positive	cannot_fault my order , thanks very much .
neutral	it seems their order system hadn_'_t worked properly , didn_'_t go to visa secure check .
positive	products arrived on promptly and did the job just as_described .
negative	the mere fact that they also give you reduced items is rediculous as well , dates were also terrible and required me to eat everything within 0 - 0 days lol !
neutral	however once you have picked your preferred hotel on the other_sites , it is often worth_checking for that hotel specifically by name on hotel . info as the price is very often lower !
negative	never again order online paid for saterday delivery waited all day nothing , then suspect postman stole on monday then about 00_hours of emails and calls to talk to someone sensible that refunded
positive	easy to order and came very quickly .
negative	avoid this company like the plague .
negative	!
negative	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn_’_t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance_department .
negative	this was done but there is some problem with the funds and i am still_waiting for them to clear into my account
positive	highly recomened .
neutral	because the co - op reduced my credit to £_000 .
positive	really great fast , reliable internet sales service offering outstanding value on a wide_range of good combined with an excellent courier service keeping_me informed every_step of the way to delivery at my door .
negative	the second kept comi g up with message_saying problem processing payment and gave a number to call .
neutral	i was a premium member but i am now in a quandary as the artwork is still not good enough even_though i have limited sizes available for buyers as i am useless with fauxtography .
positive	thank_you !
negative	seems they only want people to see good comments , not truthful ones !
positive	items arrive well_packed & quickly .
negative	at the moment i want to hit somebody , i am so frustrated and depressed .
negative	i did just that and they still charged me .
neutral	how wrong was i .;( the next business day i was contacted by taschen paradies and advised the product is out of stock .
negative	then almost a week_later another email asking for an extra £_00 ( 000_% of the original charge on top ) due to the box supposedly being 0cm longer , 0 cm taller and 0cm wider than stated .
negative	they dont stock many brands , or they are " out " of everything you need .
positive	having never_heard of the site before i was a tad anxious to purchase .
negative	i
negative	sorry to say that i will not be using serenata again as long as they use yodal for deliveries .
positive	one happy buyer and a very happy receiver .
positive	this is a company that takes customer_care seriously .
positive	couldn_'_t have asked for more .
positive	i did upgrade it to the next price £_00 . 00 , but from the sounds of it , it was so worth it .
positive	hop on the site , pop in the information and the bag arrived in a few_days .
positive	i have dealt_with natures_best for many_years and will_continue to do so as they provide an excellent service at a good price .
negative	obnoxious cabin_crew who we had the ' pleasure ' of putting up with drunk and loud next to the pool for most of what was left of our ' relaxing ' holiday .

neutral	this order was easy and straightforward to process .
neutral	i had two rolls and both rolls only weigh 00_kg each .
positive	i would not_hesitate to recommend muscle_food to all my friends .
negative	also emailed to say one of the items had been cancelled due to stock , 0_days after order , took my money for it rather_than saying out of stock .
neutral	well_done for redeeming yourself serenata .
negative	avoid .
neutral	i '_m afraid i '_ve never received the advertised cash_back rate .
neutral	i was really impressed with the speed of despatch and delivery of my order but not so much with the quality .
neutral	but it has occurred only because we have called him and have asked to examine the car .
neutral	customer_services were very helpful and excellent delivery .
negative	the company should not advertise something they cannot offer .
negative	delivery was attempted at 0pm that night !!!!
positive	all my ' go to ' ejuices are from lf .

neutral	i requested a day for delivery and they were delivered on the requested day , but not til_0pm !!!.
negative	buyer_beware
positive	i found a great site and they have an excellent selection of quality product that are easy to purchase .
neutral	i ordered the item on 00th_august by the 00 it still had not arrived and i had to make 0 phone_calls to find out where it was . spoke to a very nice lady_who said the item had been out of stock but i would get delivery the following_day . which i did . would like to have been informed of this before having to send unanswered e_mail and then 0 phone_calls . maybe just unlucky with this item and will use this site again . but a speedier delivery would be nice !
neutral	i asked if the package could be delivered to another address as the camera was a present for christmas and i didn_'_t want my boyfriend to intercept it , i was told for security_reasons as a new customer they could only deliver to the address of the credit_card ; bit_annoying but ok .
positive	i did initially wonder_how it was so cheap , as it was half the price that ups are offering on their own site !
positive	i have used onlinetrophies for several_years_now for my rugby_club season and tour awards , and for golf days .
negative	so its back to the drawing_board for me as i need the costume for friday !
negative	i have emailed customer_support twice_now but still not got a reply back .

positive	every item that i have bought has_been great in regards quality , taste and very kind on the stomach .
neutral	i get a lot of packages from dhl and it ’_s only gone_wrong once .
positive	i will use them again .
positive	thanks again to tyres on the drive for professional service

neutral	been meaning to get in touch as i was distraught at having to wait so long for my supplements due to the incompetence of your delivery service .
neutral	millys offers excellent prices but delivery is very slow .
positive	good prices .
positive	then this is the website for you .
neutral	i placed an order on the wednesday , and other than an_automated confirmation_email , received no further confirmation until i chased them on friday ( so much for next_day delivery and good communication !).

positive	plus the website will help you with your goals .
neutral	get another job
positive	i received an excellent service from the national_tyres depot at portsmouth , they managed to get me in at very short_notice and the advice they gave was both constructive and beneficial
positive	good price and fast delivery .
positive	highly_recommend .
negative	slander !
neutral	i get the impression that this unit at sometime was a reject and certainly not to the quality of the units shown in the online pictures .
neutral	the reply gave an excuse which had no bearing on the circumstances and included an itinerary which did not reflect what had been given , at a price of £ 0000 , ie almost £_000 more .
positive	mazuma make everything simple .
neutral	this was the first time that i have ordered online with ellis_brigham .
negative	so many things wrong - if using subtitles sometimes the subtitles start again mid programme so you ' re trying to read current subtitles and subtitles from before the break .
positive	i was advised to use it by a friend .
negative	i am still_waiting for my deposit , to be returned , in the meantime i have contacted my credit_card company , who will act for me and tried to contact cartrawler through their complaints website , which allows you to upload your written complaint , but not supporting_information , although it states the info , has_been successfully updated !
positive	the website was easy to use and everything to complete the outfit was there on the same page .
neutral	this is no good when you have 0 dogs to feed .
negative	i have tried to contact them and you hear nothing .
negative	i then go online to track it to make_sure it was coming today as i had booked day off work which was unpaid by the way so i could be in to sign for this parcel , it said it was still at the keighley depot .
neutral	paypal takes such a massive cut out of your transactions , it almost isn_'_t worth it .
neutral	0 item ( a present for my daughter ) was broken in 0 .
neutral	i thought they would be a usual ladies fit , but they weren_'_t .
negative	the service is completely unhelpful , rude and incompetent .
positive	the two ornamental grasses were fantastic .
positive	good value tyres for my caravan fitted efficiently by a professional and friendly guy at a convenient time and without my having to move my van !
neutral	we had great weather which made up for the down falls of the villa .
positive	ok , we do live in a road with all house names which can be tricky but the dpd driver find it without_any trouble .
positive	i had no_problems_whatsoever , i ordered one day , the order arrived the next_day , well_packed , and everything was correct as per my order .
negative	overall i would never ever recommend hen_heaven to anyone and have stopped 0 friends from booking with the company due to the poor service we received who have in turn told others not to use hen or stag heaven .
neutral	great flowers delivery to be improved .
negative	it '_s been here since_0000 .
neutral	with the terrible_weather over the last 0_days , i today found the cardboard package sodden & falling_apart .
negative	luckily we were able to get another room at the hotel so the weekend wasn_'_t ruined .
neutral	it wasn_'_t clear why there was a delay .
positive	on both_occasions it has_been efficient and professional .
neutral	i was sure that eurostar would not let_me board the train without a reserved seat .
positive	its easy money , just shop normally and they pay you !
positive	being_able to view the flowers was a brilliant touch .
neutral	i returned a bauerfiend knee_support a week_ago through the ' collect ' system physio_room require and i have not received a refund .
positive	the faq gave informative information also .
neutral	please fix this .
negative	mark stillman
negative	the order didn_'_t arrive when it should have they said that a delivery had been attempted but no delivery note was left !
negative	how am i suppose to be confident purchasing items from littlewoods when they show such little care for the fraud committed and the faith of their loyal_customers .
positive	would definitely recommend envirofone !
positive	just great service !
positive	i will definitely use this company again , and cannot_rate them highly_enough .
positive	exllcent website with amazing others on all the time was told by a friend to use it and will never look back and deliveryed a day later :) very happy
positive	saves valuable time having to phone multiple garages for tyre prices , the economy option provided by blackcircles . com seem very good quality & at a fraction of the price of the main manufacturers , you get the option to choose a garage local to you for fitting & even specify the day & morning or afternoon appointment , will_definitely use blackcircles . com again .
neutral	the page freezes the internet .
negative	after months of practically pulling my hair out trying to get the situation fixed and never having any real help , i finally canceled my service .
negative	when i arrived at the rental_car depot , there was over 00 companies .

neutral	i ordered 0 items .
neutral	i ordered some party invites for my 00th which came & i was absolutely_delighted with them , and even more so when i received a 00_%_discount on my order .
neutral	however i have decided to keep them for a light summer shoe .
negative	no company i do_business with would consider_using them .
neutral	item was delivered to next door_neighbour .
negative	it looked like it had been spilt and swept up , or just left for people to walk over .
neutral	well_packed , no_breakages .
neutral	no_complaints .
neutral	delivery time :
negative	i definitely will not use them again .
negative	look on their facebook_page and many have had trouble with hotels not having the reservation or them taking money twice from their account .
neutral	but - not correcetted
neutral	the car a fiat_punto grande had dents in every panel , the windows were filthy , the rear doors opened intermittently using the remote and the windows in the rear would not go up or down .
negative	i tried to call them 0 times and was put to an answer machine , i emailed them via their facebook_page twice and they ignored it , i then emailed their support directly and was ignored .
negative	in all the experience took 0 hours .
positive	very well_packaged , great price , fantastic service .
negative	thanks in advance
neutral	the £_00 voucher is not the way forward .
negative	i emailed again , same response .
neutral	three_days_later when i called again i was informed that the item was still not in stock .
neutral	i firmly_believe this was the fault of city_link ( who are total p00p ).
neutral	the delivery is not as fast as other stores online in my experience .
negative	so now after_contacting customer service i need to go print a form off and then send it back to them to get my items resent or refunded .
positive	not only is it cost_effective - ( also postage free ) - but i can order at my own convenience on the internet and be sure that the medication will be delivered in chilled packaging within a day or two of my order .
positive	these_guys really know there stuff , i was really impressed with there knowledge and quick replies to my emails , my equipment came less_than 00_hrs after order was placed , a very friendly delivery driver took my heavy boxes into the room of my choice , there set_up guide was brilliant and helped making set_up so easy , it really was a doddle , to say i '_m impressed is an_understatement , credit where it is due ,,, i would highly_recommend creative_audio to anyone .
negative	dreams offered my £_000 of vouchers in compensation .
neutral	but what a terrible website to upload_photos , awful long time taken to fill in details , takes_ages ( if it works at all ) to add photos .
negative	now dictated to , take delivery on monday 00th as we are in the area or cancel order and pay 00_% cancellation_fee .
positive	have no problem using you again very professional .
negative	what level of customer service could this be possibly described as ?
neutral	i eventually received another email suggesting the same alternative and i accepted , although it was not what i would have chosen to send to my son , but by then i was rather over the experience .
neutral	i had to argue and pay extra to get the first two products sent on , which they finally did .
positive	account managers have been there when we wanted them and a distant support when we didn_’_t want them
positive	all good !
negative	ordered on 0 / 0 / 00 and got goods on 00 / 0 / 00 !
positive	excellant service considering i only remebered her bithday at about 0pm the night before , so i was very glad of the speedy service , my sister called me the noxt mronign to say how amazing the flowers were and she told me she had never seen such amazing blue flowers , she wants a dress in the same colour

positive	what more can you expect with wonder woman at the helm .
neutral	disappointed to find it only lasts 0 hours per wind , and when running the tick is much too loud , too loud to have in a child '_s bedroom .
neutral	it came in a cardboard_sleeve and the drop through the letterbox means that one corner of the album has_been damaged ( crumpled slightly ) and there is some creasing on the front spine .

negative	after 0 days and no contact i cancelled the order .
positive	first_class service , good communication from_start to finish .
neutral	in addition some of the bottles had a flaw and leaked .
neutral	to their credit , however , there is absolutely no_quibble when you contact them about the error / s , and if these gliches can be ironed_out i would definetly buy from them again .
neutral	of the two seals i received one fitted great the shower_door but the one for the p - shaped screen was difficult and it creased on fitting so not very happy at all with that one !

positive	you will be more wealthy because of the reasonable_prices .
positive	kept_informed of delivery every_step of the way .
neutral	hopeless .
negative	if you want a headache and the opportunity to speak to a number of people who will give you the run around all day and no resolution to a issue they should take owenership to resolve , then uk sports_imports are the company to part your money with .
negative	0gb free data seemed like a good thing .
positive	lenstore '_s service is fantastic .

neutral	cameras are cheaper in pc_world and argos
positive	cars are good quality , reliable vehicles and the booking and return process is quick and easy .

neutral	course ' you ', ( as in ' this ' survey ) can forward my thoughts to them , and ' they ' will contact me . ?
neutral	the product has not lived_up to expectation yet and have not seen results either yet .
negative	they '_ve got customer service reps who blatantly lie in store saying o0 and tesco are no_longer in partnership .
positive	i think this was my 0rd or 0th phone selling to them and will use again .
positive	( i ) if you like a particular designer , it is very simple to scroll_down through their products in various colourways on one page ; and
negative	this is another review about the poor service at the pekham store
negative	0_days on you still_havent got it and they wont answer your emails , live_chat dont help you and you have lost your parcel to the theiving gits .
negative	how can it be any better .
positive	i '_ve_used this company a few_times and no_doubt will use them again in the future .
neutral	however i made the mistake of also trying a top secret hotel deal .
negative	i will avoid this company in the future .
neutral	we probably tried to fit too many on a page . you would need to have a lot of time and patience .

negative	i live very far from my mum , so i ordered flowers to be delivered on sunday .
positive	i wish i had done it sooner , the amount of money spent on contact_lenses and glasses over the years would have more than paid for the surgery .
negative	i took it to my local samsung approved repair_centre to be told that the phone isn_'_t covered by the two - year samsung warranty as i had thought because it was made for the hong_kong market and the samsung centre can only repair eu models under_warranty .
negative	i had to pay for my own parcel ( delivery to hifi_gear ) on top of that they took 00 days to " assess " the speakers state then they charged me a further 00_% of the total_cost that was about £_00 as a " restocking_fee ".
neutral	mediocre meal going out and just a sandwich on the return .
positive	we ordered a radiator .

positive	my sincere_thanks go to flashbay for their professionalism , friendliness and quality of service .
positive	it was good to see the packaging was a re - used box and full of shredded boxes ensuring good protection for my order .

neutral	arrived in a massive oversized box ( you would think a packing compnay would have the right sized box !)
neutral	won_'_t be using buyabattery again .
negative	later that evening i received another email from them to tell me that my payment had been declined , but this email had a totally different order number .
positive	it was so easy ordering on line , i rang the hotline number to arrange delivery and they we so helpful - the work surface was delivered as arranged - to top it all the work surface looks perfect
neutral	we were then encouraged to buy overpriced furniture wax and a longer guarantee at an additional_cost of £_00 , the sales_guy looked embarrassed when i called him on it and we actually got both for £ 0 .
negative	i was then given the option of driving 00 miles to the courier depot the next_day as long as the boiler had arrived but had lost all confidence by then so had to phone round and locate one from stock .
positive	i have used kenable a number of times
neutral	they are not a big deal however i would of expected them to be in pristine_condition
neutral	estimate of 0 - 0_weeks when i ordered in mid_december but i now have a delivery date of feb 00 .
neutral	the trophies were cool , very nice and great value for money .
negative	therefore they sometimes do whatever they want with your money .
negative	.& take up with consumer complaints ombudsman who will act for free on your behalf !!!!!!!!!
neutral	ordered 0 items from the company .

negative	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
neutral	i received it the day after but unfortunately to late for our party !
neutral	the truth was the tables were never in stock .
positive	!
negative	i feel this is a major_issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
negative	wish i had seen these reviews before ordering a high value item from argos .
negative	my mom was left no option but to buy one month '_s supply at an exorbitant price .
negative	however , the service provided at the centre left a lot to be desired .
neutral	they didn_'_t deliver on the date arranged and sent us a text to say they would deliver on the next_day .
neutral	overall fine , only problems were assignments getting lost and extreme delays in marking assignments not even close to the 00_hours they say ,, even waited a week for some .
negative	my order was cancelled and debit went through on my account .
positive	delivery was advised over a three day period and mattress arrived the day before them .
neutral	although the networks can be far from acceptable , i have had many wasted calls whereby repeat calls have been necessary to achieve a decent conversation .
negative	ordered a fridge_freezer and paid in full - website said 0 - 00 working_days for delivery and i '_m now on about 00 working_days !!
positive	i have just booked car_hire insurance , that saved me almost £_000 .
neutral	da_vi ringede til jeres kundetjeneste lød det som om at det havde de aldrig været ude for før .
neutral	one of the sunflowers had lost petals and one of the alomeira had died .
neutral	on a more positive_note , the offers are usually pretty good .
neutral	contract is up in june / july . have not decided if i stay or go .
neutral	now however it takes almost a week after email ;-(
positive	the purchase was easy to make and the price was excellent too .
negative	like i said , first and last time i '_ll go there .
positive	so i called the customer service team and spoke to an agent who gave_me unbiased_advice on the products so i was better able to make a decision .
negative	last_week i had an_email askin me to review wowchers service and the item .
positive	the prices are really good and the service is second to none .
neutral	sizing info could have product measurements .
negative	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
negative	the investigation failed to find anything out , so another tv was scheduled for delivery two_weeks after the initial delivery was meant to be made .
negative	when i booked the delivery last thursday online it was booked for collection on friday .
negative	which was of their making , were answered with ' we can '_t do that ' ' that '_s not possible ' etc .
positive	service is quick and easy , and even when i messed_up , customer_support got back to me fairly quickly to resolve my issue .
neutral	after_reading the reply i sent them an email ( around 00am ) with the shipping reference and my contact number , no contact has_been made as yet .
positive	to my absolute_amazement , one minute i was telling them about my phone , the next minute , the funds were in my account .
positive	very happy and would use again
positive	the deal i got i couldn_'_t better anywhere i tried , they were great to deal with , fast efficient and good value for money .
neutral	however , it was delivered on time and we were sent a photo of the bouquet and balloon and although it looked ok , from the photo i wouldn_'_t have said it was as nice as the picture on the website .
negative	they said no - it was too expensive .
positive	it only took a few_days to order and receive the necessary battery .
negative	got a text offering an ipad , accepted than tried to cancel due to personal_circumstances email went back and forth over the period of 0 - 0 months trying to get it cancelled while still being charged .
positive	quality paper and good value .
neutral	and then , as there was no one in , i had to tell him to leave them in the green house ?
positive	i would recommend herbies as the leading company for customer service and quality .
neutral	this year i have had 00 imac '_s scratching optical discs , three ipad '_s with faulty sound , two ipad 0 '_s with faults , 0 macbook chargers fail , 00 hdd failures and an ipod_touch with a flickery screen .

positive	very easy to order and the flowers arrived on time and as advertised on the website .
negative	i have had no contact back .

negative	i recently ordered the ' prince_charming ' arrangement for my mum , when i saw the arrangement online i thought it looked absolutely_stunning and was sure she would be pleased to receive it , however when the arrangement arrived it looked nothing like advertised online .
positive	i would recommend webtogs to anyone they provided a great , reliable , efficient service .
negative	the material around the waist went into a massive hole becasue it was that thin and rubbish it went into the bin , i wasted £_00 on absolute garbage !
neutral	i have repeated lost deliveries here in spain .
negative	ordered 0 tallboys from bedroom_furniture world on 00th_march still_waiting for them 0th_april 00 days_later even allowing for bank_holidays delivery is a joke .
positive	a friend showed me supplement_warehouse a few_months_ago and now it '_s the only place i buy my supplements .
positive	as a constructive side perhaps you could price in gb pounds , otherwise no problem
negative	however , i have still received no letter of apology or explanation .
neutral	ordered light for the fridge .
positive	decided third time lucky to order the randonee medium_sized mitts and they were perfect .
positive	strings_direct exceed expectation every time .
neutral	staff ok , but there needs to more frequent transfers between park and airport .
positive	i have used_etyres in the past and have just used them again even_though they weren_'_t the very cheapest , reliable and trustworthy is worth a few extra quid to me .
neutral	i paid £_00 delivery charges for about £_00 worth of goods so i was expecting a better delivery service .
positive	oh no !
negative	i have been told they will be delivering the sofa back to me as it is now mine .
negative	have had to go through paypal to sort this out .
neutral	they did go downhill for a long time , now on their way back up , but still expensive
negative	ok so i have to wait for the phone line and then find out that the broadband which you have to install yourself - that in itself is rubbish , with virgin they come along and are friendly and nice and install it all for you , anyway you cant watch the tv or use broadband until the phone line is installed .
negative	dear_sir or madam ,
positive	i always buy my toner from these_guys .
negative	i pointed_out that this option would leave me without a desk to work on until the replacement arrives .
positive	take money , deliver the goods when thy said they would .
neutral	we used to use farnell for all our purchases of electrical components .

negative	waiting for richard to phone when a 0000 coin comes in to swap the coins over .
negative	what you '_ll need to know

positive	got 0 free pillows with the mattress .
positive	i got my screen within a few_days of ordering and the quality is really good , i am very pleased with the overall product and will order more from ballicom in the future .
neutral	the customer contact center is better_than the instore service ant day .
neutral	i still have no idea what happened in the morning , but both amazon and fridgefreezerdirect dealt_with the matter well and arranged redeliveries with dpd quickly and without charge , which is better_than many other couriers in my experience .
neutral	but overall i was happy with them .
negative	the excuse trustpilot give is that they are an open platform that allows any user to report a review they believe is " false ".
positive	what a great experience it was selling my phone to mazuma . from_start to finish it was a very smooth_transaction with progress emails almost everyday .
negative	wait another 0_weeks
positive	would certainly recommend and use again .
neutral	i guess they maybe should have said that there is likely to be a delay in delivery though but am i splitting hairs ?
positive	thank_you again for making this transaction such an easy and pleasant one .
negative	had no record of my switch request and talked about some data systems down and others inaccessible from where he was .
positive	i would definetly sell any old_mobile_phones with envirofone , the service is great .
negative	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
negative	i asked to speak with the supervisor as was not happy regarding the period of time it has taken to sort this bearing in mind we have paid for the said goods .
positive	i have used simply_supplements , for a few_years done everything online , had no_problems_whatsoever .
negative	tenable quality control and even worse customer service .
neutral	alway fine but needs better picture quality
neutral	easy to find and purchase tyres .
positive	a very wide_range of products and no_quibbling when i sent a collar back that was too small , owing to me not ordering the right size . i would recommend this company to anyone .
negative	the web - site is fairly basic , you cannot review / track your order once it is placed .
positive	a brand i became addicted to whilst living in the states .
neutral	i then travelled 00 miles to nearest pro_cook shop for advice .
positive	can '_t fault my experience - the order was processed quickly and arrived in good time too .
positive	easy ordering system .
negative	so , i had 0 tyres_fitted to my 0x0 , the remaining 0 tyres were to be balanced - although the driver quite rudely disputed this at first until he re - read his work sheet and decided that i was right .
neutral	i didn_'_t feel comfortable sending £_000 worth of glasses without insurance , but that meant i had to pay £ 0 for this cover .
positive	she was very happy to receive the flowers and cheered_her up thank_you
positive	i definitely reccomend buying from cartridge_shop , they are far cheaper_than anywhere_else i could_find but the quality of the ink is great .
negative	i do not blame the driver for my experience .
neutral	whatever , i played it and liked it .
neutral	quality appears to be ok but time will tell .
negative	i would not use hawkins bazaar or any of their other_websites again and would not recommend to others .
neutral	on the flip side , i had to deal with the photoworld customer service and it was awful .
neutral	this must have affected a lot of other customers and could have been extremely dangerous for my dog and other customers animals .
neutral	but was let_down buy the flowers 0 / 00 sorry
negative	yodel eventually phoned me to say they would deliver 0 days_later .
negative	didn_'_t hear_anything back so i rang up .
negative	thursday the 00th of may i receive a call from argos saying my items were not in stock , and could not be delivered until sat .
positive	the correspondence has_been excellent all through , delivery very quick , the package was securely_boxed and brought in by the driver , balber even followed up with what i had to do prior to my wife using the machine .
neutral	the flowers took 00_hours to arrive at my friends house , and the box was battered having been in the van all day .
positive	and there are so many sizes and a different options to chose from as well .
negative	to the directors of laptops direct - you need to do an " undercover boss " episode .
positive	great service but thought i should let you know that the delivery was ' stuffed ' into our mail box ( at the end of our track ).
negative	easter was meant to be special for her this year , surrounded_by colour and spring indoors as this could well be her last one .
negative	?
positive	easy to use , with full descriptions of the products and also very reasonably_priced .
neutral	i listed my preferences thinking i would only receive wowchers for my choice .
positive	my stuff arrives , well_packaged , no excess .
negative	i sent a further email with my phone number which also went_unanswered .
negative	yes they wanted to charge me £_00 carriage for their faulty item , i reminded them about the long_distance_selling_regulations , the law , trading_standards and their reputation .
neutral	good website with great range , but if anyone had told me it could take 0_days for an item to be delivered when you '_ve paid over_£ 0 . 00 p_&_p for a very small parcel , i '_d have thought they were joking .
negative	i cancelled my direct_debit after allowing them 00 days ( not the 00 days , mind you ) to action it and they start a hooting and a hollering .
negative	said the man .
positive	the longest i '_ve waited for an item to arrive is 0 day '_s , an i think that was due to the real bad_weather we was having at the time .
negative	it seems that they put 000_% of their customer service effort into the initial ordering_process and they don_'_t really give a damn once you have paid .
positive	the carts were new to me , but at such an excellent price they had to be worth trying , so , ordered , acknowledged , and delivered within three_days . very impressed . but always have been with the products and service from safercigs . have them bookmarked and would recommend them to anyone .
neutral	on a postive note ; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as ' private ' ends up on facebook , and we are now communicating with each other 00_hours of a day .
neutral	packaging can arrive well boxed but on occasions like my last order in a big empty box left to rattle around .
negative	stressful .
negative	***** 00 / 00 - still have not been paid .
negative	what a complete_joke .
neutral	but it would be better if they could improve their system so that it informed you up - front if there was going to be any delay due to stock , etc .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for a better service .
positive	i couldn_'_t find the exact prescription to match mine .
neutral	i was a little disappointed i needed to provide my own envelope ( unlike when using envirofone ).
positive	everything was quite straightforward as all was explained in detail .
neutral	good job im not in a hurry .
neutral	they blamed it on lack of staff but they had our flight details , so knew we weren_'_t coming in on schedule .
positive	absolutly_brilliant producyt and i will_definatly be ordering regularly .
negative	0 .
negative	valve =£ 0 . 00 ( if i knew i wold have given them the spare i have in my back pocket )
neutral	can '_t fault the fitters though they were very helpful . probably a blip because this does seem to be a very competitively_priced tyre site .
positive	great , thank_you !
positive	the prompt delivery and refund of my money was extremely efficient .
neutral	i believe that their success may be their biggest failure .
positive	i don_'_t even have to worry_about that part of the transaction , because animed keep me informed of how much " credit " is left on the prescription .
neutral	the guitar ( after some_tlc ) is great but was very disappointed with how i received it .
negative	do not use talk_talk , they will waste your time and are clearly a rubbish company if they cannot connect after 0 months !
positive	i couldn_'_t be more happy with the service i '_ve received from guitarguitar .
positive	the service provided by this company is exemplary .
neutral	was told to print my receipt and show my bank card as proof .
neutral	still not sure if it has worked though .
neutral	saying that the missing bits were soon sent out , just the lack of any protective_packaging being the real concern
neutral	the £ 0 . 00 charge covers the courier cost for next working day delivery
neutral	the biggest con is the computer as the labels are all in chinese .
neutral	was quoted £_00 but ended paying £_00 . 00 as there was a £ 0 gateick access fee and a £ 0 . 00 booking_fee added on .
neutral	when i checked with ups they informed me not had to order .
negative	we called 0 mobile nos that were provided on the booking about 00_mins before we reached gatwick , but no reply on one of them .
positive	given this daft gamble i had another look on t ' interweb , and found replacementkeys . co . uk .
neutral	nothing outstanding , either good or bad really .
neutral	by the same token i am very pleased with the quality of the goods and the ones which fit are perfect .
negative	as i have had to chase this up myself the time limits i must assume have not been adhered .
positive	i can '_t fault the service .
negative	do not buy from this company as you will regret it .
positive	the usbs looked great .
neutral	a confirmation of delivery was received for the 00th .
negative	you receive the confirmation e_- mail_stating that their partner has accepted the order .
positive	i would highly_recommend them .
positive	fast efficent service , i was all paid up in less_than a week from registering online .
negative	trying to get a response from customer service was impossible without having to shame them into it on facebook .
negative	rating 0 as required to enter a star_rating .
positive	00h after_placing the order , the tracking on dpd listed my order as [ nc ] - non conveyable , so i contacted tyreleader and they told me to ignore that and the courier '_s had a weird sense of humour and they were right !
positive	the best thing of all is the message to say when delivery is to be expected it doesn_'_t require someone to be home all day waiting .
positive	would highly_recommend as means of getting repeat mediation for something you have previously been_diagnosed with by a professional .
positive	when your prescription changes every two years , as mine does , it seems silly to pay hundreds of pounds for them each time .
neutral	i have sent my comments to bbc few_times and have never received a reply , even an_automated " thank_you ".
neutral	it '_s a shame , because i '_m a bit_iffy about using their service now as their website doesn_'_t say if something is out of stock .
positive	i would always recommend cewe to anyone_needing to produce a smart and impressive showcase tool .
neutral	i also felt that they didnt take critisism too kindly , i . e ., when i was unhappy with the care taken with the packing .
negative	if protect_your bubble cannot get the ' becoming a customer ' part right , how can there be confidence that they will get the ' making a claim ' bit right ?
negative	during installation i noticed a large crack to the paintwork and plaster in the landing ceiling , and pointed it out to the fitter as this was not there prior to their arrival , he shrugged this off and did not seem bothered , i then referred this with photos to customer_services .
positive	the mats look great and have improved the interior of my car .
positive	had two phones , one a year_old and one 0 years old .

positive	whist there were issues they were in no way wanapart '_s fault , in fact they were completely beyond wanapart '_s control , yet they still went to great lengths to resolve them .
positive	the fitting service was excellent with the fitter darren demonstrating the use of the products when he had finished .
negative	in any event , we returned the item pursuant to the distance_selling regulations ( something ebuyer need to read !)
positive	plus free delivery what more could you ask for
positive	i can '_t vouch for taste because i got them unflavoured but they work great in the recipes i '_m using them for .
neutral	perhaps the owner could concentrate more on the cottage business rather_than worrying_about promoting their other interest s aka the local village pub , you '_ll find the pub is the first place the on site book recommends you to eat at and it also has vouchers to promote it .
neutral	pricing wise you can definately get your dvds and cds cheaper elswhere online but pretty good pricing during their sales .
negative	paid a deposit of £_00 for a new carrera tdf road_bike instore at slough for it to be delivered on 00 / 0 / 00 so thought it was a good deal rrp £_000 down to £_000 saving of £_000 .
positive	web_site easy to use , full monitoring of dispatch , and delivery progress , provided .
neutral	i was away when i ordered them so did not see them until the following_day ( when they still looked a bit withered ) but not the best impression for my gf to receive them like that .
neutral	the shop did look after me here keeping_me informed through email etc .
positive	very good company , would recommend to any one , and will use again .
positive	the choice was so good i had
negative	i ordered a christmas star for my tree paid express delivery as i needed it asap i chose it based on the colour in the photo .
negative	i am now going out to buy envelopes so i can give to my family this weekend . i am still no closer to getting the envelopes from this site and have requested a refund for the missing envelopes
negative	0 .
positive	they also let you know when the item will be delivered so you ' re not guessing .
positive	- live view a key feature - current using fujifilm s000fs 00 . 0mp bridge_camera .
positive	could not have been more straightforward .
positive	i am probably biased but i think mine is better !
positive	the roman_blinds arrived on time and my husband put them up with no_problems .
negative	ok , here is my experience :
positive	whole ordering to delivery went smooth
negative	delivery came when i was out . fortunately driver read my message and called me . arranged for him to leave my package at our village post_office .
neutral	on the minus side - i purchased the lou soft_leather look top handle shopper - product code : azz00000 .
neutral	however , i had my eyes_tested about 0 months_ago an re - ordered from glasses_direct .
negative	i will have to write a letter of complaint to them as it is the only way i can get through to them .
neutral	perhaps invest a little in the transparency of availability re stock .
positive	couldn ’_t be easier .
neutral	ordered 0 pairs of keys for 0 different customers on same day .
negative	rest of your money to follow tomorrow .
negative	the failure to respond to my emails asking what will happen to replace it is very disappointing .

neutral	i have bought lots of furniture from oak_furniture_land and i must_say the furniture is lovely .
negative	did not want to accept_responsibility or have returned for repair .
neutral	i had to telephone to check progress of my order , and i '_ve never had to do that before .
negative	won_'_t be using them again .
positive	excellent service , very happy
neutral	' thank_you for your email .
negative	they have no customer service techniques which is very disapointing .
negative	i will write on every forum / feedback / review site that i can
neutral	you are loosing out on so many customers .
neutral	see above please .
neutral	hi there ,
neutral	though the quoted price might be competitive , your fees are undisclosed until the very end of the registration when one has already invested substantial time to book a ticket .
negative	i rang the firm to request confirmation of cancellation by e_mail and asked how long it would take to refund ( t and c say take 00 days ) given the fact that the firm could not process our request and we had not taken delivery of any goods .
negative	not a lot of help for people that dont understand computers !
positive	a very good and prompt service .
positive	i didn_'_t spot anywhere that explained why the products were cheaper was due to them coming from the far_east , however i gathered as much because of the detailed_information on the available warranties .
negative	i am making time of the essence in our agreement , and if that fails then i will commence legal_action to recover my monies .
negative	it appears that if the merchant is good groupon is fine to buy from , but if you have a problem don_'_t expect groupon to help !
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	happily i actually prefer the navy and i have to say the quality of both the text stitching and the items ( fleece , sweatshirt , polo_shirts and hat ) are fantastic .
negative	i do not recommend business phones direct to anyone - beware !
neutral	means i may not always use the company as often as i would like
positive	very good service and price .

neutral	sofa arrived , and shortly_afterwards discovered a fault .
negative	i rented a car in innsbruck .
neutral	support technique assez médiocre comparé à ce qu ' on peut trouver rue montgallet ou auprès des constructeurs .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive it until monday .
negative	i now have gone to consumer direct , will take to court next if need be .
negative	not as_described in listing , cant attach to tank .
negative	no compensation offered , infact when i asked for at_least three_months free rental i was told that as it was my fault talk_talk were unable to offer compensation in this instance .
negative	so what is this guarantee worth ?
neutral	i might be demanding , but when i see " next_day delivery " when i order something on the friday , i don_'_t think the following wednesday is " next_day ".
neutral	i guess there is always a trade - off between simplicity of the user_interface and flexibility allowed , and i '_ll watch the development of ( and continue to use ) this site in the future .
positive	i can '_t be fairer or more honest than that
negative	took 0_weeks to send me a cheque for £ 0 less_than quoted when i entered my items on the website .
negative	i explain that the ups department already have the parcel and were told it contained a bike was and they had no problem .
negative	according to ' customer_services ' it '_s drivers discretion where they leave deliveries , regardless of where you have asked !
negative	the website was well to use and i know there is a statement saying if certain flowers aren_'_t available they would exchange them with some worth equal value but it '_s disgraceful to send an entirely different set of flowers .
positive	i ordered my coir matting one day and it was delivered free the next_day !
neutral	after the site is done you are on your_own with it .
negative	very dissapointing and stressful experience .
positive	item was as expected . service excerllant
positive	!
negative	so far it '_s been five days_later , and my money is wrongfully being held .
negative	we contacted the company in march and they advised us the container was in quarantine and that someone should have called us , they told us delivery would be by the 00th_march .
negative	each time we got it home no difference .
negative	had further orders to place such as tiles and accessories inorder to complete the room . will be going else where .
neutral	i called loco0 and it transpired that gmail was binning a lot of emails from loco0 . and my email address was stored with a spelling_mistake .
neutral	the order did arrive on that date
neutral	the gentleman dealing_with me seemed a little embarassed and annoyed .
negative	like many people on here they revised the initial offer to a much_lower amount once they '_d received the phone .
positive	the packets i '_ve had to date don_'_t have any of those nasty additive after tangs , not sure how they '_ve done it but you can also recognise clearly the ingredients , they aren_'_t made up of the usual sloppy mess you get in some packet products that i '_ve tried and wasted before .
negative	never buying from there again .
positive	can '_t fault them in any way .
negative	paid for it online and collected it from my local_store just up the road the very next_day , as they said it would .
positive	tons of top_class items of clothing at amazing value .
neutral	i got an email back the next_day to say once you send the order it cannot be cancelled .
neutral	i didn_'_t get the exact item i ordered .
neutral	many apologies from both driver and conductress and some excuse about excessive traffic ( which was not apparent during the tour ).
positive	paid exact_amount_quoted and quickly too , would use again
neutral	this seemed ok with jk giving me feedback by saturday that the order was completed etc .
negative	arghhhh
neutral	total price was around £_00 . 00 .
negative	do not use this company
neutral	i ws told this was not possible as they had no way of contacting the driver . no other help was forthcoming .
neutral	despite going through in fine detail my phone order with the assistant , the delivery was not as ordered .
negative	as a delivery company surely this policy does not make any sense , how do the drivers delivery to the customer ?
neutral	it is the small things that make such a big_difference and i was totally underwhelmed by the lack of personal service i felt i had .
positive	great comms .
neutral	this may be down to carrier used but i have gotten used to better service !
negative	my review is for curries in yeovil , i ordered a product and paid for it on dec 00nd , there was no mention of the product not being sent to the store in time for xmas , after 0 attempts to collect it the last time on jan 0st and was told it still wasnt in i phoned the helpline , total_waste of time , all he kept saying was that it was in store waiting to be collected which it clearly wasnt , they wouldnt give me the store number so i had to keep going 00 miles just to see if it had arrived , i will never be using the store again and would highly_recomend using ao . com they were brilliant .
positive	the guy was very helpful and didn_'_t talk to like the proverbial cave man which is always a bonus .
negative	if they offer more try to check price with amazon or e_bay on one occasion a book they offered £_000 for was worth £_000 .
positive	being a smaller , less known company i had my doubts and my worries when buying from this site .
positive	feedback from the company was fantastic when one of the products was out of stock .
positive	found a wash_basin and loo for £_00 . great value .
neutral	took too long to get to me .
negative	they didn_'_t know where the driver was and so didn_'_t know when the delivery would arrive .
positive	i '_m happy with my purchases
negative	i called to cancel in good time , sent back my card in good time , all of which was confirmed by email from the company .
positive	the items i ordered were well_packaged , and i will certainly be ordering from this company again .
positive	got 0 canvases made up , gave them to my sister who had no wall space , and the next_day they were on her wall .
negative	as soon as we changed we got another bill telling us we had cancelled our contract early and owed a total of over_£_000 to bt for usage and dissconnection . we still have the original working number and all the paperwork to prove against the bills we were being sent . its now been 0 0 / 0 years and our phone line and internet are great with our current_supplier ( not bt ) but bt are still trying to take us to court for money that they say is owed to them .
neutral	website is excellent and easy to order but once you have pressed that button to pay and ship you get very little information .
neutral	i '_d paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to have a tracked order and next_day delivery and was initially sent an_email to tell me once it was dispatched i would be told roughly when to expect it .
negative	never pay tesco credit_card using direct_debit facility .
negative	i very rarely hope that a company goes_bust , but the sooner it happens to vodafone the happier i will be !
positive	good prices and quick delivery !
neutral	it is always a bad policy not to have fully inclusive rates , it is very annoying to be asked to pay extra for ins etc after paying in advance it is not nessessary for you not to have inclusive rates , extra driver charge a bit expensive for the short rental_period ,
negative	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn_'_t be delivered when required .
negative	we '_ve reviewed your site and we still see links to your site that violate our quality guidelines .
positive	so i '_d happily buy again from mrmemory .
negative	we cancelled and went to bt and have a much_better service .
negative	what a joke - yankee_doodle need to practise what they preach .
negative	a waste of time .
neutral	having not heard_anything for a week after ordering an inhaler
neutral	no_hassle
neutral	hi , car ok car a bigger one than paid for so well pleased .
positive	i '_ve not used this company before and am a little_sceptical of shopping on the web .
positive	we have used_skypark_secure several_times now and they are always our go to for airport_parking .
negative	i then found that two payments of £_000 had been taken by groupon from my account .
negative	i accepted payment as i was already massively out of pocket and at this point i was willing to accept defeat and write off my entire experience with this dreadful company and even this took 0 days before funds where received in my account .
neutral	received an email that the parcel had been delivered , it had but not to me .
positive	have used mazuma_mobile before and the service was excellent then and the same now .
negative	a top_priority client needed goods for another event - he calls to say they havent arrived .
positive	package arrived in excellent shape , and wonderfully fast .
negative	after 0_weeks of them fobbing_me off with stories of how they would get me the missing parts , i gave up and asked them to take the tap back .
negative	another single pair ( most expensive i '_ve ever purchased ) bought at the same time were ok when bought , but a few washes later ( hand washed - never in very hot_water ) had lost all elasticity .
neutral	i '_ve been using them for over 00 years in one way or another , and keep returning to them as they do have a good range of products and their prices are good value .
positive	i ordered the set post on the saturday , a very simple process i have to say .
negative	financial pressure !
neutral	!
positive	good service and fast delivery .
neutral	!
negative	outdated food , undercooked instore biscuits , filthy shop floors dopey staff and a management_team that must have mickey_mouse degrees in window shopping ??
positive	good web_site , was easy to order , and deliveries were prompt , especially as i live in france
positive	i contacted easy welly and ordered my chosen boots .
negative	the porch has a door without a lock which hides it away from passers_by .
positive	i found go - electrical through and online search , and was delighted at their web - price .
positive	if you need advice , the customer service team are friendly , professional and efficient .
neutral	0nd journey , driver was rude , argumentative , sent him away had to wait for a replacement driver , better but middle lane hogger
positive	pick_up for free if over £_00 .
neutral	the company needs to get its act_together .
neutral	you '_ve missed the point of what i am talking_about - i believe they did meet your condition criteria , otherwise i wouldn_'_t have sent them .
neutral	i requested a ford_fiesta or similar which i know will seat 0 adults and luggage comfortably
positive	choose date and time for guy to appear at house to change tyres over .
negative	no monies were taken so i didn_'_t have to chase for a refund .
negative	signed_up with talk_talk over the internet for broadband and telephone on the 00 august and paid £_000 . 00 line rental up front by debit_card .
positive	i couldn_'_t buy this particular item from any of my local_shops .
positive	their price was very competitive , in fact , cheaper_than any other i found .
neutral	when we were getting on the bus at the airport - on entering the bus people were standing around with their luggage at their feet on the bus instead of putting it up on the racks then sitting down on the seats provided , thus_making it difficult for other people to get on the bus tripping_over cases , etc .
neutral	it '_s great you buy the phones but now the free_postage gone its £ 0 plus even before made any profit
positive	parts as identified , good price with excellent service
neutral	its great having the menu prepared and not having to think what to have .
positive	the whole_process was hassle_free , all the staff were very helpful and i would certainly recommend them to others .
neutral	they never have codes i want , when they do they ' re out of date
neutral	there wasn_'_t much information about the particular product i ordered and therefore it was unsuitable but the quality of the products were very good though .
positive	incredibly easy to sell the phone , all taken_care of in 00_hours , money in the bank on reciept of phone !
positive	coat is as expected , i had tried it on before so i knew it was quality .
neutral	the 0cm foam is actually 0cm max as the bed designed to look much deeper than it actually is , this was a dissappointment for me as i chose this bed because of its delux feel and that they claim it to be the their top bed .
neutral	i would recommend this boot to others and would purchase physio_room products again , however , i will be checking amazon first !
positive	i ordered the incorrect part and contacted them to see if they could supply the correct one - the only difference being the back plug fitting was the other way up .
negative	i have waited ages for this product
negative	please can you forward me info on what to do next re contacting serenata_flowers !
negative	( interestingly it was urgent , by the time i got to kent i had several missed calls from the fraud squad wanting to talk to me relating to possible card misuse , and they had put a stop on the card until i could confirm my identity etc_.)
positive	fantastic service and fantastic products !
positive	quick emails responses by the staff .
neutral	the site was easy to navigate through .
positive	the item was very well described on your website , along with a competitive price which made the sale for me .
positive	delivery didn_'_t take too long , in short delighted with product .
negative	i email there 00 hour service and still_waiting for them to call me back ( 00_hours ).
neutral	the transport had the wrong name and hotel .
negative	the delivery took over 0_weeks to arrive even_though the items were in stock .
negative	i went back on the website just to check and yes , i '_m right , on the site and preview it looks fine .
neutral	no reply until the tuesday , but they did reply , eventually .
neutral	chased on tuesday or wednesday ( can '_t remember which ) to be told exactly the same thing ( almost word for word ).
positive	love the fact they colour code their bag so you know which food is frozen , chilled or room_temperature and that they will carry it right to the kitchen for you , rather_than just leaving it at the front_door .
neutral	i am hoping this is a one off .
positive	and they look and feel very christmassy .
positive	the website is easy to use and the delivery was bang on time .
positive	i will recommend globalwebpay to everyone i know .
neutral	the sioftware isn_'_t as easy to use as other photobooks i '_ve done and it took a bit of time to navigate my way around the programme .
negative	i would recommend people to stay_away from this company unless u enjoy getting poor customer service and incorrect bills .
neutral	instead of enduring the call queue again , i emailed .
negative	you typically cannot get a re - delivery , unless you contact the shipper and ask them to authorize re - delivery .
neutral	also when they arrived they were all sticky !
neutral	good costume but on blowing up the face first time , it deflated . so now trying to find hole !!
negative	after_trawling_through their awful automated menus on the customer service line , i finally found the local_depot number on a forum website ( it '_s not listed on dpd website ) and managed to speak to a human_being .
positive	easy to fix to pram and stores well in upright_position when not in use .
negative	despite me regularly sending emails requesting that the correct_size be sent , including photographs to prove the skirt was too small , the customer service department just ignores any communication .
neutral	we were flying upper class as i am very disabled and unable to sit in an ordinary aircraft seat for longer_than 00_mins .
negative	he would not accept this and stated that i would either have to pay £_000 deposit , directly_into his bank_account , returnable 0 to 0 days after return , or take out their own insurance at £_000 .
positive	brilliant service order came the next_day , well_packaged , would definitely use again .
positive	we ordered some specialist_cat_food from viovet and they were quick and easy .
positive	if not look it up .
negative	will never use again !!!!
positive	i bought my item here and had it posted to my door faster_than my local plumbing supplier could get it for me .
neutral	wanted to pay cash on the day , no such option .
positive	i haven_'_t sent flowers in years prior to this occasion , however i am so impressed by the choices and quality of flowers and service may do so more often from serenata_flowers .
positive	hardest_thing in the whole_experience was making the choice as to which barstool to buy !
negative	what are they thinking might happen ?
positive	good company .
neutral	i rang this bell 0 times then , after nearly 00_minutes , phoned the office and eventually someone arrived .
positive	always easy to find what i require .
positive	it was really easy to order from the website .
positive	excellent service , good quality , quick and efficient .
negative	the simple matter of the fact is alpharooms , i did state we were travelling together , several_times .
negative	rescheduled for wednesday and ( awww , you ' re ahead of me aren_'_t you ?)
neutral	kind of a long gap through it all and with added confusion of the updates with your customer_services on it all .
negative	if i hadn_'_t contacted the retailer , like a lemon i would have waited indoors all day for a delivery which was never going to materialise .
neutral	my wife works until 0 : 00 and i would have appreciated some kind of update or assurance that it would arrive by a certain time ( it just says " on the day " - does that mean they might be delivered at midnight ?).
negative	my story , i ordered a new ( ex_display ) sony_tv for over £_0k back at the beginning of may for delivery on the friday .
positive	i was not sure if it would all work very well but the entire_process from requesting a quote to getting my money was seamless .
negative	i am still_waiting for the delivery and have had to sort interim pain_relief .
negative	it might be useful .
neutral	we got the feeling we paid more than half the plane put_together though .
negative	waste of time nuff_said
neutral	there was no apology no explanation and no refund . it took almost a week instead of 0 days .
negative	particularly as my original honest post was reported to trustpilot for allegedly contravening guidelines .
neutral	the bunch was smaller_than pictured but were pretty none the less .
neutral	desværre var_der intet som helt levede op_til forventningerne eller passede , skulle nok have set varen inden i butikken inden .
neutral	i have also not been sent a email or a text regarding this order
neutral	please can you review and advise when i can expect to receive the headphones ?
neutral	the online forum that they host is the only reason i carried on using them after the atrocious start to my ordering from them .
neutral	so i '_m afraid it '_s bye_bye viagogo
negative	you zoe bull ( littlebull - tarwbach ) zoevictoriabull @_btinternet . com seller '_s id : mckennzie00 notorious ebay thief !!
positive	order was quick and simple to do .
negative	average value
neutral	not quite as_described - ie pics showed glass but it wasnt delivered with it & therefore cost a lot more to get bespoke made up .
neutral	paid for express delivery yet it took 0_days to arrive .
negative	the only time i have had them seem eager to communicate is whrn they want to sell more product at which point they are very persistent .
negative	this time we ordered 0x 00cl x 00 lowenbru original lager total bottles 00
neutral	there was no returns_slip so i had to ring the call_centre to advise i wished to return the item and was informed returns were not free .
negative	delayed the order for several weeks due to one item being out of stock .
negative	spoke to a manager who said they could look into the issue but would take up to 00 days by which time i would be obliged to honour the contract .
negative	in sharp contrast to rentalcars .
neutral	however this was not the case but i was not overawed as the instructions seemed reasonably clear .
positive	great website , easy to use with idiot_proof instructions for the computer_illiterate .
negative	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
negative	it is much_better to book directly with the relevant car_park rather_than using this agent .
negative	well if i wanted a alternative item i would have ordered it to start with !!!
negative	i ordered a 000gb ipod_classic online .
neutral	claims on the website that clients often receive goods the following_day after ordering should be removed if they are only going to use second class_post .
neutral	i get the feeling that it would be a nightmare to resolve a problem with an exchange .
negative	bad service .
negative	?
positive	i would recommend them .
negative	take my advice , never buy anything from yongnuo and don_'_t even hope for good or even satisfactory customer service .
negative	can i please get a refund
negative	( yes 0 months , i know amazingly fast right !)
neutral	sometimes items booked or paid for especially on expedia have never shown on my activity .
negative	there was absolutely no desire to budge or help or " waste time " on a customer wanting to spend the money on their company and buying the product .
negative	what really annoyed me is the completely unprofessional manner in which they handled the entire_transaction , and it '_s what has prompted me to write something of this length , which i never normally do because i never have to .
negative	would never recommend
neutral	assorted stock and prices but when ordered normally efficient service
positive	it was like what it said in the details
neutral	i would not trust them again for ordering anything such as this , for such an expensive item costing more than a lot of their tumble driers and washers they should take more care and have more respect for the customers by giving it the best chance of getting to them undamaged and in good condition by using protective_packaging .
positive	i must apologise .
negative	the watchhut you are rubbish .
positive	i will definitely be using double0 again !
positive	quick and efficient , would use again
negative	the following_day .
neutral	the suitcase was delivered from germany to uk within 0 business days and it was trackable throught its journey .
positive	i have bought 0 times from tier0online and have received first_class service and product each time .
neutral	i felt that £ 0 . 00 was quite_expensive for delivery but the boxes were a very good price so i still went for it .
negative	the chair only cost £_00 in the first place !
negative	i found it for £_00 less at an on - line retailer that i ' d never used but thought that i ' d order it from dolphin because i ' d never had a problem with them and i trusted them .
neutral	consequently , we we out for short time walking our dog and missed the delivery ( 00 . 00 am ).
neutral	one of the two front usb isn_'_t working .
neutral	given that i '_d had the phone for over two years , i would put this down to general wear and tear , but because i '_d already paid £ 0 . 00 to post the thing to them , i wasn_'_t going to refuse their offer to have to pay to post it to someone_else !
negative	no , i want to cancel , thank_you .
negative	whats the point in having reviews if they are fake and made up .
positive	in receipt
positive	the second time round i was promptly contacted by them to inform_me they couldn_'_t complete the full order and provided alternate options , to which i replied .
neutral	part of the order was supplied and frost rang me to inform_me of the mistake .
negative	i called 0 times on the saturday and left messages as all there agents were busy , l then emailed twice from my own email address then through there website still no reply . got a call on the tuesday advised l wanted to cancel my order attitude was shocking !!!
neutral	our booking indicated arriving on the 00th of may to pick_up car at 00 . 00_hours .
positive	p_&_p was reasonable and it was much_cheaper_than going to the shops .
negative	lots of calls still not sorted .
neutral	onto the quality of the chicken , not bad , definitely more flavour than supermarket breasts but we find them a little tougher / stringier than we ' re used too , they seem to shrink about the same as supermarket breasts and seems to be just the same amount of water in the baking_tray after cooking ( cooked in oven with seasoning in glass tray & covered with foil )
positive	have never used there mobile fitting service before but found the whole_experience exceptional and on this occasion found no fault what so - ever .
neutral	had problems with the website did not get to order all the items as the website wasn_'_t working_properly .
neutral	the buying experience and delivery was excellent and generally the website is more informative than most , except it seems for the product i purchased ( 0 x 00lt fusion box & lid ( pack of 0 )).
positive	boards delivered as promised and although one was damaged , replacement was received in 0_days .
positive	two nice lads and they took my old machine away for £_00 .
positive	perfect !
neutral	i also found it very strange that there was no reply when the door was knocked as i knew she was in and she has two dogs that bark as soon as the door is knocked .
negative	as for response , aberdeenshire is not , and never has_been , in the highlands ( trust me i live in the highlands and know the difference )
positive	my first experience at 0_star autos .
neutral	we still have the tickets and would appreciate a refund .
positive	oh_yes almost forgot , price was far better_than everyone else sourced on web / high_street !
negative	when i asked why they had sent me an_email on nov 00th saying they had been dispatched , the girl hedged around it .
positive	never been on ferry before where only the driver can be in the car while loading , all other passengers have to go on as foot passengers , at both terminals , both being along walk from terminal to ship .
negative	kundenservice war prompt und sehr nett , hat sich entschuldigt , " waehrend der bestellung ist ein technischer fehler aufgetreten " und hat den blumenversand fuer den naechsten tag organisiert .
negative	think she would be shocked to know how much i paid
negative	" because we ' re a web based company ."
neutral	and dont just leave it and do nothing about it !!!
positive	the service is excellent and the pricing is also very reasonable .
neutral	delivery was terrible !
positive	will use again
neutral	in the end a wonderful sales agent , simon thomas from the wigan_branch provided a solution .
negative	and both_times they just turn_up drop the machine off and leave , quoting " we can '_t remove any existing appliances " despite me clearly paying for this service .
neutral	the staff were always pleasant and the problems did not lie with just one person it was more the process that appeared to have flaws !

negative	it started with a mail that said " thank_you for your recent order however we are only able to provide one card per order and therefore if you require multiple products to be sent to multiple recipients you would need to place one order per person ."

neutral	flowers where very fresh and should last some time .
negative	there is no delivery van .
neutral	the truth apparently advanced seen fit ti quote me on the thinking they could make it cheaper themselves by buying the machine that makes a composite_door well the machine flopped and no one decided its prudent to me any of this , and into the bargain because of there failure to make it it would now cost £_000 extra to outsource i was offered a cancellation but no movement on price very unfair after some thinking and now 00 weeks_later i decided yes ill pony up the extra , was promised the door within a week still nothing after me chasing them and another cancel threat the door arrived and was duly fitted , is this customer service , !!

negative	however , the phone was returned , because " it was not in working order " and the offer was withdrawn .
positive	does what is says on the tin
negative	they use another company to deliver .
negative	they didn_'_t .
positive	thanks .
neutral	in view of this unlikely i will make any further_purchases or recomend to friends .
neutral	the product i received was excellent value for money and exactly_what i hoped it would be ,,,, however , it was intended for a birthday_present , so i paid for next_day delivery , it was not delivered for a few_days . missing the birthday and still no refund on post and package .
negative	i ordered around noon on friday and asked for delivery by saturday_afternoon .
negative	upon_contacting the support_team ( who to be fair , were nice , but clueless ) assured me it was a bug , whom the development team were well aware of .
positive	the customer service team was great to .
negative	what '_s going on ?"
positive	all in all one of the best companies i have bought from .
neutral	very disappointed .
positive	they have a large range of supports to suit everybody , everything is also priced very fairly , actually , this is probably one of the cheapest websites you can buy this stuff from .
negative	i was very !

negative	leanne
positive	bought these batteries for my phone which is now working okay . very good price and very quick delivery
neutral	dealing_with the salesman himself was fine and he did hid best .
positive	faultless .
neutral	if however we had reached our destination then we could rate blue_chip on the condition of the property , whether the location was as stated , was it clean , was there sufficient linens etc and how the process of getting the key went .
neutral	i was disappointed though that the products were not unpacked and assembled and that the packaging was marked heavily in warnings that if the packaging was damaged this would invalidate the guarantee .
neutral	i get that they want to be sure the delivery can take place but its a pain .
neutral	as i said in my opening sentence the return_journey was terrible .
negative	it '_s not good enough to say ' we don_'_t have directions ' - quote from your sales_team .
positive	i have used them before and would not_hesitate using them again .
neutral	the people at trueshopping were super , and tried their best to help us when their delivery company failed to arrive in time , we waited in all day until 0 . 00_pm and had to go on holiday without the generator we had purchased , and it was eventually delivered a day late , the delivery company failed to telephone before arriving , it was lucky my neighbour was around when they eventually showed up .
neutral	ordered a new mattress on - line and arranged for it to be delivered twelve days_later when it was convenient for us .

positive	worked out £ 0 cheaper_than the next cheapest online_retailer .
neutral	thanks .
negative	have just called again to be told that they dispute it '_s flat_pack and that i need to supply photographic proof !!
negative	in the mean time we have read that apparently a wowcher refund isn_'_t a refund at all , it '_s a credit_note which has to be used in a short_period of time !
neutral	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .
negative	i '_ve seen the numerous tv_adverts , and advertisements in . net magazine , so naturally thought they would be a good safe solid choice .
positive	a box of samples was sent out two_days_later and the order was immediately put through .
neutral	i will probably need to buy something_else or glue the existing knob together .
negative	luckily there were builders working in the road that helped put it in the kitchen .
positive	highly_recommend this company
negative	had to recover my money through paypal .
positive	i had thought it would take three or four days as quoted , so was delighted at the speedy service .
positive	a bit of a problem as i mixed up my delivery day , but they delivered ok on the correct day , and even their delivery driver was in a pleasant mood . and friendly .
negative	0_days they said .
negative	please , please , please dont use them !!!
neutral	parking was difficult to find .
positive	very satisfied with both the products and the service received .
negative	after 00 days they told me it was in stock but were waiting for my confirmation to ship .
positive	excellent quality .
positive	they always last a long while as well .
positive	easily ordered flowers online , received swift confirmation and then text and email_alerts as to the delivery progress and finally confirmation of delivery .
positive	i really had no need to worry , regular_emails and texts updated me with the progress of the order and delivery .
negative	it did not happen .
positive	we were reccomended this site by fellow bnb owners as vanilla_pods are very expensive here !
positive	i have not yet started to use the products but if they are as good as the service i will be very satisfied .
positive	just looking now to book later in the year .
positive	extremely easy , fast and free .
positive	the guy ’_s at prendas are very helpful on the phone .
negative	months past and after a lot of minor problems that all required lengthy and very frustrating calls to customer service , i finally decided to switch to another_provider .
negative	0_days_later , i was called to say " that was an_error .
neutral	can buy all the grand_kids their holiday wear without paying next prices but still getting the same quality !
neutral	last_year i had 0 freezers delivered in succession the first two without_success and the second which_resulted_in a loss of vast_amounts of food overnight .
positive	i have used jokers_masquerade before and always been pleased with the result .
neutral	items that were shown as in stock were not , this resulted_in my order sitting in their system not being dispatched .
negative	response from customer_care team ( no name this time ) advising that they would check with dispatch team and get back to me .
negative	then when they sent out the missing order they used an unknown delivery company called ' hermes ' who failed to deliver the item !
positive	ordered late sunday_evening delivered monday am
positive	this site provides excellent and fast service at very reasonable prices
positive	the outfit came really quick and it makes my daughter look the part i eill defo buy more fron this online shop !
negative	!
negative	this is the rudest , most ridiculous service i '_ve ever had .
positive	the above invoice , this note is to thank_you for the speed of delivery .
positive	would recommend these if ever need fancy_dress outfit .
negative	now we have to hope and pray we get our paid for mail .
neutral	love the dresser we bought .
neutral	long_standing staff stood around making small talk wth clients they knew , while i was stood for about 0 minutes with an eton shirt in my hand wanting to try it on .
neutral	advice to fellow shoppers : this is a site where you can order online , but everything else afterwards needs to be done by phone .
neutral	to which he replied ' ok but any longer and we will be gone ' which i thought was a bit rude .
negative	you are selling tickets for flights , events etc_., you need to have customer_support at all times .
positive	!
negative	a complete_nightmare experience , i will chalk it down to a learning_curve and never again will i use this company or recommend anyone_else to it , nothing short of criminal .
positive	the shoes where ordered from a friends wish_list for his_birthday , they were too_big so had to be sent back to exchange for a smaller_size .
negative	i sent another email complaint at the poor service and i then got an_email to say that the item was actually out of stock and i will be getting a full_refund .
negative	this has left me with no choice but to conclude that the manchester bead_shop does not value their customers or want to keep them .
negative	i kept checking the website and noticed the date slipping out , until finally the date said it would not be dispatched until after xmas .
positive	i ordered my appliances on thursday and they were delivered on saturday .
negative	i placed an order for £_00 end of aug and never got it .
negative	perhaps i should have expected nothing more when my surgery was over three hours late with no explanation and little apology .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	in that queue , several had just arrived on a flight and were therefore at the wrong desk ( there is a separate desk inside the arrivals area , which outsiders cannot reach because of security ).
positive	i therefore did not expect my money until at_least monday .
negative	got this for a present , tried to set it before wrapping and discovered it didnt work .
negative	how this company makes money is a wonder .
negative	deal with them at your own_risk .
positive	would definatly use again and showed everybody when they arrived .
positive	!
neutral	i was very impressed that the website actually asked where you would like the flowers to be left if no one was in i just don_'_t understand_why the delivery driver would not follow the instructions when it is a very helpful thing .
negative	not only that , but the box '_s were in very bad condition with wood showing through .
positive	if you want quick , efficient , prompt attention . then order from watch shop .
positive	best deal and fast delivery .
neutral	viagogo and companies like them are allowed to buy large bulk amounts of tickets for venues which prevents normal fans getting tickets themselves .
positive	great service , price and product
negative	lenses were ordered on 00th_may , not received until 0th_june , this is not 0 - 0 working_days as_described and left me without lens for a week !
positive	!
neutral	i hope this is a good investment .
negative	0 minutes on hold . tcha nam .
positive	ordered on sunday - received on tuesday .
neutral	quick delivery and good communication_regarding when items would be delivered but after a phone & text_message to appologise because it now wouldn_'_t be delivered till the next_day (& we subsequently left the house ), the items were delivered on the original day of delivery ?
neutral	anyone living_alone may not even open the door at that time in the evening
negative	havent received my product , ordered on 0th_dec and its xmas_eve tomorrow !
neutral	then they promise to refund ( didn_'_t happen either ) and redelivery before 0pm , this didn_'_t happen again and you send sms and email again that the time will be 0 - 0pm !!
positive	booked seamlessly online , on the one occasion i phoned with my api details the girl couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
positive	took less_than a week to price my phone , send it off and receive payment .
neutral	i ordered a large basket of flowers , in pink and white flowers .
neutral	i would not say dont stay there but be aware it is basic , room above the pub so all noise can be heard unntil pub closes , also had to ask for bathroom to be cleaned which was done promptly , friendly people , stayed 0 nights and no other cleaning whatsoever was done .
neutral	notified of a wednesday delivery the previous night .
neutral	the package on the whole is great but i do feel deeply angry that i signed_up to the 00mb cable internet just before they decided to choke the life out of it when you use it for anything other than surfing ( what , you ordered 00mb internet and want to actually download something ?!!
negative	when i asked about it i was ignored .
positive	brilliant service , i recommend to all my friends !
positive	it was simple they let_me know what was happening all the time , when they received the phone etc .
positive	i '_m usually not the type to take the time out of my busy_schedule to do surveys or reviews - but i was so impressed with the service i thought i should acknowledge such fantastic service .
neutral	after few more emails , one if which i said i wouldn_'_t buy from them again if they didn_'_t replace the shampoo .
negative	very poor communication between interparcel and ups .
negative	( the phone is barely even worth that new now ).
neutral	packaging :
negative	my wife '_s seller status with amazon was downgraded as a result of hermes /_herpes shabby action .
negative	when advising virgin_media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services .
negative	big_mistake !
positive	i couldnt wait_till halloween to wear it .
positive	quick easy and very reliable
positive	i also found a £_00 credit i was promised , which i didn_'_t have to chase .
positive	had a couple of items delayed by a few weeks until i got the keys , which was done by their helpful callcentre staff .
negative	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
negative	i was told the jacket would need to be sent for repair ( even_though it appeared to be unrepairable ) and this would take about one week .
positive	website is excellent with good description '_s of products .
neutral	( first use )
neutral	i was happy with service etc but the flowers don_'_t look fully like the picture .
negative	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
positive	guys are polite , knowledgeable and honest .
negative	next evening reply from customer service that flowers had been delivered to security who had promised to see i got the flowers the next_day , as flowers delivered at 0 . 00pm .
negative	sizes changed order a 00 it '_s like an 00 order a 00 it '_s like a 0 .
positive	i '_ve got the high_street at my fingertips
neutral	my experience with iconic_watches has therefore been a negative one and i would have second and third and forth thoughts before i place another order with them in other words never again .
positive	worktop_express certainly ticked all the boxes and we couldn_'_t be_happier .
neutral	you can see pictures of the hostel beforehand , read_reviews , view maps and you even get guides to the city you ' re visiting .
negative	that would have saved a lot of disappointment and extra_expense !
negative	unfortunately , they are no_longer in business .
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier received
negative	it had broken by the end of january ( completely dead for no apparent_reason ).
negative	i was told there would be an investigation a couple of times .
neutral	i find interparcel easy to use
neutral	it was a little_bit of a hassle but once he found us , we did get there on time .
positive	prompt , professional and great quality .
positive	we were delighted with the medals we ordered for a netball tournament .
positive	this company is excellent from the initial web_site to ordering right up to delivery has to be one of the quickest companies to deal with .
neutral	however , the delivery was hampered by the postman trying to deliver and leaving a card at my next door neighbour '_s .
neutral	first time using them , don_'_t think i will use again !!
neutral	the store informed me thy never contact for collection .
negative	reading thru ' some of the lessor reviews for go - electrical .
negative	not a great mother '_s day experience and will not use again .
negative	finally , they have an inability to send you invoices and credit notes which they may one day live to regret if they are ever inspected by hmrc vat inspectors .
neutral	although they have been redesigned they still make it difficult to pull down my nespresso_machine arm .
negative	staff are polite , but once the order is in , they make almost no effort to get the items to you in a way that suits you .
negative	do not use them as they are dishonest , are not based in the uk as they claim and provide very poor customer service ."
neutral	this seriously ate into our short amsterdam break and we were not even offered a cup of coffee to compensate .
negative	they offered me an_alternative - instead of a direct , up to 0 hrs flight a full day connection with a change .
negative	please find enclosed double 0 . 0 tog duvet .
negative	free delivery is no good if you wait_until the 00th to despatch .
negative	if you contact the livechat the operator will give you with a $ 0 ( or £ 0 . 00 ) money off code when you spend over_$_00 .
positive	easy website to use and great same day service .
negative	it is now 00 . 00 on friday and i am still_waiting .
neutral	meant to be a 0 to 0 day delivery , still_waiting 0 days on .
neutral	but the two were successfully combined in our ' shopping_basket '.
positive	i believe other ticket sellers should take a look at how it is done properly as viagogo do !!
positive	definitely will use northeastguitars again - no_hesitation !
negative	i waited 0 - mins and then decided to go and find a mechanic .
neutral	eingaben übers tablett sind oft fehlerhaft .
negative	this was pathetic considering the major inconvenience i had suffered .
positive	placed the order the next_day and received it on the monday_morning as promised .
positive	martin .
neutral	however , the automated confirmation of our order stated that we would be contacted within 00_hours .
positive	i recently bought some chrome door_handles from e_- hardware which were excellent value .
positive	0 christmas_pressies sorted !
neutral	i was happy with the speed and the price of the order but the product range has changed each year and i am_afraid the poduct choice for my requirement had reduced and the product was less_than satisfactory
neutral	it '_s not a disaster and i '_ll probably still wear it , but i was put off returning it because paul '_s - hair - world mentions when you buy stuff from them that they charge you 00_% of the purchase price as an admin_fee to deal with refunds .
neutral	the pods don_'_t work as well as the proper nespresso ones , there is still some leaking past the pod even with the new design .
positive	i was dubious of buying glasses through glasses_direct as my eyes are quite bad and i need 0 . 0 + in one eye and 0 . 0 + in the other .
positive	thank_you , i have passed on details of your website to friends so they can also benefit from your well made , affordable products .
positive	i managed to get meet and greet on looking0parking cheaper_than the 0 mile_away long_term shuttle_bus parking .

neutral	wasnt easy paying the discount price .
positive	had payment in 0_days from going to website .
negative	die_blumen waren teilweise braun oder abgebrochen .
negative	after 0_days , it still hadn_'_t been processed .
negative	never again l wil ; l be cancelling all contracts and dealing_with a uk_based company where l can deal with people face to face . stores not much_better not interested .
negative	this charge - backs scam has_become particularly popular on high ticket items such as laptops and so on , and in the space of one week 0 separate sellers that are on my face book list fell for the same scam .
neutral	by sheer_luck i have managed to log_onto the delivery company website which in almost_impossible to access to find out that the mattress was being delivered that day !
positive	they had excellent customer service especially i requested it to be sent before a specified date .
neutral	this meant an extra journey into_town with all that entails ( traffic / lost personal time etc ).
positive	had found it slightly cheaper from another_supplier but they didn_'_t have good feedback .
positive	the first extinguisher we received had been damaged in transit but a replacement was immediately sent out and the damaged goods collected .
positive	i was spoiled for choice its truly a great we company
positive	can '_t fault them .
negative	the first issue was one of the orders for £_000 never arrived , they admitted it was charged to the credit_card but never made it to the orders department .
positive	good communications .
negative	they at first ignored my complaint and after several e_-_mails and me stating that if they didn_'_t reply i was informing trading_standards they sent a very short terse e_- mail informing_me as far as they were concerned there was nothing wrong with my order but if i e_- mailed them the details ( which i already had done then ) they would look into it , so i sent the details again which they didn_'_t reply to so i have now have reported them to trading_standards and i have written to iflorist as instructed by trading_standards stating my complaint and asking for a full_refund but i am still_waiting for a reply but i don_'_t hold out much hope as they seem to have little in the way of customer service skills and their communication with customers is very unsatisfactory and not consumer friendly at all .
neutral	ever the optimist .
positive	0 . 00pm yesterday and the item was delivered today at 00 - 00 . am today .
negative	fantastic as i needed the items straight_away so i paid for fast first_class delivery .
negative	i have now had to get the credit_card company involved to try and get my money back
negative	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
neutral	the extra couple of weeks delay in getting my bike back on the trails , caused_by having to source and order a new part again , has_been really frustrating .
negative	my old subwoofer returned cut open , advised by mr digva to evo - stick it !
neutral	the jacket was well made and the website appears to offer two shades of red ; red and dark red .
positive	even better is the prices - can '_t be_beaten .
neutral	a bit dissatisfied with the product on the other hand serenata sent some more flowers as a token of good will which was nice wasn_'_t going to use them again , but i might give them another chance or might stick to next flowers or prestige_flowers
neutral	we were charged an extra 00 euro for checking in on a monday that was a bank_holiday even_though we were the ones inconvenienced .
positive	easy_peasy .
neutral	blue_chip apartments are usually spotless so we were very surprised .
neutral	anyway eye - sale did exchange them which i appreciate they are legally not obliged to do .
positive	very competitive_prices .
positive	next_day delivery , had to return an item because of none fit , and received excellent customer service .
neutral	i saw a copy of the request from hotel_direct to the hotel so they were telling the truth .
neutral	it was then sent to the local post_office and was informed i couldn_'_t pick it up for 00_hours .
negative	really really bad service but in the end after insisting i was right , they refunded me .
neutral	i would have appreciated a courtesy_call to let_me know that the delivery would not happen on the day it was meant to rather_than me having to take time out to chase .
neutral	i also am still fighting to get a refund for an item i have not received , it was ordered 0_weeks_ago and i thought it would be the highlight of my boyfriends christmas , but sugarush love have been slow and difficult , not to mention unapologetic !
negative	they gave_me the wrong amount 0_months_ago when i paid off my bill in full .
negative	he then accepted this but refused to send me a refund and said he was happy to go to court .
neutral	the car itself was very good and i have no_complaints , neither do i of the staff who issued the car , once i had reached the front of the queue .
negative	wasn_'_t happy at all , ordered for one , something for the iphone 0 , a skin , and got sent a skin for the ipod classic . what i ordered was a motorbike pic . got sent a green cow . now couldn_'_t get more wrong if you tried .
negative	no , thank_you , just want to cancel the contract - sorry ma ' am , cancellation department closes at 0pm . its 0 . 00pm .
negative	sadly the balloons delivered were faulty and all burst though not even fully filled .
neutral	i would say , its the cheapest buy , and knowing what you buy works , but when i bought it i tried the ps0 and switched it on , but the controller kept blinking and didn_'_t work properly , as it had a faulty usb connection .
positive	i needed to dispose of my old appliances - they took them away before bringing in my new appliances .
positive	mike came to the rescue again and sorted_out technical problem !
positive	the products are delicious .
positive	recommended site and will definitely come_back .
negative	so i sent the phone to them and a few_days_later received an email_saying there was a fault with my phone and that it was not brand_new , they reduced the agreed price by just over 00 %!
positive	i chose to get payment by bank_transfer and it showed up two_days after they received my phone .
positive	you can '_t get better_than that .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery but the items took 0 days to arrive - problems with the delivery company unfortunatly .
neutral	perhaps the process for passing the delivery instructions to the courier need to be reviewed .
neutral	i decided to cancel .
negative	my wife and i are of average build , and we have an average car .
neutral	this is disgusting service , she paid her hard_earned_money only to have expired chocolates delivered .
negative	when item finally arrived it wasn_'_t suitable and they had the audacity to deduct 00_% from my refund .
negative	thanks my repair_centre for making me pay 00 pounds for nothing !
neutral	good value , prompt turn_around and will use them again but they are a long walk_away from perfect
negative	in all the years whereby i am buying supplements online , nothing of this has ever happened to me before !
negative	ordered a present 0_weeks before_xmas , pcw sent wrong item .
positive	what '_s not to love ?
neutral	however , the vase , which i paid_extra for , was too small for the arrangement and the arrangement had no card with it so my mother had no idea who sent the flowers .
positive	hit the web first and fairly quickly discovered some tyres that fitted what i was looking for .
positive	pretty_impressive you might think except this is to highland , scotland where half the companies charge a ridiculous surcharge for delivery or won_'_t deliver at all .
positive	thank_you !
neutral	det hade varit bra med_en bättre kvalitetskontroll som troligtvis hade upptäckt missfärgningen .
negative	i had written everything down that was wrong and told the ccl tech .
neutral	delivery is ok .
negative	where i appreciate that iflorist do a great job usually as ive used them many_times and always been happy with the flowers i do feel they need to visit the shops they have registered with them as some are not shops but con women posing as florist shops .

neutral	they were supposedly dispatched on 0nd_april by first_class_post .
positive	not only did you have the pads from an ancient but still very effective pair of headphones , you had a very useful adapter to turn 0 mm jack to 0 . 0 mm jack .

positive	shipping was prompt and delivery was earlier_than_expected .
positive	i had the unique difficulty that the model and make number of my shower were unhelpfully excluded from the exterior or in the building info .
neutral	unfortunately although i don_'_t think it was pet_supermarket fault it does tend to impact on their rating
negative	well it is isn_'_t it
neutral	unfortunately the recipients were away celebrating their golden_wedding and flowers were left under the hedge

negative	i put my complaint in writing , ( noting specifically that incorrect and misleading pre_- purchase information had been used at the point of sale ), made several phone_calls and sent numerous_emails but received no reply or an offer to exchange the tiles .
negative	i doubt i will use this company again , mistakes_happen but to be told two different stories does not give one confidence in the company .
negative	so i checked my booking through the alpharooms website and saw to my surprise that it had been cancelled .
neutral	shopping was easy to do - great pictures and user_friendly but i placed an order which stated delivery in 0 - 0_days .
neutral	good experience though .
negative	i have now been told that my order has_been sent on a 00 hour delivery period and that they scan it " no one home , left contact card " becuase obviously they like to upset their customers .
neutral	i have used different airport_parking companies and this is the first time this has happened
negative	dir .
neutral	good , it '_s money for nothing really , i would be buying stuff anyway , some retailers don_'_t honour their cash_back tesco being the worst twice i '_ve chased them for cash_back
positive	thanks , i `_ll be back
positive	have never had any_problems
positive	all in all i was very pleased , and fail to see why anyone would by a worktop from the big diy_stores at nearly twice the price .
negative	i cancelled the order and waited 0_days for my money to be returned - much slower_than when they took it !!
negative	i '_ve never complained about an online order before but this level of customer service was not acceptable and caused much stress and wasted a lot of time .
neutral	eventually despatched on the thursday without further notification ( by which time we were away for the weekend !)
neutral	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
neutral	so whilst product was good and sent quickly i wanted one matching brand of bulb only .
negative	i have never received any emails saying i would have to wait 0_months or that the delivery date had changed 0 times .
positive	communication about order status post sale was excellent and delivery was very quick .
positive	excellent web_site - good information and choice
negative	i bought this product from argos , read the do , s and do nots , followed the instructions to the letter .
negative	ebay and paypal , are the most greedy , unethical companies in existence .
positive	my first_port of call now for all kitchenware .
neutral	we were sold a sofa and talked into fabric care ( which they gave my friend free !!!!)
positive	i really enjoyed making the titanic 0d puzzle - i had never done a puzzle like it .
positive	instead of going to my usual one - i decided to try something_else . lots more choice for the sympathy_flowers .
negative	- the confirmation_email stated that we needed to have given the flight arrival time , not our arrival time back at the car_park .
positive	love the name !
negative	as she is such a technophobe it sat in the box for three_months .
negative	feel_cheated
neutral	also can '_t use online contact form until order number is registered on your system which takes_forever - no good if you have an_immediate question
positive	solved by adding stones to bowl .
neutral	fortunately , a friend who i mentioned this to , came around and set the router up wirelessly without recourse to the cd .
neutral	thankyou penelope tevose - clowe .
positive	just to mention that i wasn_'_t in when they first tried to deliver it , so they just called again ( i thought i was going to have to pick it up from the parcel depot ) - brilliant service .
negative	never again !
positive	placed my prescription order monday and received it by thursday_morning .
negative	re - booked for 00 / 00 /_0000 , 0 - 0 , received text at 00am on the day saying the order had been cancelled .
positive	without wishing to get too colourful , suffice it to say that my girlfriend and i are very happy with the various items , toys and sex aids we '_ve bought from this site .
neutral	i then spoke to another customer service agent at parcelforce who said i had gone to collect the item from the post_office too early and that deliveries are made at the end of the day .
positive	jokers was quick and easy to use right from the website to going to collect my costume .
negative	i am very cross about the service .
neutral	these flowers were intended to cheer_her up on the day of her only sister '_s
negative	i then emailed them again several_times and yet again got no reply and had to ring them again .
negative	i have sent another email and heard_nothing .
negative	i intend to take this to trading_standards as i fail to see why i should be liable to any charges for requesting a refund for a service that you failed to provide .
neutral	the first one i discarded as i thought that it was just a one - off .
positive	sent them my old_phones and recieved a cheque for the full_amount_quoted about 0 - 0 days_later .
negative	!
neutral	order not yet recieved
negative	this is not good enough i '_ve paid for a service its there job to provide it !
positive	really lovely flowers , thank_you .
positive	easy booking , excellent service , only minus was poor beef sandwich bought on fishbourne keyside
neutral	0st driver turned_up on time , journey was acceptable , a bit white knuckle
neutral	the goods came very quickly & i was kept_informed all the way as to dilivery times , etc so i would order from them again .
neutral	i called lesters before i ordered my item to make_sure it was in stock and how long it would take to get to me .
negative	i will never use this company again , i am not sure why they think anyone would still be at work at 0pm on a friday .
negative	long_story_short , i got a new phone and unfortunately had problems with that too .
positive	received by first_class_post in three_days , including the weekend !
neutral	courier / delivery guy couldn_'_t find our property even_though we are a business !!!!
neutral	while kandco is handy when you don_'_t have the cash there and then , things are more_expensive than going and buying on the high_street ,
positive	i had put off buying an annuity because it seemed to be so complicated , but krs took over all the complicated calls and letter writing , helped with the form_filling , found the best deals , and made the whole_process really easy .
neutral	i am considering just sending the glasses back out of principle , although i '_m reluctant as i wonder_if the " 00 month return_policy " has similar unwritten restrictions on it !
neutral	!
negative	i '_m disappointed to say i would not recommend this company to anyone and i '_m reluctant to ever use it again .
positive	especially impressed with speed and the overall delivery service .
negative	i '_ve circulated this story extensively which i hope will damage any further trade you could_possibly have .
negative	too bad !
negative	after 0 attempts to get someone to talk to me about the thermonet and what i needed to order ended_up talking to thermonet direct and i must_say they were professional , efficient and knowledgeable about the product .
neutral	great delivery service , great price although this year the balloon was not delivered .
positive	weybridge_audio were definitely good value and shipping was fast informing_me when they were dispatched .
positive	i will_definitely use them again whenever they stock what i '_m looking for .
positive	there was a special_offer on the website for a city break : lgw to lisbon , lisbon to miami and return new_york to lgw via lisbon .
neutral	i heard_nothing back from cycle_store at all .
neutral	would like to see a better service where you are advised without asking that your order has_been delayed_due to stock .
negative	i ordered online a number of shirts spent_nearly_£_000 however it says online buy one get one free , customer serivces not so unless you add two items to basket , absolutely_ridiculous when clearly the web updates to 0 items for each item , then you receive only one . they then offered me a measley 00_%_off next purchase but i lose 00_% of my order as no free items , very rude customer_services on online_chat and never answer phones . avoid this company be warned shop elsewhere online read all below negative_reviews . digraceful .
positive	happy also that i am not inundated with emails from you .
neutral	i think you should review this policy you have .
positive	i was looking for 0 good sized ( 0 - 0 feet ) cotoneaster cornubia trees .

neutral	until this i was very pleased with the service .
positive	supplement_warehouse is my number one supplement_provider .
positive	the " sensor dry " is probably saving us a fortune .
neutral	we have always experienced next_day delivery with screwfix on all products we have oredered .
positive	i travelled the 00 miles to mk simply to save_money and not be over charged for an mot . which pricing does seem like a lottery after ringing around .
positive	three things i value the most when online shopping !
negative	i have now been back to this company ( again via_email so that i have everything in writing ) and have attached all their emails and my proof of payment from them back to them and am waiting to see where they will try to fob me off next as they are telling_me i spoke to one of their colleagues yesterday and everything was fine ( i have never spoken to anyone ) but that later in the day they informed the payment had failed .
negative	and i should also make it clear that i will no_longer use your firm , and i will make_sure no - one else that i know uses your firm .
neutral	update - i finally got a refund from them with the delivery costs refunded as well but it took quiet a few phone_calls .
neutral	they didn_'_t respond to any of my emails , and it took several_attempts to get to speak to someone_who would do anything .
positive	this site is amazing , great bands for men , women and boys superb prices and sizes always in stock .
positive	dont spend a penny without going through top_cash_back 0st
positive	and don_'_t know of another comprehensive stockist such as jeanography .

positive	now that is what i call service .
positive	quick delivery .
neutral	site easy to use , although one of my spare mobiles - the newer one - an alcatel ot 000 - was not recognised by the system , so i '_ll have to find another purchaser or keep it as a spare .

positive	i have been a user for over a year now and this is the best cask back site i know .
neutral	last time , it took 0_weeks .
neutral	had to ring 0 times to get my warranty documents ,
neutral	i found this a little strange as there is no access to the back of the house from outside .
negative	when they finally do read it you will get a bunch of patronising garbage about how great they are and not much else .
negative	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn_'_t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).

negative	furthermore if i have not received a satisfactory_conclusion to this matter by tuesday 0rd september_0000 then i will pass the matter to my legal team and ask them to vigorously pursue action_against you to recover my money , compensation , and all costs .
negative	their sister company optimax then ' took on ' the warranty - but all of the ' treatment ' i had from them was displacement activity .
negative	the following_morning on contacting interparcel . com i was told that the tnt driver had reported that our road was closed with no access to the property .

negative	they were unable to ship one to thier show_room so i could collect it

neutral	that to me is not acceptable in today '_s online world .
positive	i loved that i received emails

negative	when it was received it was only 0mm_thick .
neutral	they then told me the screen will need to be replaced and it might be up to £_000 .
neutral	calling customer_services and getting through to the right department and talking to someone_who_knows what they are doing is a complete_nightmare , wouldnt mind so much if the call was a free phone number .
neutral	i hope you can clear this up for me .
neutral	this stuff really should be sorted_out electronically .
neutral	received my order without one of my items .
neutral	this went_smoothly until having re - accessed my home , i contacted timber composite doors for a refund .
neutral	the return crossing was pleasant too except the extractor_fan in the toilet / shower room failed to work .
neutral	they have an excellent website but i experienced real difficulties trying to contact the customer_services team to obtain a clear_indication of when the car was going to be delivered .
negative	thank_you for your message , we apologize as the first intent of refund did
neutral	food was expensive and not discounted as advertised , i was really embarrassed that people had paid for this !!!
positive	bought as a present for my husband .
negative	she got carnations - truly horrible - the day before mothers_day .
negative	rude , ignorant staff .
negative	i said no thanks .
negative	i honestly think that a £ 0 bunch of flowers from the supermarket would have been much_better_than the £_00 bunch i was sent by prestige_flowers .
neutral	the customer service you try to phone and report that you would like a visit , because there is a problem on my new siute i '_m still_waiting a reply as to when they are coming
neutral	now have to waste a days holiday from work to accept delivery next week , providing of course they notify_me when they intend to deliver .

positive	would buy again
negative	groupon say that the item was despatched to royal_mail for delivery but have no proof of this .
neutral	initally , tier_0 wanted me to send them a copy of my bank_statement as proof of my identity .
negative	i argued that it wasn_'_t the mattress i originally ordered , that the lady didn_'_t mention the charge and that i had been mislead by her ( i was told it was similar ) but it did not matter .
negative	disappointed son and daughter !!
neutral	other issues are the html - only emails you send ( such as the one inviting me to fill out this survey ).
negative	very poor battery life , keypad so small you keep hitting the wrong letters on the samsung_galaxy mini , i can '_t even connect to my email address .
negative	we stated we would withhold the cost of one window until rectified ( legal right ).
negative	we actually rang the sales_team after all of this and came_across very dumb , asking very basic questions , giving the impression we could just about navigate our way round a keyboard , yet where still told that brightpearl was suitable for self implementation !
negative	i '_ve had e . mails from wowcher but that did not work and it has cost more money in phone_calls than the voucher is worth .
neutral	they don_'_t answer emails

neutral	i got a bit_confused with the questions they asked about the binding settings and am still not sure_whether they have been set_up for me or not but i guess it '_s best to take them to an expert to check out anyway !
neutral	only to see that when confirmation came through it had changed our return to a day earlier , making very difficult for us .
positive	would definitely use again .
positive	they explained that the lights would be in stock in 0_weeks and they would keep me informed when they were despatched .
neutral	useful but it would be good to know to which removing companies get my details
neutral	what i do not appreciate , however , is the fact that price differs depending_on which country you are buying from even if you choose to buy in gbp .
negative	guess_what ?
positive	i '_m very happy with my purchase of a sigma nikon 00 - 00 lens .
neutral	that '_s great , but what_happens if one lives in an area where there is no mobile reception , and any message wouldn_'_t be picked_up for , probably , three_months , by which time it would be too late .
negative	i have tried to pursue this and find out what the problem is but they just ignore my emails . no idea why the online store doesn_'_t want my business but i think it '_s a poor way to treat a good customer .
positive	this problem was reported one evening to np_autoparts limited and by late morning the next_day a refund for the defective wiper_blade was offered and accepted .
negative	got email_saying frames sold out .
neutral	?
negative	called their customer_services line and have been asked to call back next week .

negative	amazon use yodel for there deliveries which in my opinion is a big mistake !
neutral	delivery a bit_slow this time
neutral	as a store you do not cater very well for women .
negative	the assistant told me once again there was no one there to make a decision so i would have to wait_until the following_day to find out where to go from here .
neutral	unfortunately the capsules don_'_t always pierce properly as they aren_'_t the same size as the nespresso_capsules .
negative	today is 00 - jan - 0000 and i didn_'_t hear from them .
neutral	i believe these should be clear before you get to the payment page .
positive	i was able to order and pay for my goods very easily and they were delivered with in a reasonable timeframe .
neutral	what irritated was the £ 0 +_p_&_p charge with no options for a cheaper or slower , delivery - for an aerosol that weighs next to nothing although it is relatively bulky .
positive	always look at going two sizes up for fit and length but saying that clothing is alwaya good quality .
positive	very impressed with the quality service - easy order process , update on dispatch and confirmation on delivery .
negative	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could_find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	disgusted by the product .
negative	i asked her , " you have all my details and tracking_number , why do you need to know what is in the package ?"
neutral	this makes safepay so much less intuitive to use that i '_ve stopped using safepay .
negative	hope to be getting a refund !
negative	i eventually had all of my money refunded by paypal today , a month after my order .
negative	disappointed as these are for a friend who has just lost her dad very suddenley we have sent the flowers from all her work_colleagues .
positive	also good follow_up to check all was well .
negative	i ordered a brand_new flash yn - 000 from ebay , it was sealed and under_warranty .
negative	there are many similar companies out there and i would hope that at_least one would have a better customer service department .
neutral	they either drop through , or they don_'_t stay in place well enough to be pierced when i press the lever_down , meaning pure water comes through into the cup .
negative	royal_mail blamed by both juno staff .
positive	the service excellent both with delivery and
neutral	set_up fairly easy but wanted to pay by debit_card which was refused as was the first credit_card i tried to pay with the second credit_card was accepted .
positive	delivery drivers where nice and friendly .
neutral	i spent over £_000 in two_separate transactions , on both_occasions delivery was later than_expected .
neutral	ive used this company twice and have really enjyed it .
positive	very good product range too .
neutral	when we finalised our booking we found out that meals are " not required " though the price was advertised as including meals ???

neutral	i also wanted to arrange an mot , as i then qualified for this at half - price .
neutral	let '_s hope the driver can find my house now !
positive	i had my veneers done at perfect smile studio hertford and i am very happy with the result .

neutral	finance was not granted by the supplier so the transaction was never completed .
neutral	even taking into account christmas and new year i should have received my order by now , but unfortunately i '_m still_waiting .
positive	service was great .
neutral	when the parcel did arrive it was missing 0 out the 0 items i ordered !
positive	not the first order i have placed with end and certainly won_'_t be the last !
negative	other_retailers have not ever done this and surely buying a phone off cpw must be a negative / counter - productive task .
negative	i phoned the number and found myself going to the voice_mail for a gas and property_maintenance company - so are yodel now using gas engineers to deliver parcels ?
positive	would definitely recommend and will use again ourselves .
positive	i didn_'_t realise it would be so easy to dispose of my blackberry when i upgraded to an iphone .
neutral	when i rang they had no record of it coming_back so i was rather glad to have proof of delivery .

negative	would not reccomend to anyone shopping with them .
negative	the title_says it all i recently sent my wife a bunch of flowers for £_00 . 00 and when they arrived although she was grateful the specimens were appaulling . dried up wilted and drooping , a poor effort by some teenage back room girl by the look of it . no i don_'_t recommend them .

neutral	basically if i hadn_'_t called my nan to go check out side , they would have been gone by morning .
positive	emails received to know when delivery on its way .
neutral	prices were good , details for payment appeared simple ,
positive	i would recommend edge_& wax for value and a professional service .
positive	tyre_shopper is a great way to buy tyres on line , i have found them to be great value and there web_site is easy to use .
neutral	very happy with the product itself id wanted to buy a more professional pomade and this seemed to fit the bill .
positive	we were even able to attend a family party the other evening for a couple of hours !!
positive	i can '_t fault the service that i have received from digital - rev .
negative	my wife doesn_'_t believe that , besides she wants to top up her phone which is why she got the card .
negative	apparently , it is next working day which off course they forget to advertise !
positive	thank_you

neutral	the flowers were lovely but were delivered and left_outside the property .
neutral	somehow , and i have no idea how , the order itself just disappeared from the system , called hmv and they claimed they never got it , yet the money easily went from her account . naturally one very p * ssed off sister .
neutral	i ' d consider it but it '_s not an automatic ' yes '.
negative	do not even think about buying anything from this company . you have been_warned .
negative	when i called for return instructions was told correct replacement would cost an additional £_00 . 00 , and also essentially told i was an_idiot .
negative	dpd couldn_'_t even be_bothered to inform_me of their error .
neutral	i have found better discounts on other_sites .
positive	item was exactly as we were expecting
positive	one item was missing a handle but i rang oakfurnitureland within_00hrs of receiving the goods and they posted one out first_class to me the same day .
neutral	every time i called , i was greeted with a negative attitude and zero willingness to help .
positive	the delivery service is quick simply out of this world and the quality of the dress is perfect .
positive	great prices and have alot of hard to find products !
positive	cheers
positive	really pleased , watch was a good price & was delivered next_day .
neutral	easy site to navigate and order but last delivery not as speedy as previous_orders .
positive	i was and in fact am highly delighted with the ease of use and service i received , and the flowers were fantastic too i will_definitely use this service again .

neutral	the service from the company was excellent and the delivery was swift .
negative	i received a faulty pair of skates , my kid fallen down within few_minutes because of the faulty and broken part .
neutral	this is an unacceptable amount to take as a deposit for a two day rental !
positive	products always arrive quickly and never been let_down .
negative	my husband and i have been appalled by the service we have received from usb_flash_drive .
negative	having been an existing customer of this company i decided to use them for a vet prescription purchase ( to avoid the 000_% mark up at the vets as its long_term medication ) i understand they cannot dispense meds without the hard_copy prescription so posted 0st_class on sunday expecting at the very latest tuesday receipt ?
neutral	i have used animed on several_occasions now and have always found them very helpful when i have phoned them - however on this occasion when speaking to someone to confirm that they had received my prescription by fax ( this been a thursday 00th_dec ) i was told yes they had but the vet hadnt looked at it yet and it would probably be monday the 00th before the vet looked at it and i would be lucky to get the order before xmas !
neutral	everytime i seem to book with wowcher , there '_s a problem .
positive	good buy , service was fast and efficient .
positive	with speed and the staff can '_t be_faulted , yes i will be going back for

positive	very pleased with the service provided , excellent advice given and my wetsuit arrived the following_day .
positive	website easy to use , delivered promptly and return actioned quickly
neutral	i didnt get an_email to say they had recieved the phone , or to say it had passed_testing , when i logged_into my envirofone account i did see all of this but i think as a busy person you should email these things just as peace of mind really !
positive	highly_recommended and i '_ll be using them again .
positive	excellent prices great service , fast delivery and top returns_policy .
negative	however , the import_tax was over double than what i was required to pay .
neutral	this needs to be pointed_out to purchasers .
negative	my father told_him he was happy with that .
neutral	this is a present for a family_member and its looks as if i have printed the labels off the internet and put them on myself !
negative	i want my money back .
negative	i did not recieve my £_00 pound wellies as the courier left them with a " neighbour " who just happened to live 00 doors away from me . no card was put through my door to say parcel had been left at the house 00 doors away . and that is no exaggeration . when called customer service they told me there was nothing they would do as had been left with neighbour . although i did not permit them to do so .
negative	if i could give them - 0_star i would have done that .
negative	no luck .
negative	it said i could collect from 00pm on the monday .
positive	quality products , great designs and brands .
neutral	we eventually got to make our booking , but due to the delays with blue_chip holidays coming_back to us , it was not the week we we ' re originally looking to book , and it additionally cost us more .
negative	it would be too rude to state what we really think of them .
neutral	i emailed gadget_panda back but was told that at_least two people check each phone received and they were adamant that one of the water indicators was red .
positive	i have always bought really good beds i believe its very important to not scrimp on something so important .
positive	it '_s so straightforward to get your voucher and really fast too .
negative	emailed everyday the next week & am being totally_ignored now !
neutral	time_slot for fitting of tyres was between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm .
positive	could not do enough to help us and make_sure we were happy .
positive	excellent communications explaining issues clearly .
positive	great service speedy despatch of goods .
positive	definitely hire off this company !!!
positive	all arrived in good order , much_cheaper_than other online stores just what i wanted .
neutral	got note in with my received item to say second item would come 0 week_later - item still not received and i have not received an e_- mail advising it has_been despatched !!
negative	i must assume that lee , tim , peter and justin are either pseudonyms or work for abbey_garden - or both !
neutral	the seller , however , dispatched the item immediately , and it was received in a reasonable time .
positive	the tyres always arrive next_day after ordering and the price is very competitive .
positive	the reason_why i buy from urbanara is the different designs are again excellent standard , costumer service is outstanding and an exciting web side .
neutral	the office staff at villa_plus in england and in majorca was very pleasant and helpful .
neutral	however , i received my invitations the other day and was a little disappointed at the quality of them but will just have to use them !
neutral	not once did the company contact me and it was always me chasing the order .
positive	authentic costumes that everyone admired , at a reasonable_price , if i go to another fancy_dress i would definitely use this company again for good value , they do a great range in accessories too , which set off the outfit and made them more believable .
positive	customer service is also money , they have fixed every issue i '_ve had and always respond within hours of my emails .
neutral	we
positive	the drivers were there promptly for both drop_off & return , taking all the stress out of travelling .
negative	no fewer than five emails promised a delivery date which was not met .
neutral	overall experience is 0 out 00 .
neutral	apart_from this the car , booking , collection & drop_off were all really good .
neutral	be warned though , it '_s not as easy to do it yourself as it looks on their site / video .
neutral	this was a number of weeks_ago and whilst i understand that the item may still not be available , i would welcome an update email perhaps every three or four weeks .
negative	they lost my order , i have wasted time going to the store several_times , only to be told by a member of staff they didn_'_t receive anything - and that they don_'_t know about delivery to stores at all .
positive	i would highly_recommend !
neutral	they did reply to my written message quite quickly however .
neutral	" 0 x rentokil bed_bug killer ."
negative	she did not answer any of my questions and took a very long time ( i mean 0 mins or more per line ) over each short reply .
negative	it looks_like i will have to take this down the legal route
negative	reason : no stock available from simply ".
positive	:)
positive	i have never used tyre_shopper before but i will be from now on .
negative	i write this so others are careful when ordering from wowcher that delivery charges may apply from the vendors they use .
neutral	we were told not to worry_about it - even_though your literature clearly_states that anyone can enter your room with a lost key .
neutral	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has_been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
negative	you have been_warned !
neutral	just booked car parking at manchester_airport with sky_park , i found the booking forms easy to complete .
negative	i finally visited the store again a week and a half later ( after still not hearing_anything ) to express my disappointment with their lack of service & empathy with the situation .
negative	they look nothing like the picture displayed on the website , my mum has a keen interest in flowers and was upset on how they looked when they were delivered .
neutral	there is no loyalty with interparcel , so i sometimes switch to another parcel service .
neutral	the booking process showed the available fitting slot at my chosen fitter ( tuesday am ).
neutral	however one gets what one pays for i suppose .
positive	vlla mio in calan porter was perfect for all of us including my disabled son .
negative	use again !
neutral	was reluctant to use boohoo due to poor delivery reviews .
negative	their website said it was in stock .
negative	by yodel .
neutral	i just don_'_t understand_why they keep their ( pretty high ) booking_fees !
negative	oh , one more thing , no apology whatsoever !
negative	neither flowers nor delivery worth the money i paid .
negative	i am at my wits_end after constantly telephoning them and if i do get through without the line going dead no one calls me back .
negative	their customer_care and after sales service is very poor .
neutral	the web service was faultless but when i rang the branch to arrange a fitting time the member of staff was totally_unhelpful and somewhat rude in his manner .
negative	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid middlemen making money off everyone and giving really poor service in return !
positive	excellent service would recommend
positive	fantastic price , fantastic product , fantastic delivery time , fantastic service - so in one word : fantastic !
positive	i was also continuous informed via_email of the state of manufacture and the shipping tracking_details .
negative	he calculated our correct bill as just over £_00 - and he would discount this in half to apologise for all of our time spent calling and for the extremely messy drawn - out situation that has occurred .
negative	kingston 00gb class 00 microsdhc card £_00 . 00 delivered , i bought two for £_00 . 00 delivered , checked out via_paypal & the amount changed from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 .
neutral	a map and / or detailed directions on the website would be very useful - and more helpful staff , too !
positive	what else can i say ?
neutral	does exactly_what it says on the tin !
positive	emailed me at every_step of the way , then dropped the money in my account in under a week .
neutral	i ordered this for her_birthday and took into_consideration the delivery time and they still missed it .
positive	ordered some flowers and a gift from serenata_flowers , delivered hassle_free next_day .
positive	very user_friendly website , actually phoned me to make_sure the dose i ordered was correct .
neutral	the size of the information print is ridiculously small and the products really should come with a leaflet in my opinion .
negative	george
positive	alas , i was unavailable at the time , but i then received a second email_saying they ' d attempted delivery with a link to their site where i could organise the redelivery all online .
positive	i '_ll definitely use this place again .
positive	i just entered it on the mazuma website , was immediately given a value for this working order phone and easy to follow_instructions on how to get it , by tracked and insured freepost , to mazuma .
neutral	also it meant that the commentary was at times out of sinc with where we were .
negative	i got so frustrated i tried to contact some of the other people who had posted reviews for the same company .
positive	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to purchase from the company again .
negative	checked the tracking_number to find that the parcel had arrived in the local parcelfarce depot at 0 : 00 in the morning but they couldn_'_t manage to get it into a van for delivery .
neutral	instead of expecting the customer to constantly repeat information on a reply email system that doesnt seem to work .
neutral	overall could be better - stronger trays for the meat - box taped up more - better courier .
negative	i went straight to the letter_box and no card had been left .
negative	it '_s virtually_impossible to speak to anyone on the phone and when you ' re asked to leave a message on their answerphone you can '_t because it '_s not working .
negative	never again :-(
neutral	then sms charges , cancel insurance and booking_fees added with no warning and no option to decline !
negative	i am very disappointed with the service .
negative	i '_ve_used them twice , both_times tempted_by the good prices . never again .
positive	they really go above and beyond for their customers .
neutral	just a quarter full so we had to fill up as soon as we could before setting off .
negative	then 0_weeks after the mot i had to take the car back in because the bearings had gone - after dropping it off , they phoned me an_hour later to tell me that it needed a lot of work or iit wouldn_'_t pass its next mot and when the was the mot due .
neutral	i rang the enquiry number .
positive	it was really easy and quick to search and find my phone and it was clear on the price and details .
negative	will update if anything happens .
neutral	we purchased a mandolin recently .
positive	i don_'_t think you could get better service than that .
neutral	emailed and checked that the replacement cd_player i was ordering was a straight swap / fix .
neutral	it is really antisocial - couldnt wear it to work - what would my clients think .
positive	a would recommend talk_talk they have gd customers service people they expain everthin 0 u simply 0
positive	easy ordering & very helpful when i phoned to query which under_cupboard lights were best for my needs .
neutral	i will use my own optician in future .
negative	am an <_external link_removed_> customer of many_years .
positive	good service and value for money
negative	last_year thompson and morgan performed much the same , this year it , s fothergills , whats up with these seed people , are they that arrogant they think they can get away with it ?
negative	i '_m sadly disgusted they are still trading on line or that they haven_'_t been prosecuted for something related to trading on line or online fraud or robbery .
neutral	courier company ( interlink / dpd ) couldn_'_t shed much light on why and they promised to have it on a ' pre 00 ' delivery the following_day .
neutral	got bf0 ( russian ed ) for 00 £ it was not instant delivery despite the advertising saying it was , i got it after 0 + hours but i did get it in the end .
negative	i always had problems with talktalk , very slow_speeds , videos are almost_impossible to load in peak time , but that is not a big problem as i use internet for work and i don_'_t need to load videos , internet keeps shuting down and then reconnects , it '_s problem after problem and now the smarphones are getting problems to connect too , 0 phones here ( s0 ) always struggling to connect , they keep saying getting ip adress or disabled , i check the router setting panel and there '_s no option like energy_saving so why is the router shutting_down wireless , everybody here already knows where the reset_button just to make you a picture
neutral	the school itself was good .
negative	i waited_until it was valid ( after 0pm the next_day ) and tried to use it .
positive	i am just writing to show my appreciation of your company .
negative	why can '_t tesco be a bit more organized .
neutral	was happy with the product but past experiences ordering online youd normally be kept_upto_date with your order for example
positive	good job !
positive	and you can pay with paypal
negative	when i got my vouchers out to go on a well earned shopping trip minus the kids , i found that they are only valid for 00 months .
neutral	otherwise , i '_m happy .
positive	two months went by with the unused keyboard sitting in the box , ( with me very much considering putting it on ebay ), when found that i was taking a trip back to the states in a couple of weeks .
positive	i would not_hesitate to advise anyone with any_doubts_about buying from the internet to make their first stop off at watchfinder .
negative	company asks for copy of passport to " validate " order .
neutral	not as the picture appeared
negative	pathetic service .
negative	don_'_t get caught out .
negative	then again someone came on wed !
negative	00_hours_later i received an e_- mail saying , ' as a gesture of good will ' they would replace and collect the faulty trolley on the same day - but not to my time_scale and too late for my match !
positive	my doctor has a 0 week waiting list while doctor express dealt_with my complaint straight_away , once they ' re doctor approved my symptoms were adequate to medicine i required they processed my order straight_away .
neutral	i need to know where the food i am eating comes from .
negative	on my return i complained to lastminute . com who point_blank refused to offer us any compensation , the customer_relations guy was to be quiet honest very blunt in his refusal to offer us anything in the way of compensation .
neutral	i could have got the same booker cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	everything fine with product .
positive	excellent !
positive	the postage_charges were extremely reasonable .
positive	excellent price on north_face tent_mules and very quick delivery service , even over christmas_period .
negative	i called them to ask for a refund .
positive	the drawers are not deep enough ( both height and depth
negative	they offered me an_alternative - instead of a direct , up to 0 hrs flight a full day connection with a change .
negative	not normally one to review , however , on this occasion i felt it necessary to warn_others of the extremely poor customer service that will likely be forthcoming when ordering from fitness_superstore .
neutral	i am therefore trying to source the product elsewhere , where the postage will be cheaper ( or free ).
positive	it was very handy having a washing_machine ( having 0 young_children ).
positive	they ' re really beautiful and comfortable !
neutral	size of outfit , xl not available from everywhere
neutral	although the delivery service was very good , the outfit itself wasn_'_t the best fit and did fall_apart towards the end of the evening .
negative	a few_days_later we received a call to say the engineer found no issues with the chair and it was user error !
positive	graeme
positive	i '_ve searched_everywhere for a supplier of essie_nail_polish .
neutral	we got them fixed and they worked for another 00 days then broke_down again !
positive	i was unsure how a service like this would work as i have never done anything like this before but it was user_friendly and i would definitely recommend it to others
neutral	surely transglobal , this is something you could fix quite easily !
neutral	on the front should have been the rear .
negative	the services are relatively expensive and not as customer friendly as they would have you believe .
positive	i had been looking around for a new food_processor for a little while , and kept returning time and time again to magimix .
neutral	excellent products and a wide product range that means dieting is much more achievable as the boredom factor is overcome .
negative	i work away from home all week and needed the parts so that i could do a repair at the weekend .
positive	i placed an order for a product that was hapf the price of products on other site and i got twice as much for my money .
negative	as you will see on twitter , i have had several warnings from people via vianono , that the replacement ticket will not materialise .
negative	utter_rubbish : connection dropping all the time , bandwidth , ping and speed ridiculous .
neutral	i think the dispatch takes too long hence the goods take to long to be delivered
negative	i brought a pair of hunter_wellies that were to big so i sent them back and asked for a refund but i had to foot the cost of return delivery which was £ 0 . 00 totally disgusting would never buy from here again .
positive	i have used floraqueen for the last 0 years & have sent flowers for christmas , birthday '_s and days for what the heck ??
positive	thankyou so much strimmer is now up and running again 😊
positive	my first experience with viovet was a good one .
negative	therefore i never received my refund and am subsequently £_000 ( plus the £_00 delivery fee ) out of pocket .
negative	they lied to the hen all the previous week saying everything was all good and ready .
positive	plus they ' re a lot cheaper_than shops and other_sites .
negative	might want to change your ' best service in europe ' mantra too . would have had better service from my local corner_shop , and they don_'_t even sell guitars !
positive	i '_ve ordered from the chocolate_trading co . twice_now and am impressed with the quality of service i have received .
positive	i get information and advice when i need it , and a rapid transfer of funds .
neutral	goods were to be delivered on a tuesday .
negative	thought i would give asos a try and ordered 0 items .
neutral	however apart_from two beach bars all the resturants are along the main dual carriageway , which you can hear from the villa .
positive	well_done toolstop !
neutral	so its up to you as i say plenty of choice but customer service / satisfaction isn_'_t a high priority , and make_sure you get the right carton or cartons there usually double_boxed just_incase you need to send it back .
neutral	i was out and about when i received the call from the florists so was a little difficult to have a long conversation but no refund was given for same day delivery and also the delivery on the tuesday was very late after 0pm , which i would have thought the florist would have tried to make it one of the first due to being so long after the saturday , i also paid_extra for a medium bouquet and it was not very big , my husband got me flowers for my birthday locally at £_00 and it was much larger , i was at my parents when the bouquet arrived so would have been cheaper for me to buy them locally and take them myself .
neutral	i ordered the tyres and booked fitting on line .
neutral	seems every one can move a 0 bedroom house in a transit regardless of the i finery or volume requirements .
neutral	car_hire point was alittle difficult to find , as it was nowhere_near whether the other hire car_hire points are , it is at completely the opposite end !
positive	i loved that when i chose my glasses , i got two for one discount so that i got a second_pair of the same frames but with sunglass tint .
neutral	the staff were incredibly helpful in assisting me with buying a pair of ski_goggles over the phone and internet .
positive	gosh came so quickly and the quilt_cover is beautiful , about half the price of competitors .
neutral	received balls very quickly , communication excellent .
positive	i emailed simply_supplements and the order was fulfilled free of charge - no_fuss .
neutral	as ever with such web sites you get working solution then someone comes up with a " bright idea " and the process changes .
positive	some of them are see through so you can add colour tissue to make each bag different .
positive	in my case i have the added problem of being terminally_ill and cannot move about too well and most of the time other people have to get my meals , so ready_meals are the best answer .
negative	few_minutes later i received a text_message on my phone saying that they received the bill required for the cash_back and that i would get a cheque within 00 days .
positive	i was a little_sceptical at first of online companies , but this service on rentalcar . com turned_out to be very easy , accurate and much_cheaper .
positive	quick and easy to send phones back and the day they received it , the money was in by bank_account !
positive	had bad_experience with suspected fake product with another_supplier , so was relieved and pleased with authentic product from beauty . com
neutral	in hindsight i would have been better picking flowers up from my local_supermarket on the way home from work .
neutral	order a couple of item , got them ok , they never take too long but yeah but , the thing is , order both item same times to save money , and they charge twice for deliver never happy with that .
positive	right price !
positive	great .
neutral	converted to euro '_s = € 00 . 00 .
neutral	the representative of the company on a pick_up place has cancelled an unnecessary option , it was nice .
positive	well_done gearforgirls !
neutral	the offers they have from time to time are good also but you always find that the stores near you either arnt running the offer or never get alot in of the products on offer .
negative	thanks facebook !
positive	their new player bonus is genuine .
neutral	other times you get a quick and easy service .
positive	arrived quickly and fittedmirrorsandglass were very helpful and responded quickly when i asked ( the night before ) , to ask the courier to put the item in my garden .
positive	the items were as_described and a fast and efficient service

neutral	ordered the item on a thursday_morning .
positive	i was able to order all my travel money online and pick it up at the airport just before i flew out .
positive	we visited buckingham_palace , booking tickets through golden_tours .
negative	.
neutral	i ordered a product in a particular colour and size .
negative	then when arrived came on small lorry that had had the tank loaded on via forklift but the tail_lift was too small for tank to be lowered on so precarious balancing act in getting it off lorry .
neutral	waited and waited for it , no show so after a while i called wallpaper_direct .
neutral	i have used the service before and so feel_confident that i will get good value , however the website twice said " an unexpected error has occurred " and i had to start the transaction again .
neutral	tried the 00hr , 0 day week rentalcars helpline to see if they had any ideas .
positive	fast , safe payment
neutral	ordered 00 ferrules .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was reassured that driver will_definitely call me an_hour before the delivery .
neutral	laser_printer arrived during the 0 day estimated delivery range albeit on the last day of this .
neutral	price - 0 *
negative	it should not be allowed but i blame the relaxed censorship rules for film and television some must get paid by the number of times they can swear .
negative	we understand your concern , however please_note that if the invoice remains unpaid for 0 days then our system will automatically processes it and transfers the escrow amount to seller .
positive	it was obviously the fault off dpd , not audiovisual_online as the dpd bag was ripped through where the damaged cable was and there were crush and wear marks on cable and bag consistent with transit_damage .
neutral	the instruction was to leave with number 00 if the recipient wasn_'_t in
positive	i bought two haynes manuals from np_autoparts .
negative	we went to view our love films this evening , and noticed that we had to re - register with amazon . we were appalled to see that amazon , are now charging prime time fee on all of the films that you may want to watch . so what was free as part of your love_film membership , no_longer stands , and you have to pay to watch the films , in addition to your original membership_fee . appalling , my sons and i could not watch our films , so we watched netflix instead . really disappointed love films member .
positive	we found anyvan on the internet and the item was collected 0 days_later and delivered the same day , at the promised time , carefully_packed and unmarked .
neutral	i felt the the clip_art was very poor .
positive	i was kept advised of progress with sourcing my watch and given really friendly and efficient service on the morning i visited the shop to collect it .
negative	it looked like it was rushed and they couldn_'_t be_arsed to wrap them properly i would like my money back .
positive	i bought a ticket off a very well_known site previous to buying this ticket and this other site proved to be a liability , extortionate and a poor communicator .
positive	i would definitely recommend these_guys
neutral	paid for the 00_hours service to take my things back up to university but it didn_'_t arrive on the day it should have - instead , on the following_day .
neutral	this was by coach to stansted , to france by ryanair and hire_car to the accommodation in france .
neutral	these comments but l '_m not a big person - so l don_'_t know how big people manage
negative	courier didn_'_t collect , customer service poor , would not use again .
positive	the website was easy to navigate .
neutral	i am very disappointed in the prices you charge for the actual product and then the shipping_charges are horrendous , having said that it is worth a one time purchase , but would definately not be able to purchase these items on a regular_basis due to the costs , i went into the tesco and asda sites and saw the regular prices , i also know how much shipping_costs .
neutral	order arrived next_day .
positive	perfect .
neutral	i bought a well - priced ( cheap !)
neutral	however , after my partner had explained firmly their mistake , they did manage to ' squeeze it on the van '.
positive	thank_you .

neutral	the products are superb , educational and fun .
neutral	having telephoned my tuxedo , they sent out two identical white shirts the next_day so all is well , thank_you .
neutral	after my call they were found , despatched and i got them next_day .
negative	so order from this company if you want to order from a company which is registered and hosted in australia , the stock comes from_hong_kong and they have a uk unit where the returns are sent to !
negative	would i use again - absolutely not !
negative	i run a small business and have used myhermes for the last_year sending a few parcels a week with them .
positive	a perfect fit and in place within two hours of arrival .

neutral	good product at a good price !
positive	if i want some more i would go back .

negative	it annoys_me even more that for the same price i paid for 0000 copies of one side only a0_leaflets from leeds i got 0000 double_sided a0 from a local printer and full use of design in future .
neutral	and a 00 week wait for a payout of £ 0 ?

neutral	the next_day rang ecco spoke to a girl who said she would look into it .
neutral	after two month , i wrote again , and still no reply .
positive	dispatch was prompt and the product arrived well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
negative	so after spending money and not completed work , i have to chase this freelancer and peopleperhour got their share , they never contacted me on any occasion to tell that i have to cancel invoice or it will be paid .
negative	as usual tesco didn_'_t tidy up after closing leaving their trolleys strews everywhere including on the paths outside their property and two had been dumped as obstructions in the river .
neutral	there was no_indication that the item was out of stock at the time of ordering ; typically , this was the item i needed most .
neutral	products as expected , good price .
positive	fast , efficient and reliable .
neutral	i called later to ask for a insurance but after a very long security_check and explaining i want insurance the operator actualy asked if i wanted to be put through to a insurance company !
neutral	when we eventually found it [ after a huge fall - out ].
negative	he had however started up two more companies mk exhibition and movey ( a video - making business ) and he also runs a company called salesmanaged in milton_keynes .
neutral	i have used this company on several_occasions before and have been very happy with the flowers delivered and the service .
positive	then the following_day . a third .
neutral	when we needed an_urgent bridging loan they told us basically to forget it .
negative	it is now the 00th_december and items have not yet arrived .
neutral	chose this supplier over several others who had same product because they had next_day free delivery .
neutral	when the tickets arrived i was shocked to find i had paid double what the ticket stated
neutral	they told me they would look into it .
negative	stay_away they have done nothing but con me out of 00_euros .
positive	booking process was fast and simple , really pleased !
positive	i have been impressed by the efficient service and excellent prints all at a very reasonable price .
negative	when i took the flowers out and put them in a vase they toppled out as the stems had been cut too short .
neutral	i therefore find spartoo discourteous and a disappointment in their attitude to customer service .
negative	be aware that paying out bonuses is discretionary ( read small_print )
neutral	no_problems with car but as yet but no aftersales feedback queries from the dealer !
negative	ordered my lenses on a wednesday .
neutral	if the deal i '_ve paid for asks for a deposit of £_00 i expect to pay £_00 and no more than that .
positive	it '_s not the first time i '_ve_used urban_industries and it definitely wont be the last !
negative	i placed the order and received a confirmation , also paying for expedited delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the quality of the print was very poor , akin to a £_00 inkjet on normal / draft settings .
positive	the description on website was very accurate and the fact that there 0 different channel widths to choose from was ideal .
neutral	the internet booking was fine , the fitting of the tyres with the tracking etc all completed on time
negative	ordered a set of knobs .
negative	upon our insistence , after contact archos , they agreed for us to return the machine to them but that was 0 months_ago .
negative	they advise me to place order again by splitting into smaller orders but refuse to tell me what size order is ok .
negative	he did not deny it and his carefully crafted words spoke volumes .
negative	ebookers charged the same number of pounds_sterling as vueling charged in euros , ie ebookers was around 00_% more_expensive than if i had booked direct with the airline
negative	' miss xxx ' did not believe a word i said and was more interested in challenging the above details than sending me the joiner '_s package - she suggested it had got lost in the post ( i order a lot on the internet and nothing has_been lost to date ) - and challenged my message - leaving technique saying mobile messages are difficult to understand ( i was using a landline ) .
neutral	after about half an_hour however , i was given two cars ; the second one without charge .
neutral	as above to date waiting 0 days_later
negative	it was already 0pm and she had received nothing and it was not going to bear any resemblance to the beautiful yellow and purple bunch i had chosen . but i agreed , as it was very late in the day .
neutral	however , surely a company the size of europcar could have basic vehicle instructions in 0 or three european languages .
negative	i '_ve ordered twice_now and both orders were delivered incomplete .
negative	!, it might miss a bug or 0 but so do these_people !
negative	please remove my details from your mailing_list .
positive	next_morning delivery . and sure_enough it arrived before_noon . no looking back , so sorry argos , you and your 00 days for delivery are history !
negative	i sent them on june 00rd .
neutral	i also wanted to add another driver who was arriving two_days_later .
positive	very easy to find the right tyres . even for a bird !
negative	was advised that this would be dleivered before this time as there is usually a 00 hour delivery turnaround .
positive	got my stanley level at a good price and quickly .
positive	ordering was easy , the photos were good , so you know what you are getting and then they delivered them on easter_sunday that is impressive .
neutral	i did not receive a response to my subsequent email .
neutral	first order delivered on time and correct_address
neutral	left not knowing if that part will suffice or not , so back to the mechanic .
neutral	i contacted them again , to be advised that it would now be dispatched the end of that week . that end of week came and nothing !
neutral	won_'_t be able to get glasses and phone in it !
negative	went to the shop to return the item , with my receipt and the original packaging and coat ( paid £ 0 . 00 to park at the car_park in the shopping centre ) was told that they could not accept it as i didn_'_t have the correct returns_label and they could only give me an exchange .
neutral	i thought this excessive as this an internet service and people will inevitably want to exchange or return goods so i will probably not use them again .
negative	if you don_'_t believe me , just google them and read other horror_stories for yourself .
positive	from finding atlantic_signs on google - ordering - designing and delivery i have been absolutely_delighted with the whole_process .
negative	sent me four tubes for my fish_tank , two were labelled the wrong_colour and one did not work .
neutral	i like ordering from muscle_food , but repeated problems with deliveries will put me off using them again .
neutral	when i initially started_using them i could order in the evening , it was marked as sent the following_morning and arrived the next_day .
positive	then i remembered chemist_direct , so i went straight online and ordered some frontline_spot - on .
positive	a quick update to say that my garden is now finished and my rotary_washing line has_been installed - had it set in concrete - and is in use on a daily_basis .
positive	they also kept me informed during the process and i would recommend them unreservedly .
neutral	000_% check before it leaves ( save yourselves in transport costs .)
neutral	original review :
positive	the mower i ordered on line a . m . was in stock and delivery next_day was promised .
negative	is it your policy to try and ruin hard working customers holidays before they have even begun ?
neutral	this mattress is not as bumpy as most and very good for just £_00 .
positive	i '_m often disappointed with either the service or product from mail order companies but this company has renewed my faith in internet_shopping .
neutral	it is a family run hotel but the children were a nuisance with their screams at sunset .
positive	swift , reliable and went beyond the call of duty to ensure that i was sorted .
neutral	the shed was of dissapointing quality .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	jeg føler at jeg_har spildt 000_kr .
neutral	i am very embarassed as i had been given the job to order the flowers as a surprise for my friends birthday .
negative	very bad customer service .
positive	thank_you .
positive	my main focus was on price and after_searching loads of different costume suppliers i came_across escapade .
neutral	after two phone_calls still_waiting for the replacement cheque which i am assured is in the system .
neutral	thanks to my advisors we were able to negotiate with my creditors a realistic monthly payment plan .
neutral	ordered the plaza bathroom_suite with left - hand shower bath , wastes and " cube " basin / bath_mixer_taps at the end of april on the last day of the current promotion ( the suite has since gone back on sale at the same price so bear this in mind if you are rushing to order to meet an offer end - date !).
positive	good price too
negative	!
positive	i contacted parts_gateway because i needed a wheel in a hurry ; i entered my details on the website , and within 00_mins i had 0 offers !
negative	disappointed with the flowers i ordered , i normally order from interflower , and the flowers are much more substantial there , usually for a cheaper price , but i decided to use yourselves instead , there was 00 roses as ordered , but they were very small , there wasn_'_t much attention to detail either .
positive	james was very helpful both by email and telephone
negative	not an_automated email .
neutral	and that was strange ?
neutral	other than that i worked_fine .
positive	will be my first choice for comparing_prices and will undoubtedly use again .
negative	they really are terrible .
negative	argos refuse to help me , i only want to replace my kitchen_doors .
neutral	as i had a nubuck cleaning block i was able to remove them ( 00_%) & decided not to return as i need them next week .
negative	we are now on the 00th day after ordering and they can not get an answer from their couriers to say where it was delivered and who signed for it , i have now spoken to 0 online operators , 0 managers and the saga goes on .
neutral	unfortunately my partner had already put the blind up when i realised there was a hitch of material right through the middle of it so because of this i don_'_t pull it down fully because it '_s very noticeable .
neutral	taps uk said i would get the sink in 0 days , i got it 00 days_later only because of the courier company ,,, taps uk did their job efficiently but they will suffer criticism because of the courier they use .
neutral	my only_concern is ( and this has happened before ) the colours of the mountings on the the website bare no relationship to the colours you actually get .
negative	bought wowcher deal , money came out twice and didnt receive voucher , although i contacted them before deal expired by the time it was established my card payment was authourised the deal was finished so here i am , no voucher for uk break and £_000 out of my credit_card .
positive	goods arrived as and when promised
negative	then , after id changed my order , they emailed me to say it did qualify but my new order didn_'_t .
neutral	it arrived very quickly and is like new condition .
positive	delivery was really quick too , i would definately use them again and would highly_recommend to people trying to conceive .
positive	the community on the forums is ( for the most part ) also a very friendly / helpful one .
negative	their client service refused to cancel the transaction .
negative	!
negative	i have to post back to you that trying to find where i leave from in venice for the greek ferry ( anek ) has_been totally problematic .
neutral	had i not needed to exchange this i might not have minded but as i did ( and experienced severe days - rubbersole don_'_t seem to have correctly linked up with the connect_+ service so make_sure you keep your proof of posting !)
negative	don_'_t trust them .
negative	!
negative	i received an e_- mail back telling_me that i couldn_'_t cancel the order but that i could return it as soon as it arrived and that it would take 0_weeks for the money to go back into my account .
positive	was kept_informed by both text_message and email every_step of the way .
negative	that was 00th_february .
negative	still_waiting for my goods after 0_weeks .
negative	this is obviously nonsense and a lie , why describe them as 00x00 ?
neutral	goods arrived over 0_weeks after ordered so although good quality they were in fact much later than_expected .
negative	ridiculous !
positive	had an old pair of sennheiser_headphones that i wanted to give to a colleague at work so she could use them with dictation equipment .
positive	would highly_recommend to anyone .
positive	i would definetely recommend this company to anybody .
neutral	delivery day came i had the buggy but no change bag ???
neutral	i said this was his responsibility and he agreed to check it out for me .
neutral	this shower_rail is well_designed and finished , altogether a stylish product , but i was disappointed to find its length comes in two parts with an inevitably flimsy connection .
negative	the third and final time they came i was luckily in a led the beleaguered driver to the obvious wood shed to retrieve the trousers - he claimed he had no information about an_alternative collection_point or that the company was meant to txt the delivery day .
positive	the on screen experience is easy and very informative with an exhaustive choice of flights and hotels and the prices are rarely bettered .
positive	offered very good deal and would definitely deal with them again .
negative	ordered and paid for two tyres online , only to have an email_telling_me the tyres i ordered are not available , and the only alternatives were £_00 dearer .
negative	i called kahuna who produce the watches and despite two phone_calls from them to watchshop asking them to contact me and promising them promising to do so , watchshop did not call me .
positive	they appear to be of a really high_quality , time will tell throu of course .
neutral	they probably call it smart marketing , or some such .
positive	a great firm that gives great service .
positive	was refunded without problem and tracking was provided for parcel .
neutral	that is what was said in about 0 cases and only twice did they . i felt we had to do all the chasing as are new nissan was due on a monday but made several phone_calls then found out it was delayed . ah well we got it and are pleased with the car at_least .
positive	prices are some of the lowest on the internet and buying branded products means you know what you ' re buying .
neutral	great product and now happy .
positive	the service i have received from printerland has_been first_class , the sales staff are very helpful and very well informed .
neutral	it would have been nice considering the expense of the item .
negative	poor , poor , poor .
neutral	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
negative	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
neutral	the call back from servicing_stop was the big surprise as they firstly told me the tracking cost was £_00 .!!
neutral	finally , later than they said it would be ready , a new drive was returned to us .
positive	no_problems , so all good !
positive	using teacher profiles is a good way of ensuring that the learning needs of the child can be met .
negative	absolutely_disgusting !!
neutral	i am happy that quality control spotted the mistake but i should have been informed not left_wondering where my order was .
negative	we ordered a semi - integrated_dishwasher - the ordering_process was good , but the delivery process is another matter entirely .
negative	yes nectar is all left clcik and not right :-) :-) lol .
neutral	she was quite insistent and if it had been my 00_yr_old dad on the phone he would have been made to feel that he should take this .
neutral	be warned !!!!
negative	if ever i have a client come to me and say that the product we supplied to him is of absolutely no use to them and they are now out of pocket to the full value of that product , that the product we supplied to them is still new , fully_functional and has not been ' consumed ' in any way and that we could swap that product for the correct one without_any consequence to us , then i hope i will do just that rather_than referring them to our terms and conditions .
negative	this did not happen .
neutral	kept in a q for 00_minutes and then was cut_off .
negative	they told me they could offer to redeliver or refund .
positive	however , that is not their fault but down to e . u .
negative	orange should be struck off or something !
neutral	this is my review of the pyrex smok aro
negative	ee this and get in touch lol .
positive	personally , along with a good diet consisting of all the right foods to maintain and promote muscle_growth ( along with an exercise routine ), the above protein snacks offer a great way of adding extra protein to my diet .
neutral	took 0 phone_calls and i ended_up doing a conference_call with the hotel and lastminute . com to get a full_refund .
negative	yep - it has taken this long for printerpix to get a replacement back to me !
positive	they were a great price and postage was free .
positive	it was dead easy to order , straight_forward .
negative	do they really think we are stupid enough to believe these judges know what they are talking_about .
neutral	on the other hand wowcher offers some good deals .
negative	sleepless_nights .
neutral	easirent was the carhire company
positive	andy .
positive	i couldn_'_t believe it , and the prices are competitive too .
negative	it '_s still retail - and it '_s still contract law .
neutral	!
neutral	i didn `_t find the female_member of staff very courteous .
neutral	i had to buy a new mains charger when i got fed_up with trying to have a permanently charged battery at work and home .
positive	very happy with purchase .
positive	will_definitely shop again !
neutral	this is the only site where i have to pay to return goods .
negative	found myself argueing over £_00 via_email .
negative	!
negative	didn_'_t get them at marked delivery day so i phoned tesco direct to ask what happened .
negative	i have sent 0 emails and am awaiting a reply , which i suspect i either wont get or they will ignore the content .
positive	!
negative	over a week_later , was e_- mailed to say it was out of stock , order had been cancelled and card refunded .
negative	one person tells you one thing while another person tells you something_else .
negative	up until recently i would have said lovely , always helpful .
positive	i will definitely be shopping here again .
positive	i loved that they had an amazing range of styles to choose from .
negative	i strongly_recommend not to touch evans website with a barge_pole for any high value purchases .
negative	i asked if this would be a seemless transition as my office of some 0 persons relied on this connection .
positive	an effortless transaction !
positive	i '_ve saved_myself a lot of money .
positive	when i tried on the clothing item in question i found it to be too big ( my mistake not theirs ).
neutral	£ 0 each flower
negative	the last phone_call was over an_hour & i '_ve now been promised a refund for the line rental that i paid in_advance .
neutral	", i felt that the flowers that were delivered were substantially different than those pictured .
positive	have bought from here before and will do many more times .
negative	totally_unacceptable - very upsetting
positive	you can be confident .
negative	i am_currently searching for another company to join .
negative	headphones never came after more than a month .
negative	my experiences include : item arriving several days_later than_expected when paying for delivery on a particular day ; the item arriving damaged ; no response from fs to numerous_emails sent regarding a replacement part for the item ; phone_calls being forwarded to voicemail rather_than to an operator ; finally upon speaking to a representative being told they would need to speak with a manager and would get back to me , however subsequently receiving no further contact .
neutral	usually good service but in this instance i was sent the wrong jeans and the returns process resulted_in a refund rather_than resending the correct pair , which where now out of stock .
positive	which happens quite often these days .
positive	brilliant service , advice and parts .
negative	do you think expedia care ????
neutral	whilst their prices are brilliant i feel that their customer service leaves a lot to be desired as i bought an iron from them 0 month_ago and it broke .
neutral	no , i am told .
positive	the flowers are always a long_lasting quality and well_packed .
neutral	products dispatched promptly
positive	never used you guys before but good value and quick deliver .
neutral	other than that the car was ok and the value for money good .

negative	tradeinn customer service
negative	we asked the reception staff to send him on his 0 hour journey without us .
positive	speedy delivery .
negative	our rates are the same for both readings as we no_longer have ' economy 0 '.
positive	will_definately order again
positive	skis arrive beautifully_wrapped and properly prepared and waxed , not just slung in a box like a lot of other_retailers .
positive	easy to order , really good price and quick delivery
neutral	however , the product did arrive in a reasonable amount of time and i am pleased with the camera .
neutral	did some_research afterwards and found out the info of the package , there was no way it was free .
positive	thank_you so much i was very impressed at how quick the phone cover came after i ordered it for my wife and she is very happy with her purchase
positive	would definitely use this site again .
positive	excellent service - very rapid and helpful
positive	i was very pleased with this company .
positive	doorstuff supplied all the fittings to make the project go really smoothly .
neutral	i have not had a reply .
positive	i would certainly add this company to my list of outdoor websites as they are brilliantly organised and know their stuff .
neutral	in their favour gear0music did respond very well after i alerted them to the fact that my product hadn_'_t been delivered and then later found out when i left the house that morning that it had actually been left on my doorstep overnight .
neutral	perhaps an_apology would have been more appropriate rather_than telling_me i am wrong ? this is a good example of my experience !
negative	we agreed i would like a refund , and amanda arranged a courier to collect it .
positive	would recommend to others with similar cases to mine
neutral	unfortunately , there was nothing on the outside of the parcel to indicate this and i had to arrange for the parcel to be redelivered as i was out at the time of the original delivery .
neutral	manchester_airport is easy to use & handy , parking is expensive , but parking away from the airport is unreliable
neutral	please treat this as an_urgent matter .
negative	linda called to say that they had the part delivered but they had " lost it or someone has taken it for another job ".
positive	there was a slight_hiccup on the booking website when it didn_'_t recognise my car type , a problem which the call_centre were already aware of when i called them .
positive	the item arrived within a couple of days and was of a very good quality .
neutral	i asked if they would send me the confirmation_email and was told it was on its way . 00_hours_later i rang again as nothing had arrived .
positive	the cello tv is easy to tune , the picture is excellent but the sound a bit tinny .
positive	it arrived promptly and was very well_packaged to avoid_damage .
neutral	my milano cayos rads turned_up and i '_m pretty impressed .
neutral	they only had a standard double at the back of the house .
negative	using this company illustrates just why public services often maintain such a poor public image .
negative	hahah .
positive	would definitely use again .
positive	i have not had reason to need to contact them as far as customer service is concerned , however i would use them again .
neutral	rang animed .
negative	first they sent a text to my wife saying that the delivery would be here “. anytime_between_0am and 00 . 00_hours ”.
negative	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
negative	i used the lift away , and that only used the dust setting .
neutral	i was greeted_by an un helpful and unprofessional gentleman_who was not interested in helping_me .
positive	e . stannard
negative	this is the response ,.
neutral	overall the buying experience was good but i did hav a 00_%_discount_code which was accepted at checkout but then when i paid with paypal the discount vanished .
neutral	i '_ve played sky_vegas in the same time span , and had 0 £_000 jackpots on games the same as virgin_games have .

neutral	the price was excellent compared to anywhere_else .
positive	joshua johns told me it was time i started incorporating supplements into my workout routine ( s ) i was very skeptical .
neutral	provider seemed to be marginal compared to main hire_companies
neutral	one final warning if you do decide to stay : when leaving your room , hide any newspapers that you are reading , as the housekeeper has a tendency to remove them from the room .
positive	can '_t fault the service in any way .
negative	also hsbc online_banking is not safe , they do not use safe device , which caused lots of accounts hacked .
positive	!
negative	however , the bouquet on arrival looked tired , lack lustre and had flowers staring to wilt .
negative	no !
negative	emailed support , over 0 days and all i '_ve had is a automated_response .
negative	in fact i received an emailing another 00_hours_later stating that my handset had been recieved followed_by another email only a few minutes later downgrading my original quote by over £_000 !
negative	i will not be using this site again , back to interflora .
neutral	i will highly_recommend this company irresppective of my experience with the hope tnt will not be in charge of delivery .

positive	good communication , swift delivery happy with purchase .
neutral	we did manage to get another staff_member a few minutes later just as i was primed for leaving and going elsewhere , he was quite helpful to be fair .
positive	my fridge_/_freezer was delivered within 0_days as i requested , within a time_slot .
negative	they could deliver the next_day and leave in a safe_place .
positive	very friendly , knowledgeable and willing to help .
neutral	would i buy from ao again ?
neutral	but the fitting company you recommened to fit my tyres were a let_down , their attitude was poor , i felt it was because they were not supplying the tyres also i do not like tyre_fitters who use who use air powered tools to tighten wheel_nuts .
neutral	the salesman dismissed us immediately when he realised we could not buy the couch we wanted due to it not being the correct_size , there was no offer to look at alternatives with us .
positive	the web_site is very clear , easy to find your way arround .
neutral	disappointing .
negative	i placed an order for a ps0_game on 00th_april - marked next_day dispatch expected delivery 00 april , for my son '_s birthday
negative	when or if the costume does turn_up i will not be needing it now .
positive	you know when you are expecting something to be pretty awesome , but then you get it and it still way exceeds your expectations .
negative	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
positive	i ordered my rug on the friday , they emailed me on the monday saying it had been dispatched and gave_me a link to track my delivery so i could be sure to be in when it arrived .
neutral	it should be much_cheaper or free , to return items bought , if they don_'_t fit properly .
neutral	front desk staff were very friendly and amicable both on pickup and dropoff .
positive	my husband received the furniture and it was brought into our house with care .
negative	friday 00th_may - whey hey i finally have taken delivery of my order ( over 0_weeks after ordering !)
negative	june_00th : : well look into it , and you call back " - they didn_'_t !
negative	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn_'_t bother to give customers their phone number .
positive	the people i think of first to help me , are within the rla .
positive	i then contacted the company by telephone to ask a few supplementary questions . ' could we get two cars in the parking_space ?'.
positive	it '_s great if we are visiting a new city or town i scroll_through and read up on the nearest quality eateries .
negative	on this occasion it was a pair of flip_flops that took two delivery attempts !
neutral	on opening the rubber selledhet get it tolerable .
neutral	we are really pleased with the quality of the furniture purchased .
positive	" nd rug bought from the company in the last 0 months and i will be definetly be going back there .
positive	the only_criticism i have is that the tints are unavailable to select for a home_trial so i felt it was a bit of a gamble - luckily it worked out fine for me !
negative	treated with suspicion .
neutral	a big plus was the sale on the cooker and got a bargain on a neff oven so all in all not terrible but not great either .
positive	very easy to use , great price .
positive	really happy with the skis , fast free delivery and was delighted with the free poles that i did not expect .
negative	incredible .
positive	easy to order on line , much_cheaper_than the vets and very fast delivery .
positive	like most people struggling with debt i found the wealth of options daunting and stressful in itself .
negative	nothing lasts more than 0 washes . quality control sucks .
negative	i told them that £_00 will not excuse bad workmanship or bad service & ask what my options were .
negative	i am so angry and frustrated by this company but there doesn_'_t seem to be anyone who will take_responsibility for this .
neutral	so i really don_'_t think they were worth what i paid and there wernt any flowers added either .
positive	i received the goods the day after_placing the order , excellent service .
positive	i looked around at companies , chose to go with petrolscooter . co . uk as they were priced well and have an array of products .
positive	i will be staying with this treatment .
positive	for these reasons it is my preferred choice .
negative	i sent them an iphone_0s on a thursday via special delivery , which was signed for on the friday_morning .
neutral	as i live locally to the source of my last purchase , i went in person to pick_up the article , thinking the vendor would make some reduction because he was not having to finance the delivery .
negative	it had been so bent that i was unable to assemble the wheel to the bike frame .
positive	ao were great .
negative	i also believe this could be argued to be theft .
positive	we would most certainly recommend dry it out for any of your heating requirements .
negative	what the whole_thing boils down to , which is plain to see , is the fact that they never had the item that they were advertising in the first place , and i '_ve read on several other review sites that they '_ve done the very same thing to other customers as well , that is dispatch essentials releases of ps0_games when they ' re advertising the full original release .
negative	' availability ' email btw means no stock - and i believe they knew it when the order was taken on the website .
negative	never buy from them again .
positive	it only took a few_days and the money was clear in my account .
positive	will be using them again
negative	one to avoid .
neutral	i am at my place of work all day and apparently the delivery driver tried twice and left a card ( there is only one office door ).
positive	i order many covers for my company phones .
positive	would recomend and use again
positive	( trust me i have tried many !)
negative	you ' d think ordering a simple beverage would be as simple as either opening a can or filling the glass up from a dispenser .

neutral	quidco is worth using for most of the offers / cashback available .
neutral	none !
neutral	disappointed with the delivery time . takes too long .
neutral	slightly_disappointed !
positive	also , great customer_services , with quick polite reply to my query .
positive	my appointment was with zoey ; she was very nice indeed , very knowledgeable , honest , calming and best of all no_pressure was levied on me – i almost felt like she wanted me to go away and have a think but on impulse i ordered a ring there and then !
neutral	i had to tighten the arms and clean before i could wear them .
neutral	huge problems getting in contact with the company and 00 day delivery time caused me a lot of worry - i honestly thought i ' d been_scammed .
negative	good luck with that attitude .
positive	from_start to finish the service was excellent and very well_organised , and the furniture i ordered was of a very high_quality and well_worth what i paid for them .
negative	now 00st nov & still not received it !!

neutral	in general .
positive	i would highly_recommend your company to family & friends and would not_hesitate to use again in the future .
negative	if you cant handle the orders dont take peoples money !
neutral	arrived on time but quite cheap considering what i paid
negative	the average response time for an answer is currently : 0 hrs for the ticket to be resolved .
neutral	but the mother - in - law will get her flowers - i hope
neutral	instead the shop has just kept quiet .
neutral	what did concern me was that i have an expensive car that i do cherish ., there was no personnel visible .
neutral	at the office i had to wait 00_minutes before anyone came to the counter .
positive	they have friendly , helpful , knowledgeable_staff , who are able to deal with any ram requirements .
positive	brilliant service , ordered in the morning and it arrived the next_day

positive	they even e_- mailed me to inform_me when they were moving premises to make me aware of any possible delays and suggested dates to order products to ensure a continuation of supply .
neutral	i '_m sorry to have to submit the lowest rating so_far , but i must be truthful in my opinion .
positive	i use parcelhero . com because they have proved to me that i can_trust them to deliver the goods !
positive	very pleased with product as it was just as advertised .
positive	best rates and fees in uk
neutral	we actually had to go to a local_supermarket and pay for them to add an additional bouquet and wrap with more acceptable trimmings .
positive	the people i corresponded with by email and by telephone were very helpful and sent a replacement very quickly .
negative	the customer service team would not issue new tyres or a refund without checking the tyres on a photo first .
positive	service great too - they came exactly on time and i was kept in touch with when to expect them .
negative	the company are still selling vouchers
positive	the table needs to have the legs installed and you have to apply a coating of the supplied wax ; do this to the legs before you install them , and once the legs are in place you need to turn it over - and oh_yes , it weighs a lot .
negative	me i asked ?
negative	was told delivery will be before the 00th but no delivery today ,
positive	excellent quality .
negative	i had to chase them to find out what had happened and they only get back to you via_email .

positive	top shelf guys .
neutral	old ships used , food needs improvement , infrequent sailings
positive	thank_you so much for preserving these precious_memories for us .
neutral	easy to contact customer support if needed .
positive	the product ( yamaha hs00m speakers ) is excellent !
neutral	the box was stamped as standard , which it obviously is .
negative	the chap at national was very pleasant but said that there was no record of the order on his system so he took my details to investigate .
positive	i '_m delighted with it .
negative	you ' d think this would be a straight_forward task , but after much_deliberation with customer_services , they finally gave in and accepted that it was indeed a fault with the home home a week_later .
negative	there was damage to the flowers & leaves .
negative	i need my phone it '_s vital
negative	the supplier should not be allowed to select products for you that you have to click to deselect .
neutral	there is no system to log in and gain updates of your purchase nor any emails saying your purchase is in the warehouse or ready to be dispatched .
neutral	once ordered the service was pretty quick .
neutral	then i was sent 0 contract notes so i had in fact doubled my trade .
positive	finding the exact memory i needed was easy , the price seemed to be perfect and the delivery time was great !
negative	but then tell me this before the whole day has_gone !
positive	using dpd as the courier was also particularly impressive .
neutral	unfortunately , the freebie item was no_longer included .
positive	why would anyone ever buy from the high_street when you can get this quality of service at this price ?
negative	i recently had to return a faulty jacket that i had purchased only 0_months prior and was very disappointed withe level of customer service i received .
neutral	the only_downside was the price of the ubiquitous photographs that are taken at the start of the visit and very hard to avoid ( without being rude ).
negative	the cushions are not made of an appropriate material .
positive	the free returns_policy will not be needed which does not surprise me as timberland are extremely well made shoes .
negative	this was no good as they were a birthday surprise .
positive	i needed a pirate_costume for my daughter and to be honest i felt that having to buy a costume on top of buying a birthday_present was quite a lot to ask .
positive	once i had ordered the bike i was informed of its whereabouts and what stage it was at .
neutral	admittedly it was newish but not brand_new .
positive	fast service , fantastic blind and it looks great .
neutral	small trophy was packaged in an_enormous cardboard_box with tons of foam - waste for you .
neutral	we don_'_t have them after all ".

negative	robin
negative	complete con .
negative	i wasn_'_t shown around the area for some reason , so the actual conditions and facilities remained a mystery to me .
neutral	they cannot be contacted by telephone and their tracking site it completly useless .
neutral	the communication from the company was really good , keeping_me up to date on how the order was progressing and the glasses arrived about a ten days_later which was faster_than i had expected .
neutral	there is a lot of competition for our business online so next time i '_ll look at another e_- florist ?
positive	very happy with this compamy .
positive	the price i have paid questor for this cover is 00_% lower_than the quote from my travel company .
neutral	oz

positive	partmaster , says it all very quick delivery as well
positive	both arrived really quickly in well_protected packaging ; comms with selectspecs was just right , not excessive or sparse ; overall really impressed !
negative	was that enough for your purposes ?
neutral	good trip at a reasonable price but food prices are steep !
negative	asked if she could chase_up but she said no as 0000s of items were there .
neutral	had to ring the company who gave_me the driver '_s number rang him explained where i lived as i thought he must have gone to the wrong place before .
positive	fantastic designs , friendly professional staff , and a very clean shop .
negative	it is now the 0th_oct and no sign of our goods .
negative	we received a text on the 0th to say delivery would now be the 0th ( i have the original e_mail with stating the 00th ).
negative	i said 00 times that i am not interested , but still trying tom push !
negative	0 .
neutral	i '_ve_used resort_hopper for years with no problem but i think they '_ve changed the coach service they use at barcelona .
positive	rang up initially to get advice re sizes as i couldn_'_t make up my mind between small and large .
negative	having made 0 calls to iflorist and finding out nothing in regards to the where_abouts of my flowers , i had to ring round all the florists in my town to find out who had " delivered " them ( iflorists would not tell me the name !)
neutral	there is no chance of this .
positive	great glasses ( rayban rx0000 - new wayfarer ( 0 / 0 )) and good service .
neutral	however unfortunately i had the cardamom_chicken the other night and despite enjoying it whilst eating it after i suffered with some unwanted illness , both me and my boyfriend shared it and found ourselves with crunching stomache aches and symptoms similar to food_poisoning .
positive	found this supplier and was the best priced out there !
negative	terrible customer service , and just look at all of these negative_reviews ; we can '_t all be wrong , surely ?
negative	was good enough quality but with the extra vat added on was very expensive for the products i recieved .
neutral	the sales_man on the phone spun a tale around ' sales ' prices and recommended to order the product i wanted the same day as the price could not be held .
neutral	the product looks great but their customer service is poor , yet another company that makes promises that just let the customer down and do not give a truthful straight_forward answer .
negative	emails just seem to go into a black_hole and get ignored .
neutral	totally enjoyed the actual tour and enjoyed the cheerful banter of the first tour rep .
positive	she will be made up .
neutral	hope that someone would help me sort it out !!!!
negative	needless to say that phone conversation never happened .
negative	0 days_later they called to say that the item (' in stock ') on the website was actually out of stock and would not even reach their warehouse for nearly three_weeks .
positive	simple ordering system followed_by swift delivery .
neutral	very quick dispatch .
positive	fast and professional service as always .
positive	was very happy with the service especially as i had to exchange my original order .
positive	i entered the key number on the order form and sent it off on line .
positive	great choice as was shopping for a birthday_present .
positive	i regularly checked out the latest ultraportable machines but could never bring myself to shell out the considerable investment required .
positive	i ordered osmo hard wax from wood fiinishes direct .
positive	delighted
negative	looks like i '_ve had the same experience as most on this site .
positive	i have to say this garage is a breath of fresh_air !!
negative	very disappointed .
negative	generally they arrive two_days_later and at a push three .
negative	now i '_m not hopeful of receiving the product or the refund and i don_'_t expect they ' re even remotely bothered about yet more bad_publicity .
negative	i sent an invoice i had from the company and imagined i would see my review live again .
neutral	on that live_chat i filled in my question details and order number for the operator to then ask me my order number again after 00_mins .
negative	so basically they have had my money for 0_weeks now , not had to pay for anything at all .
positive	have used feedem for years , always well priced with good communication , easy to use web_site and prompt deliveries .
neutral	initial high_standard somewhat wilted with latest experience .
positive	fantastic worktop and fast delivery , thanks
negative	its now march 00th and i still_haven_'_t seen any refund to my account .
neutral	in the end , i was forced to order it to my home address but customer_services never made any further attempt to contact me .
positive	this sale was very efficiently carried_out .
negative	ordered on 00th_october , now 0rd november .
negative	i also lost a day of holiday for the trouble ( a day i could have spent with my new_born baby ).
negative	as well as the health risks , the food wastage is enormous .
negative	it may have been my fault that we lost the receipt and it may very well be the store policy not to offer refunds without it but firstly the phoneline and the stores should not give out conflicting_information and a customer service manager should learn to deal with customer complaints in a friendly and understanding manner .
neutral	numerous_attempts later & lost credit & finally reaching my dialled destination .
positive	?
negative	even if i have to pay that little_bit more , the service has got to be better_than the problems i '_ve encountered from dpd today .
positive	recommend them to all our friends !
neutral	but the friction in my case was the impossibility to modify or cancel the order once i did and pay it .
neutral	veronica
negative	very unhappy
positive	i ordered on wednesday_afternoon and received my goods on thursday_morning , a fast and efficient service and i woul certainly use stitcher again .
positive	envirofone took 0 days to send a sales pack , the phones then took 0 days in the post ( the prepaid_envelope was not first_class ), the phones were then tested the day after they received them and the money was transferred to me the day after that .
negative	!
neutral	however , when i contacted serenata_flowers they replied quickly and asked if i wanted a refund .
neutral	i only used them once online and that was more than enough for me .
negative	should be banned from the internet , a complete_joke .
negative	i sent another email and eventually got a response that they '_d contact their depot to arrange despatch .
positive	i ordered 00 sticks to get me started and will_definitely be using usb0u as my supplier in the future .
negative	this is the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
positive	the packaging was great with airbags to protect the stars , all inside a strong box and with delivery within_00hrs , great service , highly_recommended .
positive	products arrived within 00_hours without excessive_packaging which i thought was great .
positive	fantastic and easy website to navigate .
neutral	not in pressed very few flowers
negative	nothing .
neutral	i raised an order for some polishing kits where the price was significantly_reduced on the website .
negative	waited in all day and arrived early evening . no good .
negative	day 0 - no parcel
neutral	i had to laugh though when 0_days ago i received an_email_stating my item had been shipped , it has_been sitting in my mothers lounge since christmas day !
neutral	can '_t review meet &_greet_parking service yet as have just booked and been asked for review already by skyparksecure .
positive	buying from d amd m powertools is never a problem , everything runs_smoothly they have a rewards_program , fast delivery i do not buy from anywhere_else
negative	0_weeks_later the deck belt broke , i rang again .
positive	got the transfer and cleared in the bank in 0 days !!
neutral	well_done , fantastic customer service .
positive	would definitely use travelpharm again and would recommend to anyone .
positive	very user_friendly no_hassle website .
neutral	when you order a sink then you expect the sales_person would ensure that all items to produce a fully_functional sink are included .
neutral	hard to give any review as i '_m still_waiting for
neutral	checked tracking site the following_day , which showed goods had reached the a depot .
neutral	will let you know when it is delivered !!!
positive	good prices and communication
negative	i received an order that i did not want but simple supp do not like giving refunds so i have to buy more goods to retreve my money not happy with this way of doing_business
neutral	they have people that pick_up parcels in there car then store them in there garage then hand them to hermes vans .
neutral	it would have just been nice to have been informed by the courier of the delay .
negative	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
positive	apart_from a short wait the item was received prior to the date specified and a nice addition was the additional lens cloth incuded with the sunglasses which i feel is supirior to the one provided by rayban .
neutral	not happy at all .
neutral	they do put expected wait on the website but this is sometimes just plain wrong or you can miss it quite easily .
negative	i arrived at gatwick and went to the avis_desk …. and from then on it ’_s been a nightmare .
neutral	i have ordered several_times and always been very pleased .
negative	i ordered a kartell componibili storage_unit from this ' designer living specialist '.
positive	thank_you
negative	dear_sir / madam ,
negative	refund was paid on jan 00nd , email_informing_me of this was promptly followed_by another email_stating that groupon had not received the item yet and had i decided to keep it !
negative	my argument is if you don_'_t have it in stock then don_'_t allow me to buy it !
positive	bike was received by tnt very quickly and i cannot_fault anything .
neutral	hat on the large side so will have to alter it .
neutral	delivery time was said to be on the thursday of that week which would have been great fix the car weekend , wrong part did not arrive_till monday_afternoon also it was not complete what i had ordered .
neutral	0 very good
neutral	went to the taxi office who said they had to have instruction from the hotel which they had not received , so the gentleman very kindly rang the hotel .
neutral	these negatives aside i would still recommend them as the product quality and service is very good and returns are easy .
positive	excellent service , very good website and competitive_prices .
positive	i know they will be delivered on time and i am kept_informed of all_aspects of delivery .
negative	00 : 00 where are you with my car !
positive	i was lucky that the 00 . 00 mother '_s day bouquet had been reduced to 00 . 00 and opted for delivery on the friday .
positive	very pleased with the entire service :-)
negative	during a six week period from 00th_september to date this has not changed and has_been advertised online by ofo and still is as 00 days .
negative	i then came on here & read the horror_stories so immediately opened a dispute with paypal .
positive	very easy to do had payment within 0_weeks good communication
neutral	upon purchasing my products i made it very clear , on more than one occasion , that i did not want the 0 year care plan .
negative	my recent delivery did not turn_up , no phone_call from asda , nothing !
negative	my advice is avoid this web_site ( and the other one she runs from the same address !)
neutral	disagreed with underwriting decision , extra premium for trivial , inactive medical_condition .
negative	they would not let us leave with out paying £_000 and told us we would have internet with 0_weeks after 00 weeks and being on the phone everyday we tried to cancel it
neutral	0 .
positive	the quality of the product is excellent and the service received was excellent .
neutral	the envelopes arrived today in good nick but i received an e_- mail on thursday to say they were being dispatched on friday .
neutral	went for prince of cambridge as my choice so now wishing i ' d picked something else !
neutral	i have a kitten , so i couldnt take part in the offer .
neutral	og_vi_har aldrig været ude for ikke at få_en ordentlig faktura med_en forsendelse .
neutral	the villa could have been cleaner and broken bits replaced as the company ask fo r a hefty ' breakage ' amount of money .
negative	they spoke to the owner while i was on the phone with them and advised that i should find alternativa accommodation in the middle of the night and with a pregnant wife !
neutral	ease of on - line ordering and price highly competative .
positive	recommended .
positive	shame they can '_t supply some sun !
negative	i was given three dates for delivery and on each date it didn_'_t show up with no warning beforehand that it wasn_'_t coming !
neutral	all the necessary amenities are there including bars , restaurants , butchers , bakery and a few shops .
neutral	i like that you can give an honest review and it helps with choosing locations and hotels etc .
positive	thanks for your help
negative	promised return phone_calls , which have never happened .
neutral	there are also a lot of search_filters , which are helpful .
negative	only ordered from this company once and will be the last time .

positive	try animed on line will deffo use them again !
negative	if i lived_closer id be down there collecting it in person !
positive	very pleased with the item i ordered .
positive	she seems pleased with it .
neutral	it was 000 $ when i bought my item but credit_card was charged for 000 .
neutral	however , whilst i like it i am really not sure about the quality .
negative	i became very upset as £ 0000 is a lot of money to spend .
negative	i inquired_about some sort of compensation but was eventually told that they would give me 00_% of the extra it would cost if i chose one of their options .
neutral	shame you have to dispose of the packaging yourself .
negative	i woyuld not recommend this company it does not carry out deliveries on time .
negative	in light of this i contacted " groupon " to be told that i had misread the fine print and because it was longer_than seven_days after i purchased the voucher i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund and they could only give me credits .
neutral	ordered a double grill_element , arrived quickly , part was correct , however , the packaging left a lot to be desired .
negative	i find this completely_unacceptable and certainly not unbiased as they should be .
neutral	whilst the system works . there is no collection service and it is very slow compared to other_sites .
neutral	0 out of 00
negative	and just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady , i was actually getting things together pretty fast .
positive	i received the keys i ordered from you yesterday_afternoon today - they all work fine thanks !
negative	so i sit .
neutral	i bought a dress and when it arrived it didn_'_t suit me so i package it up as asked with all the correct labels supplied , took it to the post_office and received proof of postage etc .
positive	didnt_expect that at all absoloutley love them !
positive	the website is really easy to use .
positive	it was one of our best trips ever .
positive	i chose you because your flowers looked lovely and by selecting a no delivery charge offer i got more flowers for my money and upgraded to the medium from standard .
positive	simple to order samples , good value for money with good quality materials , easy ordering system with good customer_care .
negative	p . s .
positive	this was a no - nonsence purchase from a seller who can deliver a deal with no_fuss .
positive	packaging very practical and all plants arrived in excellent condition .
positive	the answer came back quickly and it was just what i wanted .
positive	very good service and hassle_free .
positive	also a solid_oak corner_unit for the tv which fits_perfectly and looks_stunning .
negative	however , we then received an email_saying that we now owed a further £_000 . 00 .
negative	they never collected and , sure_enough the agent went home .
positive	i would definitely recommend them .
positive	!
positive	my guess is they may well be made overseas anyway but some link to the uk is good .
negative	completely unnecessary company that adds stress to an already tough time when moving , would not recommend .
positive	after ordering polybags the delivery days were 0 - 0 working_days .
positive	efficient friendly service , item just as advertised , at a very good price .
neutral	we contacted the seller and they made yodel come_back to collect the rubbish .
negative	after four telephone_calls , the ( first of which i was extremely apologetic for my error ) and two emails when i have repeatedly given the corrected readings , instead of sorting this problem they have written to me saying they are going to quadruple my monthly direct_debit to ' bring my account back on track ' as my dd is not covering my usage .
positive	fantastic range of products , delivered next_day , at very competitive_prices .
positive	these memory_foam mattresses are very comfortable and shape thereselves around your body .
negative	first time ive bought blind from online and am bitterly_disappointed at the substandard quality of the roman_blind i received .
negative	.
positive	oh but a word of warning , don_'_t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
negative	this is madness as i used a decent stanley tape_measure to take the box sizes and rounded them up before booking the parcel , ditto the same with the weight before i looked for a courier .
negative	when we got there the queue for the car_hire was horrendous .
negative	i was charged 000 for a 0 nights_stay !!!
negative	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
positive	fast website with choice of local_fitters .
positive	i placed my order and received it 0 days_later .
neutral	the manager of the shop i didnt think he was very friendly .
neutral	i bought this product as a birthday_present and the quality is good .
positive	thank_you !
neutral	the items were delivered quicker_than_expected and the delivery service itself was commendable but i felt that the whole_experience was marred_by the issue in the store .
positive	but more_importantly because of the service i received .
neutral	good website , good prices .
neutral	i asked to speak with the manager , who did phone me back , explained that the inverness branch got deliveraries on thursdays , she offered me tyres which were in stock , but had a balance of £_00 so she said as a good will gesture i would just have £_00 to pay , i was happy with that as i was getting better tyres_fitted in the end .
neutral	nevermind :-)
neutral	which was booked in for a month from delivery , i would have thought a company like dfs would follow_up minor problems like this far quicker_than a month
negative	booked a hotel now .
neutral	cats had a good go at their new cheap food and they ' re normally quite fussy !
negative	i have therefore made my own objections to the manner in which this chap continues to have the factual feedback left by many about his company removed for no reason .
negative	made a phone_call to tyre_shopper only to be informed the problem is down to bridgestone .
negative	awful service , rip_off thieves , unhelpful customer_services dept .
positive	awesome :) i will_definitely be using teleflorist again .
negative	called again and was told that it was at the hub just waiting to be delivered but the depot had removed the 0st_nov delivery date for some reason and left it blank .
neutral	this is a helpful website and offers good information and good prices .
neutral	i initially had trouble logging - in .
neutral	purchased an odessey premier flute which was advertised as ex_display and was valued at a fair price .
positive	brilliant prices , next_day deliver .
negative	i had been without a signal at home for over three_weeks .
neutral	although the dialogue with photoworld was very good they could not give reasons for the apparent graining i found on many of the photos in the book - most photos were approx 0mb in size although some were smaller - i '_m not convinced the full size of the files were uploaded as each picture seemed to upload in seconds with an upload speed of approx 000kb .
positive	thanks iflorist - you saved the day and made someone very happy too !
negative	i was told that i cannot get my deposit back so i stuck to it but i really am not happy with all experience .
positive	superb price too .
positive	the mattress was inspected and photographed within 0_days !
neutral	flowers were lovely though and i can not fault the service or communication .
neutral	!
positive	0_stars !
negative	ordered an item on the 00rd_jan , on a three day delivery , told it was instock , did a track on this item on 00th_jan only to find that the delivery date was now up to the 00 feb . no email from littlewoods informing_me of this delay or why .

negative	i got a knock on my door same week having problems with sp from a new energy_supplier economy energy not on comparison_sites because they are guaranteed 00_% cheaper_than all the big 0 rip_offs !
positive	love it !
positive	booked the car in for two new tires on the day that suited me best , took it there and was gone again within half an_hour , very pleased !
positive	i was extremely impressed with merlin .
negative	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???

neutral	hope you can sort it out thanks
negative	told us there was lots of parking at the apartment only to arrive and find none and had to park 0 cars at £_00 a night plus £ 0 per day so for each car cost £_00 to park for the weekend .
neutral	you have redeemed yourselves .
positive	yes you might get a set of mats cheaper but i '_ve been there before .
negative	this company sucks - as most of the reviews on here imply .
positive	maxima mobile wa great .
negative	oh i never recived any confirmation_email as others have written in their reviews .
neutral	i couldn_'_t_believe that when we sat down to arrange a delivery we were told that the furniture may split as it acclimatises to this country and being in a home because the wood is from abroad !
positive	cheers_guys !
neutral	i had to wait_until new stock was received and then it was send to the uk via_dhl who had the wrong_postcode entered on their tracking site .
positive	i like the service in transglobal_express
negative	not 00 - but 00 .
neutral	good site and airline servicing europe , parts of the middle_east and north africa .
neutral	this meant that the plant spent about 0_days in the post_office sorting depot , having lost most of the compost around the roots , before i was able to pick it up .
negative	a truly , truly desperate service !
neutral	however , i will order from rajapack again as their products are great and i will assume that this delivery mishap was just a one off .
positive	affordable mobile solutions
positive	altogether a very friendly and professional service .
neutral	good size and manufacture but the wheels make a terrible noise when being pulled along a pavement
neutral	and delivery trouble free .
positive	i lost my phone after i had placed my order so mazuma gave_me an_extension and were very helpful on email .
neutral	as mobility impaired would have preferred an airport pick_up .
neutral	would i use again , quite possibly not which is a pity given what i saw on the website .
neutral	and the resort was stunning and clean .
neutral	trustpilot should accept this and in some ways take some accolades for it , as they have helped true retailers raise the game but to punish the retailer with a reduction in score for being good is stupid .
neutral	when i came back all the work i ' d done was lost , to my utter fury .

negative	the flowers i ordered were for a special birthday .
negative	( my son , heard this and offered me his , which was my old s0 ).
negative	only 0 arrived .
negative	it was so bad that no thought was given to signing for the goods .
neutral	saves being stung for whole rental charge again for extra insurance .
neutral	the travelex service in general was good .
positive	i placed the order midweek and was given an estimated_date for delivery which made it easy for me to schedule being available or having the parcel left with a neighbor .
negative	i called their telephone customer service today to help find an item but received horrible customer service !!
negative	only by checking the website re status of delivery did i find the order had been stopped due to out of stock and they never even bothered to inform_me .
neutral	eventually they authorised the taxi and we got back for our car .
neutral	very prompt delivery following ordering after_reading good reviews online .
positive	back in action kept me up to date via_e_- mail on the progress of my order and it was delivered very quickly .
negative	we were also expecting another parcel from a different supplier , which city_link again failed to deliver , although claim that their driver had delivered it and had it signed for .

negative	from_start to finish duel were a nightmare .
negative	in the mean time i have paid and am without the items .
positive	the time frame we work in can be over a very extended period …… in january , we had to use a message from feb_0000 !
negative	i have saved several screen_shots of what i believe to be false_advertising and misleading and seemingly for no reason , in a recent response from them they have acknowledged they have their it team updating the listings , which to me suggests they acknowledge my claims .
negative	after paying £_00 for two_bunches of flowers to recieve one bunch of poxy looking tulips is a complete_rip_off .
negative	so i rang them to request a replacement or refund and was dismissed out of hand by the guy i spoke to because " the packaging had been opened ".
positive	i was kept_fully_informed of the progression of my order and the recipient was delighted with her bouquet .
negative	always promised to get back , but never did .
positive	and received the money in my bank_account 00_hrs later after sending the phone .

neutral	i was less_than impressed when i found out she didn_'_t know who they were from after paying 0 . 00 for a card .
neutral	as stated above so_far so good but as everything is fresh its hard to make any kind of critique .
negative	the point is if they had told me the sheds would take more than a month to come i would have still ordered them but the terrible lack of information and failure to contact me back and rudeness on the phone is what made me cancell the order .
negative	after all that bending over_backwards they then tell you it '_s not faulty !!
positive	on receipt , i realized i had requested the wrong one !
positive	many_thanks .
neutral	not good enough !
neutral	thankfully no mention of bramble '_s imminent_arrival was forcast but i know for sure that had she arrived squeals of delight would have be heard for many miles .
neutral	the show was fantastic with great seats , but the travelodge in southwark was such a let_down !

negative	i '_ve_used myprotein for a few_years_now and , whilst the products are fine , they are becoming less competitive by price and their customer service is going down the pan .
positive	all items were of good quality , one issue with belt_buckle but was quickly resolved .
neutral	i really enjoy using pet_supermarket , i find that there website is easy to use and that there products are of a good quality and also competitevly priced .

negative	why would anyone sell a product without making_sure all the relevant pieces are enclosed and available .
positive	!
negative	problem_solved you might think , not so .
neutral	ordering system ok , phone contact and delivery information very poor .
neutral	bedding is good quality from bedeck not a problem with any of the items we bought .

neutral	you have to activate the sim , then call us and we '_ll see what we want to put on it .

neutral	when changing the hinges so door opened the other way it was found the the moulding that the bottom hinge was screwed to was distorted that side .
negative	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it '_s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .
neutral	no issues with customer communications and delivery but incredibly disappointed at the volume of flowers included in the package , given the price .
positive	inspite of one of my tapes being of bad quality , they were able to transfer my footage .

negative	0 times i booked with you and twice i had problems .
negative	the customer service response was abrupt and did not offer to rectify the situation .
positive	i would however like to suggest that the site contains an option where the buyer could be contacted by text or email to inform when the flowers have arrived to the recipient .
neutral	however i have felt their wrath a couple of times when i filled in the description of items being sent as car parts which is what they were .
negative	i understand that it was christmas however not satisfactory
neutral	there were footmarks over the items , shower_screen packaging which i presume was caused_by the delivery driver at dx frieght .
positive	i trawled the net for ages looking for the right shower_door , drip strip , then at last i found it . showerseal came up with the goods and now our bathroom_floor is dry at last !

positive	i wish everyone paid out so quickly !!!
negative	be warned they are trading on amazon and not shipping out items but taking the money !
positive	very impressed as always , have sold devices before and mazuma is the only provider that can carryout the promise of easy postage and prompt payment .
negative	i suggest you only consider them if you are absolutely desperate to sell quickly and be prepared to receive an actual offer which has no_resemblance at all to the one they initially gave you .
positive	overall i would highly_recommend blood sweat & ink tattoos .
positive	would recommend to anyone , a very quick , convenient and simple process .
negative	after many attempts , one high ranking officials replied me , she said , amazon can not refund me , they will refund the money to the original owner of the voucher , i asked them , i got salary from my boss , if m & s refunds me and tell me , they will refund my boss because he paid me , is this funny , then amazon keep silence .
positive	with high demands for sneakers i want , urban_industry makes it easier for me to get what i want and less hassle .
neutral	cheaper tickets often available at or near venues , especially in london .
negative	will not be buying from this company again or recommending it to others .
neutral	website said goods ordered before early_afternoon normally shipped same day .
positive	i got shoes within_00hrs after purchase on - line - excellent - without even have to pay for postage - it was free with item i bought .
neutral	for some reviews this is really obvious and distracting , especially compared to other gaming review sites ( but this practice of companies pushing for good reviews doesn_'_t just fall onto ign , don_'_t get me wrong ).
negative	my advice : be careful of people selling acoustic foam , and see it in person before buying .
positive	i had emails giving me regular_updates on my order .
neutral	have ordered a couple of times in the last month and both_times took 0 - 0 days to receive goods , certainly not as quick as crc and planet x , 0 days for them .

neutral	its now monday_night and still not received the rest of my order .
neutral	product comes on time , but even_though it has_been packed well , the cans have come through damaged and dented .
negative	they told me i could only have a voucher worth the item i returned however i didn_'_t like another item in your store .
positive	had exactly_what i wanted and even more of what i desired !
negative	i think that this is outragious - they have taken £_00 of my friends money and i have been robbed of an opportunity to purchase the 00th_birthday_present she intended me to have - shame on you cath_kidston !
negative	it '_s just not worth the couple of euros you '_ll save
negative	so it was up to me to make a return trip and lose a full day of my holiday .
positive	would definitely use them again .
neutral	very convenient that the online service meant i did not have to travel to an optician to do any of this .
neutral	they promised to let_me know when the item is in stock but informed me my glasses are on their way only after i sent them another message enquiring_about my order .
neutral	also i was not expecting the jigsaw finish to be shinny .
positive	very friendly , quick service .
negative	they are judge and jury , and in this instance have cost me a customer '_s future order and tarnished my online reputation .
neutral	having used other photo_book sites i found this one quite easy to use .
neutral	i placed the order only to find out 00_hours_later that one unit was actually out of stock and wouldn_'_t be available for at_least 0 week .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it is possible but it should also allow the direct exchange between existing users , i think this would increase confidence and use . other than this excellent and highly_recommended .
negative	tried febreeze , but the odour must have been ingrained in the material .
neutral	instead you have to post the prescription to them and wait for as long as it takes for the prescription to arrive before they send out the medication .
negative	placed an order for christmas_lights on 0th_december .
neutral	has this not been the case my review would probably be 0_star , but this was a real inconvenience and , had i not checked in_advance , could have ruined the whole outfit .

neutral	i still order from them , i '_m just not too surprised if they cancel the order .
negative	would recommend
positive	thought i would look at cg on line and got it cheap and quick
positive	so_far on all my orders since using viovet , the company is always slightly_cheaper , when the free delivery is taken into account .
positive	the order arrived the very next_day , enabling_me to deliver the finished products to my client a day ahead of schedule , guaranteeing return orders for both myself and the chocolate_trading co .
negative	after that no attempt was made to inform_me .
negative	i send the phone and tehy no paid is working and i check , its was something with insurance , i dont care about that is working i paid for that phone 000 pouds

positive	after trying for months to get an anna dress hooray i got one from here !!
negative	add to that the fact i get no response from the system administrators despite_numerous_emails & messages via facebook , it makes me want to leave the site altogether and use twitter instead as they seem to have more of an understanding of how to deal with their users on a one - to - one basis rather_than being a faceless entity .
positive	one phone_call to really pleasant , helpful guy sorted the issue and we were able to order on line .
negative	is this how we deal with customers in 0000 ?
neutral	was really looking to make friends and see where it went .

negative	after 0 months i still have a useless tap and no money back .
neutral	not a bad service though and offered highest price on the internet .

positive	all in all i had a great experience and had my car within around 0_weeks from the initial_contact with nick .
negative	so i reported it via_e_- mail and 0_days_later it was still not fixed .
negative	disgusting lack of customer_care .
negative	reluctantly she looked across at a dour looking female in another queue who nodded and replied " yes that '_s right we don_'_t refund on the one receipt ".
negative	absolutely_shocking service thereafter !
neutral	otherwise all ok . driver also said didn_'_t have time for me to check all tiles ok which would have been nice as still had to sign for them !
neutral	i will put another review on when
neutral	i have two main things to complain_about .
neutral	i '_ve been waiting 00 days so far .
positive	i would highly_recommend these_guys .
negative	i am still out of pocket by £_000 and both mastercard and paypal are now involved .
negative	and when the reject they can '_t even recommend a service that can .
positive	i didn_'_t realise how easy it was to sell my phone and get the money so quickly and the phone wasn_'_t even working i did it all online with mazuma_mobile , i even made the mistake of clicking on the wrong button so i would of been laud by cheque but mazuma_mobile called me to check and it was paid into my bank that afternoon .
negative	it took 0 months to get a refund on that order .
neutral	i shopped with them for years , putting up with the awful staff until i found the same products with other people at half the price
positive	i went for the free delivery option , so i was not expecting it all that quickly , however it arrived in good time and very well_packaged .
negative	!
positive	i usually hand my phones on to my parents or bin them , so thought i would see if it was with selling this time .
negative	does cpw have the legal right to prove faults on a phone did not exist from point of sales because the customer did not ring every day to report the problem with in the first 00 days ?
neutral	next time i '_ll just use an atm i think .
neutral	one criticism is that the villa is quite remote from the town and although a pleasant walk to town the return trip with pushchairs and shopping is a hard uphill walk which will not suit anyone with mobility_issues .
positive	i will use them again !
negative	companies should not have the right to pass peoples details to debt_collectors due to their mistake - especially when you spend sooo_much of your time contacting them to get it rectified .
neutral	i now have the complete order ( but overall it was a bit of a headache and can '_t say i '_ll be in any great hurry to order anything_else .
positive	i '_ll definitely be shopping with bananafingers again .
negative	staff tell me that are in contact with driver , he is aware that its to be with me that day asap to hit 0pm_deadline ( for a secret_santa ).
positive	however . my mind was put at ease instantly , with great communication , great prices and super_fast shipment .

neutral	i have to say that i would ' nt use this airpark again .
neutral	i have used_serenta_flowers several_times before , but this time i was let_down .
positive	great service and very quick .
positive	bought a second pair as the price was too tempting to miss and good to have another pair for when the other one is in the wash . order was despatched very promptly by merlin_cycles and delivered next_day by royal_mail .
negative	all of them said they ' d get someone to call me back . no one ever did .
negative	i am leaving sky because of terrible broadband that they cannot sort_out but excellent !!!
neutral	in the end as a gesture of " goodwill " they gave_me £_00 , do you know how much food you can buy for £_00 these days ?
negative	i will instead take my custom elsewhere and am very dissatisfied with the service .
negative	my biggest gripe is when a company fails to honour groupon don_'_t want to know .
neutral	i took my car from dubrovnik were i waited for about 00 - 00_minutes to get my car .
neutral	the scratching_post was in perfect_condition and packed very well , the food however . awful !!
neutral	good product and website very easy to use .
neutral	all in all not bad but could have been better .
positive	after discussing my requirements with sales_dept and going through the likely print quantities i was recommended the lexmark c000de .
neutral	not the experience of meet and greet i have had before when car was taken and returned .
negative	still , a pretty horrendous few_months with little help from the customer service team .
negative	any guesses as to how long my credit_card refund will take ?
positive	was looking for a keyboard , realized i needed to do some homework , and this site was extremely_helpful in assisting with the decision .
negative	i agreed to this .
positive	two batteries are even better , especially when they recharge in only an_hour .
negative	to add_insult to injury chess have ignored my cancellation and have continued to send bills .
positive	they far_exceeded my expectations and i would not_hesitate to use again or to recommend .
neutral	vi skal_bruge en faktura med pris_og antal på for at få pengene refunderet .
negative	ocado cancelled my delivery just saying my payment details cannot be verified .
positive	todo sin problemas , pagina segura y de confianza .
negative	i wont_be ordering from you again .
negative	sorry but i cannot recommend this company , i feel very let_down , after recommendation , which was an important time in our family .
neutral	i had some problems and i didn_'_t like how they managed to solve them . but next time i '_ll keep more attention .
negative	if this is an example of what scotland has to offer , good luck to them and the potential independence !!
positive	you can search for most products but need to make_sure you couldnt purchase the same items or service at a lower price outside of quidco
positive	it was easy to select the right tyre after simply entering my reg .
negative	how can we , the customer , convince the selling companies to stop using them .
negative	will never use this company again , nor will my niece or her friends after this .
positive	their service is excellent , next_day delivery , & you also know when it '_s arriving .
positive	what more could you ask for ?
positive	a good idea .
neutral	but looking at the photo of the flower being delivered , it was beautiful !
negative	0km '_s , he also drove over a couple of speed - bumps much too quickly , as a subsequence my wife banged her_face ( had a nice bruised nose as a memento ), my son banged his head !
positive	thank_you hfe for your prompt and professional service and especially to beth .
negative	shocking overall experience and left out of pocket into the bargain .
neutral	this means that the gift box is warped and creased down one side which i '_m_sure my dad won_'_t really care about ( father '_s day gift ) but i '_m quite disappointed .
positive	usb0u provided a great service , from_start to finish .
neutral	the price was good and more i have used the site the more exspencive it is getting so look out for offers also the more you book they sent money off vouchers make shore you look out where to put the code as i missed it and missed out till next booking on discount .
negative	common_sense says call a customer if something is not in stock and see what they want to do about it , chemist_direct instead dispatch what they can and then tell you the rest is now out of stock !
neutral	it was a more complaicated order as i was paying from overseas but they made no effort to try and find a solution .
neutral	would use again .
negative	judging_by the reviews i can expect to receive a terrible service .
negative	gone to argos got myself a payg_sim done a £_00 . 00 top up and called orange to transfer my number .
negative	since i had payed £_00 in taxes and also £ 0 , 00 in postage to get the dress i wondered_if they would cover this to for me , otherwise i would have payed £_00 , 00 for nothing .
neutral	flowers were nice and delivered in time , the only problem is that the greeting_card was missing so they had no idea who had sent them !
neutral	ordering was easy , the items came quickly and overall we were pleased with the outfits .
neutral	customer service was average at best , taking 0 days to reply to an email requesting a change of order .
negative	ordered a mother '_s day gift ( flowers ) to be delivered on mother '_s day , stil hasn_'_t arrived , unable to contact anyone from iflorist , online_chat is always offline , 00 + calls to their customer service line weren_'_t answered , and no response on their " support " system .
negative	you do realise ther is a recession on you a hole , you might not care if you go_bust , but i cant_afford to piss my customers off .
positive	the sign was dispatched exactly as promised and i am very pleased with the whole_experience
negative	it did have the freesia '_s and roses , but the basket was also meant to contain orchids and there were none .
neutral	hard to log on and look at your stuff , improve your website orange !
positive	if you want all your building supplies from one place try beatsons , good friendly service .
positive	on the plus_side , it seems that loans have more security than other p0p sites .
neutral	in conclusion , regus are a cowboy_outfit .
positive	there are various delivery options but the standard delivery was quick enough for me .
positive	had been looking for this specific hat , and not many places were selling it - light , comfortable , folds & compact .
positive	i had been looking for nikwax cotton proof in the shops for a while - and i work in central_london , near all the outdoor_sports shops - but to no_avail .
neutral	this was only ok .
negative	if not its fraud if i do not get my money back !
negative	i called to inform them and was asked " could i make use of them ?"

negative	yet another disgraceful scenario .
neutral	most transactions go through with no_problems but i have had 0 experiences where the clicks have failed and no matter_how much you try and have it out with customer_support , and back it up with times and dates , they just refuse to pay out .
positive	great price for the tapered photo crystal .
negative	choose genuine battery for your kit , a bit more_expensive but you get a quality product and some ' real ' warranty .
negative	i rang up to see where it was only to be told that the delivery driver had delivered it to the wrong_address .
positive	quickly delivered too .
negative	the shirt has_been made using the minimum of material , ie the shirt tails are short as are the sleeves .
neutral	my overall experience was that the service was good , the sales_executive was friendly not too pushy and made the purchase of a our qashqai run very smoothly .
negative	not acceptable .
neutral	the service was absolutely unbelievable - my order arrived the very next_day , despite problems i had paying online .
negative	i have tried again as they have stuff i want .
negative	no phone number which is very convenient for them , although i guess you would never get through with the number of complaints they must receive .
positive	they email you when they receive your phone and keep you in the loop with the progress of your order .
positive	had a few things done here now and the service is always fast and friendly .
positive	communication excellent - advised that two of my items ordered were delivered to them damaged .
neutral	the service in the blackpool store is not as good as preston - st georges as you are kept waiting for longer asthey never seem to have enough people on and the unit feels cramped .

negative	for six of the seven trades they said they would arrange transport from my home due to the tare level .
positive	i have only ever had a couple of issues and on each_occasion it was dealt_with swiftly and professionally by customer_services , with replacement parts sent .

negative	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
neutral	good place to shop
neutral	the product i purchased was satisfactory although there was no receipt of actual amount paid inside which i found strange

negative	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
neutral	so i needed some new ram , google found memory . co . uk / com .
neutral	however when the book came it was great and she loved it .
positive	i would definitely use it again and give full recommendation to others .

positive	response and delivery time was so fast great company
positive	i must mention sammy in customer_services who was truly superb in helping_me through this and the result is more than 000_% satisfactory .
neutral	there '_s no excuse when your running a business !
negative	given that we had already waited 00 days we couldn_'_t understand_why this was necessary but reluctantly had to go along with it .
positive	i was sceptical .
negative	i went to a nut and bolt manufacturer as well as a plumb centre and they advised that the fitting from the body of the tap and the connecting nut was not a recognised plumbing fitting and advised that he got a lot of ' mugs ' like me that had bought cheap from the internet .
negative	they claim all_sorts of excuses but fail to realise that all the delivery locations i have specified have cctv so can easily prove that they are lying .
neutral	but my friend says try you s so i did and never arrived when i wanted it there
positive	it was simple to arrange , cost_effective and they did what they said they would do .
neutral	at this point i asked for my order to be cancelled and money to be refunded as i was disappointed that payment had been processed at the time of the order and ten days_later i had still not received my items .
positive	xxxxxxxxxxxxx
neutral	( even_though they are in the stated dimensions ) and weight
neutral	i think they should offer more swagbucks for everything you do .
positive	this was in no way the fault of complete_care shop .
neutral	we even asked the salesman , who it turns_out was the assistant_manager whether it was solid or not .
neutral	the recent change to the format for placing items for sale has complicated things - should have been left as it was
negative	fine till they lose a parcel .
positive	however none really suited my needs .
neutral	i am not happy that insurance always offered in such a way , that you are made to believe wax_polish is free .
negative	the flight was changed to one day earlier - but they didnt feel the need to give us this information .
positive	being_able to watch a short video of the function of each oven was great .
neutral	the problem starts with support : emails taking days to be replied to ( if at all ) and not all emails being read .
positive	items are sent out very quickly and well_packaged but what makes this company really stand out is the outstanding customer_support .
negative	every time !
negative	there was a pending payment to homebase on my bank_account for this amount so i rang homebase to find out what is going on - turns_out they have no trace of my order !!

neutral	there is a nice little seating_area by the river but this too was colonised by smokers so not pleasant for non - smokers .
neutral	however , the case was not the case advertised being a cheaper alternative ( not good ).
negative	i use mail order a lot and it has_been a number of years since i encountered such intransigence .
positive	i dont realy look on other clothing sites anymore just beacuse urban_industry has better discounts on what i want and it has most of what im looking for .

negative	told by sam not to relabel as citylink would do it .
negative	they have never managed to resolve any problem , just made it that complicated and time_consuming i '_ve ended_up working through it and doing it myself , rather_than reading what may as well be automated_replies solving nothing
positive	always courteous , always informative , always helpful and always prompt in their response .
neutral	this was around 00 : 00hrs .
positive	brilliant service .

negative	after an unanswered email and another lengthy conversation by phone i was told they hadn_'_t had them back as nothing had been logged .
positive	really impressed with easy website and efficient service with delivery from drumstop .
negative	trying to get hold of anyone at this company is a nightmare , they don_'_t answer the phone , they don_'_t return voicemails , their online_chat is always offline , they take an age to answer emails if at all !

neutral	their isa pays less_than my savings account .
positive	we spent four days at ferndale house .
positive	staff were courteous , helpful and friendly .
neutral	they told me the item i ordered was out of stock after one week .
neutral	this seems crazy to me and surely someone somewhere in hn could review this concern .
negative	he recieved an_email on wednesday 00th at 00 . 00pm to say they wouldnt be delivered until 00th !!!!!
negative	this is without even mentioning the possibility that they won_'_t even turn_up and will subcontract your job instead , as in my case .

neutral	not easy to clearly see what the cover is .
positive	great delivery and great service .

neutral	all cakes were squashed and spoiled .
positive	amazed when i checked what others had paid , as we paid in one instance £_000 less for exactly the same holiday and no one we spoke to had paid as little as we did , so 00 out of 00 for price .
negative	0_weeks in and no delivery so we contacted them , not easy , e_mails unusually ignored and the telephone rings out constantly , but if your have a few hours to kill it gets answered .
neutral	but the follow_up and delivery system were poor - paid for and was confirmed next_day delivery but nothing arrived and when i rang it worked out that the delivery wasn_'_t even programmed .
neutral	the case is great for carrying it around and the product perfect for what we use it for ( exhibitions and smaller scale events ).
negative	they completely went to waste and i wasted a lot of money .
neutral	i used kitbag a number of times now and generally the service has_been excellent however for a recent order for which there was a significant delay , there was little in way of customer service communication or am apology when the revised order fulfilment date wasn_'_t met .
negative	will never order online again . i am gutted , have lost money i have worked hard for all year .:(
negative	they have had since 00th_march , it '_s now 0th_april .
negative	they underestimated the length of the job by 0_days ( a 0 day job in total ) because they ( in their own words ) " underestimated how long the paint would take to dry ".
positive	be daft not to !
negative	new review
negative	i place my order on friday for delivery on saturday .
positive	i returned one pair as i ordered 0 so that i could choose and posted the unwanted pair back the following_day .
negative	recently booked an flight through travelsupermarket --> crystal_travel .
neutral	i thought the instructions re the layout of photos on mug could have been made simpler .
positive	the process was superb .
neutral	vendors have to edge on the cautious side when giving delivery estimates but these days rarely do you have to wait more than a few_days and especially for goods that are in stock !
neutral	the package arrived alot quicker_than expect .
positive	reciever was really pleased with the flowers .
positive	this went_smoothly with the yodel van turning_up on the correct day and the driver being very helpful , telling_me about how long it would take for my package to be returned to amazon .
negative	they were faster in 0000 .
positive	i feel that they were very informative and direct about the selling procedure .
neutral	i used to use easyjet alot when their prices were good and you could get the prices they advertised , not so much now .
negative	searching for answers to real problems results in no practical_advice of substance .
negative	after_posting my review i received the reply shown below from yodel which states that my parcel is out for delivery !
positive	good work .
negative	confirmation was received saying seranta had successfully delivered the flowers to my home . sadly yet again this was false and no flowers had actually been delivered . i am beginning to take this personally !!!
neutral	makes them not worth the saving .
negative	beware .
neutral	i was initially pleased with the service provided .
negative	palmed off with , voice coils not covered_under_warranty , no mention of this anywhere , underpowered provided amplifier cause of clipping and coil burn , kit never fit for purpose .
negative	the delivery guy refused liability .
neutral	the update button is on the other side of the page as well so it is not clear that this related to the action of changing the required qty .
neutral	after i sent them an enquiry i found out that due to a " mistake " my sunglasses were out of stock and delivery will be delayed .
positive	bookmark the site
positive	i am very impressed with this company their website was easy and friendly for me to use , the prices were very good and the service second to none .

positive	the items were delivered quickly and without breakages .
negative	i spent an_hour there .
neutral	i was sent the wrong item by chemistdirect which is frustrating .
negative	we heard_nothing for weeks and had to call them back .
negative	ordered a inflatable mario kart at christmas and have still to receive suitable correspondence via_email . and dont even bother trying to ring as your call wont_be answered . avoid !
positive	the on - line shop was informative and easy to use , the availability of stock was good and the service was efficient .
negative	i would not have kept it even if it did .
neutral	delivery etc was all good .
neutral	i have been with o0 since they were cellnet .
positive	great communication and very quick payment .
neutral	00 days_later it arrived into stock .
negative	true to form city_link didn_'_t turn_up on the 00th but did on the 00st_december_0000 .
neutral	communication problems between companies need to improve , my room was booked nearly 0_weeks before .
negative	i ordered a groupon with this company , the code didn_'_t work on their site .
neutral	everyone does it still so who_cares
neutral	very impressive and rare , free sample service was quick and efficient but because of the inflexibility and poor customer service from the courier ( team c aka rdm aka express logistics !)
negative	possibly the worst customer service on the internet .
positive	as arnie_said " i will be back "
negative	when i said i was not paying that and wanted a refund i was told i would still be charged_£_00 !
negative	there is no way that you can contact anyone to do this .
positive	my wife_loved them and it was so easy
neutral	appriciate that delivery costs are including but £_00 . 00 is poor value for what was delivered .
negative	wished i spent £_00 . 00 in sainsburys as i would have had a more striking and value for money bouquet .
neutral	received my order the following_day which was excellent i am a little_worried that the bow_tie is a bit small it is his_birthday this sunday so he wil see it and i will know if the size is right if not can i return the tie and get a larger one .
positive	great service
positive	free delivery within 0 days at a given time with regular email_updates
negative	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
negative	ordered tickets in februaruy to see pink in hannover on the 0th_may .
positive	the costume was fantastic , children did not run away as with previous costumes but ran up for cuddles and handshakes .
negative	i have purchased from china before and i do always expect a long shipping time , from purchase to receiving my item was over two_weeks ( in business days ) this was fine but it is slightly_annoying that the company make promises they do not fulfil .
negative	for this reason i was prepared to wait more than the 0 - 00 working_days they state at the time of ordering .
negative	even_though i am covered i bet again i don_'_t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member . if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
negative	refund tx code : reffurniturein0000000000000000000 - f00
neutral	if you want a goods night sleep don_'_t stop in room 00 ( think it was that number ).
positive	i ordered keys for a bisley cabinet and a kinnarps set of drawers during the weekend , which arrived by tuesday .
positive	best price and service for hills_prescription cat_food .
positive	so easy .
negative	other times just throw over fence .
neutral	normally i would send back and exchange but i desperately need the clippers for work so do not have the choice to swap as not enough time .
positive	brilliant service , will recomend to everyone
positive	order arrived quickly .
negative	i call citylink as on the site all it has his " package mis sorted ".
positive	will be using cyclestore again because i found the whole buying experience very good . even when they didn_'_t have the item i wanted , they quickly contacted me , suggested an_alternative , or swift refund , no_problems found them very helpful and reliable .
positive	delivery was fast and well_packaged , would use this site again .
neutral	wonder_how many folk dont notice the colour choice and simply give up like we did 0st time round ?
negative	was informed there had been a problem with the delivery van , but that they would be delivered today , and was given a £ 0 voucher_code as an_apology .
neutral	i have since purchased memory from another_provider and they have worked_fine no troubles at all .
neutral	regards g bagshaw
positive	easy sorting delivery , not to mention convienient picking your own day .
negative	!
negative	re - scheduled for tuesday and waited in all day and ditto no - one came .
neutral	what let this down was the car from argus '_s partner goldcar .
positive	also the info on tracking items was very good .
positive	i was directed to knowmalaria by a friend .
neutral	however i think if i had not pushed it would have taken considerably longer .
negative	i pay all of my scottish_power bills by calling the telephone_number shown on the bill .
positive	placed the order quickly and simply , very straight - forward , no_hassle .
neutral	i recently hired a car , collected from perpignon and drop_off in carcassonne .
negative	sent out a part that when opened we found a letter of complaint from a previous customer in the box .
negative	explain what your company pays you for . what exactly do you do ?
positive	easy and simple to buy tyres and first_class fitting with everything included in price . would recommend to anyone
positive	one of those stores that would recommend to my best buddies , promt delivery , fantastic quality in the clothes and what a added_bonus fantastic prices .
neutral	next time i may just bin it !
negative	the smell when cooking meatballs with pasta was reminiscent of rotten cat_food .
negative	i ordered a parcel and sighed when i got the email_saying it had been dispatched with yodel . knowing full well how awful they are !
neutral	sort_out the booking recognition errors and it would be a great service .
neutral	and no cooked meal in morning .
negative	my third time i '_ve_used this company and second time i have not recieved my item , company policy is to blame royal_mail and make the customer wait three_weeks before any chance of getting anything at all .
positive	you will not regret using the store and find yourself coming_back again and again !
negative	i have two lines , one is a local number the other is an 0000 number .
neutral	i am feeling slightly let_down and irritated that ill need to add more brushes to my kit so soon as i feel several of the brushes just don_'_t have the finishing quality look i am looking for unfortunately .
neutral	we were pleased that the car had a fitted sat_nav , but it was set - up in italian ( we were picking the car up in france ) and after quite some time we were able to navigate the italian menus and convert it to english .
positive	<><
neutral	ouch !!
neutral	the product is excellent and i would probably use them again .
positive	however , the ink_cartridges that i received from the cartridge people were so good , i immediately placed a second order .
negative	other dissatisfied_customers please take_note .
neutral	they have again agreed to reimburse me .
negative	disappointed
positive	i needed to buy tools from uk as prices in france are astronomical and the delivery is variable .
neutral	this company charges £_00 . 00 for a domestic service .
positive	great website made it easy to review different_models and the purchase process was very simple .
negative	phoned lastminute to explain . they were no help at all . this company takes your money but if anything_goes_wrong they ' re not interested .
negative	i wish i had !
positive	recommended and i will use again :-)
negative	!
neutral	bit_miffed that the member of staff we had asked for assistance buggered off mid way through helping_us as another customer enquired if she could also get assistance !
positive	good communication between site , hosts and myself .
positive	i thought the produts were reasonably price , cheap delivery , and had what i wanted .
neutral	i informed rodger that if he was unable to assist me then customer_services would , ( at that moment i noticed that the shiny badge was beginning to lose some its shine )
negative	i have used them before with no_problems however on one occasion i sent a parcel which some how ended_up being delivered to a completely_different address .
negative	der rest war noch nicht aufgeblüht .
positive	in fact the last pair i bought , i missed the 0pm_deadline for next_day delivery , but they were still delivered only 0 day later !
positive	very pleased with the safe and simple service , also quick which is a particular bonus .
positive	quick service
positive	the car we were given was a vw_polo 0 . 0 .
neutral	not happy at all with the administrative side of value doors service and our stupidity .
neutral	poor choice of engineering visits - especially for someone_who '_s employed !
negative	flowers finally arrived 0_days_later , the roses were totally dead and the rest of the bunch had seen much_better days - my mum was so upset .
negative	we were told the claim would be setteled but then heard_nothing from them then we got a legal letter chasing for the bill and £_00 legal fee .
negative	if your item actually turns_out to be in stock you might have better luck , but you won_'_t find out till you place your order , then like me , you are stuck with it !!
negative	been in tears .
positive	for what you pay you get the world !
positive	when that didn_'_t work a replacement was quickly dispatched .
negative	so i waited_until thursday 00th_october and surprise_surprise no order has_been delivered , no card has_been left to say delivery has_been attempted .
positive	ordered a pair of rayban rare prints wayfarer and has the title_says received the next_day !
positive	having been quoted more than double the price at kwik_fit i was delighted by the price i was quoted but concerned initially as to whether it was too good to be true .
positive	really good quality blinds at sensible_prices , easy to fit and made to measure
negative	you soon realize what a pointless exercise that is .
positive	it was easy to identify my phone using the drop down_menus .
negative	yodel have obviously made a good sales_pitch to secure the contract but can '_t fulfil any of it .
neutral	we have since received messages addressed to mr rather_than mrs , the mrs who has this web address , and the mrs who paid the deposit .
positive	only issue was due to my post_code being iv00 i was going to be charged £_00 . 00 delivery , but choose my parents post_code ab00 which was 00 miles_away saving myself £_00 .
positive	not this one .
negative	basically said all i could do was apply to switch on the site .

neutral	cover for my galaxy nexus .
positive	i trust this site and i have never been disappointed .
positive	recommended .
positive	not much more can be said - it sells shelves and it does it well .
negative	this company are relying_on the perishable goods_act to get out of refunds and need to be stopped !
negative	this is not clearly_stated on their website - you are offered either 0 - 0 ; 00 - 0 ; 0 - 0 , or 0 - 0 time slots .
neutral	i have bought ilumi products before and i like the food .
positive	an engineer came up to our london office and quickly & efficiently fitted the screen coating .
negative	returned for full_refund and will never be back .
positive	two_days_later in a different site , i had another .
negative	no matter_how much you will save by buying on line dont !!!
positive	the website is easy to use , but if you can '_t find which memory it is that you need , they are extremely_helpful by email or by phone .
neutral	again , they told me there would be some redness but not to this extent .
positive	michel w williams sr
negative	and what did this product do .
positive	so , same tyres , same fitters but at significant_saving .
neutral	messaging no_longer works at 000_% sometimes you send a message more than once or not at all .
positive	highly_recommended !
neutral	rang for an explanation and was told that the prices has changed since i was quoted .
neutral	order delivered promptly ; right medication at the right price .
positive	i get a lot of compliments now on my teeth and looking back my only_regret is not doing it sooner , having gone to many practises and paid for many consultations with no joy i went i to perfect smile studio feeling_confident i was under taking the best treatment for me .
negative	about a week after the money had been taken , a refund came to my card for just the failed booking , not the full_amount i was originally advised - enabling opodo to keep all of the fees and handling charges for the original booking total amount .
negative	whilst we reported the poor condition item received within_00hrs and we notified uksportimports we could not open to xmas day a week_later because difficult with size and keeping secrecy .
negative	my nan was unfortunate_enough to get through and sign up and she '_s had problem after problem and also reports the customer service is lousy .
negative	!
neutral	but ?
neutral	despite_repeated_calls there was no answer and on 0 occasions the phone seemed to be answered and then cut_off .
negative	after an extremely long and painful call with scottish_power i determined that they are stating that the £ 0 i did not pay in respect of my december bill is outstanding and this has_been added to my new bill ( yet all being show as an outstanding bill from december ?).
negative	they have only actually been in touch since this review ?
negative	explain_why i should check your stock_levels ?
neutral	i found i had to lighten dramatically many of the photos which were far too dark in the book .
negative	i emailed thursday half expecting them to make some kind of mess up , and yes ' they ' had arranged the collection from my work .
neutral	as for customer service i can_honestly_say that most of their sales_reps are clueless clothes folders , and as for an afro - caribbean bloke at the pay area near tottenham court road , he was as friendly as a wall of drying paint .
negative	the flowers drooped badly very quickly .
positive	i ordered some ronseal_decking_oil from wood_finishes direct .
positive	i could even afford to buy the largest storage due to the low_prices .
neutral	other than that , good service .
negative	when i brought this to the attention of workwear_express , i was advised that i could buy more shirts from a different manufacturer if i wanted .
neutral	i found the text_message misleading as it indicated there was no one home .
neutral	well i like that there lenses makes your eyes look bigger without looking fake .
negative	i requested a refund but they refused .
neutral	from s s . s s blame royal_mail that '_s not true .
neutral	i think i might just bin the glasses and give up .
neutral	delivery of the both the initial incorrect radiator and its replacement arrived outside the 00 - 00 slot .
negative	i will be switching in the new year when i have the energy for it .
negative	will definitely not buy again .
neutral	a different item was suggested , but according to the website , it was also ' out of stock '.
positive	thank_you , brilliant service fast delivery and best price on the internet , i will be returning .
neutral	normally jessops is very reliable .
negative	quite why dpd delivered to a private house when it clarely should be going to a business is beyond me but the postcode came from your website so it is ultimately your problem to address .
neutral	the flowers were great , and pleased the recipient , which was the main_thing , and delivery was fast and as promised .
negative	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
neutral	this latest club had a 0 rating and i was a little_disapointed with the condition as it was more like a 0_star
positive	from_start to finish i can not fault the service .
neutral	this kept me indoors for the whole of one day , with delivery detailed only as between 0000 and 0000 .
negative	ordered a barca strip for my sons_birthday waited 0_days then checked online tracking and said it was delivered to my ' porch ' 0_days ago .
negative	here i am practically a month later and am still_waiting !
neutral	didnt like the option of were you sit as the airline lets you choose own seat on internet and had to ring up to make_sure you didnt allocate me a seat then my post_code was wrong on my e ticket on payement address a simple mistake just differant accents mis took the t for a g that wouldnt of happened using the internet
negative	quick delivery .
negative	you may as well burn money .
positive	recommended .
neutral	i called dhl , which was a real hassle ( they have no uk customer service number , so i ended_up dialling ‘ international sales ’ and asked them to put me through ), they said that i wasn_’_t in , which i was , and they need the number off the card to rearrange delivery , i had no card .
negative	it was over 0 month before i received my money back on the original purchase , and i received no offer of compensation for my bad_experience .
positive	been a member for about 0 years_now and have no_complaints , cash - back paid on time everytime , no_hesitation in recommending this great service
negative	i arranged for city_link to collect a wheel / tyre in london on the 0th_december_0000 .
neutral	i would look around for a better designed product next time , hence i can '_t recommend this company .
neutral	a good service , in the end .
negative	i ordered a gaggia espresso maker from this company which arrived in terrible condition - box was torn , had obviously been opened before and several of the shiny plates / plastic panels were scratched .
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
neutral	booked to usa and got some good tickets , patient people , good prices , was generally very happy .
positive	the price was competitive and ordering on the website straight_forward .
positive	great service
positive	fantastic and on time .
neutral	screws went in threaded ( in a couple of instances so they actually scratched the doors on opening and closing ), units not lined_up , doors not lined_up , one foot bent in the process , and the top panel scratched due to repeated sloppy attempts to fit .
negative	i am so very disappointed and upset by all of this .
neutral	also there was no gift card included in the box despite the fact that i had written the message i wanted included when making the order .
positive	thanks
neutral	very quick service , but the record that i ordered pressing was terrible ,( burton inc la make you pay ) not very happy as i '_m a dj and i could never play it out .
neutral	a few_days_later i got an email to say the phone had been received , checked over and my cheque would be posted out to me first_class the same day .
positive	he was friendly and cheerful and gave_us good advice about unpacking and inspecting the items .
negative	0 .
neutral	one of the 0 white coats i purchased has a brown stain on the inside .
negative	on the 0nd_august i went into the vodafone ireland retail store in cork and asked if i could purchase a sim_card for use in my mifi dongle , as i wanted to use data while i was in the republic and did not want to pay roaming_charges .
positive	got a choice of how you can be paid .
neutral	having used_serenta_flowers in the past and been happy with their service , i had no_hesitation in using them again , however this time i was very dissapointed with the service .
positive	item received well in time .
neutral	this is the third order i have made the internet sight is excellent , easy to use and order from .
neutral	the idea is grate i managed to get the job_done but . shiply taking £_00 before paying for a delivery service that '_s the cost of a 00kg parcel under common services ups parcel_force etc . makes shiply only useful for large expensive delivery '_s beyond 00kg otherwise you '_ll be paying double if your items 00kg or less .
positive	ordered a number of things from swell everything was tight and right with quick delivery .
negative	which if ( if !)
neutral	very fast service , however prices paid for mobiles are really low .
positive	staff all very polite and friendly too which is always a bonus .
positive	ordered on the tuesday_evening and delivered on the thursday by a very helpful driver .
positive	would definately recommend webtogs .
neutral	i '_m disappointed with the quality the photo looks fuzzy and small frame for the cost .
neutral	delivery was speedy although with a fresh product as this it would be great if the delivery company would give a 0 hour delivery slot as some others do , i did not want to miss this delivery and have it redelivered the next_day , it did arrive on the expected date , albeit at the end of the day .
negative	you will be lucky to get through on their only number , however when they do answer they will be more than happy to take your money but if you have a problem you have to call the same number which they always promise a callback from this socalled customer service team .
neutral	right up until i started unpacking .
positive	well_done oakfurnitureland !!!
negative	i hope the delivery now takes place as arranged .
neutral	a bit disappointed with the lid handle as it is hot when i cook . and also the color on the pot hand is coming off :-(( bought a baking_tray before which i am absolutely happy with but this is a bit of let_down .
positive	i spoke to gordon ( daniel ), and we discussed how many days we wanted in each of our two destinations - san_fransisco and las_vegas - and what kind of expectations we had with regards to budget .
positive	i was quarantined at home due to a contageous illness , desperately_needed printing ink to complete a project .
positive	the replacement product fits well but i did have to telephone to find out the dimensions .
positive	i would recommend them to anyone .
negative	the car was driven round to the front , i paid and started my journey home .
negative	ordered a pair of tyres for a land_rover .
negative	having finally checked in , were again made to queue outside in the rain wth no shelter while we waited for a bus .
neutral	even if you did not get your winter tires you pay extra and get chains . business always wins .
positive	well_done and thanks
neutral	the price was good so i will deal with this company again , but will allow more time for delivery .
negative	check item on site ( still less_than 00 in stock ).
neutral	also lots of items supposedly in stock only to then be told after order accepted not available any more .
positive	very well_equipped , and in a fantastic location .
positive	had really great service from the first phone_call to the fit .
negative	cancelled under dsr and booked it with <_external link_removed >, who turned_up promptly at 0000am , spoke english , and collected .
neutral	back to photobox or someone_else next year .
neutral	this was very annoying .
positive	very good company with good service
negative	please take my warning and do not use them
negative	i won_'_t use this company again .
positive	delivery was quick and we had great communication_throughout .
neutral	the p_&_p was almost £ 0 making my order much more_expensive than necessary .
neutral	i '_m not saying that the site does not pay out , but a couple of jackpots here and there would be nice .
negative	i have had a fault now ( dead line and no broadband ) for over a week and every time i contact them they say ' your fault has_been escalated ' i they escalate it any more it will end up on the moon !
negative	i am literally just ringing a landline .
positive	great website - easy to use and order .
neutral	however on the otherhand once i had spoken to a person at animed the problem was quickly resolved , so all in all at the end i was quite happy with things .
negative	thank god !!!
neutral	!
positive	from a youth centre point of view - our centre has sessions for young people 00 - 00_yrs and we have found over the past few_years that items ordered from the happy_puzzle_company are great for getting young people to socialise and learn with each other .
neutral	was promised a call back for a update , nothing .
negative	i have bought there frequently over the few_years but recently due to new staff i will not be returning .
negative	perhaps they are too busy working their way through the mountaim of complaints in their in - tray , or perhaps they don_'_t care .
positive	the quality of the banner is amazing , the printing is superb and the overall effect is brilliant .
positive	can not fault anything .
negative	so i have brought a lovely set from argos for £_00 . 00 for 0 dumbells because they are sold as a set .
neutral	at over_£_00 we did not feel this was worth the money .
positive	ollie smith looked after our booking and it couldn_'_t have been easier .
neutral	- too accepting of the [_external_reference_] position . "
negative	emails are ( eventually ) responded to by non - english personnel so stuff gets lost in translation !
neutral	fitter did return to replace the sensor foc , but it would have been so much_better if he ' d been properly prepared with spares .
neutral	however , the prices are very good and you get what you pay for .
neutral	great service .
negative	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
positive	they took care of all the necessary_documents and made the process seem so easy .
positive	very good service and quick delivery .
negative	i told them i wanted it and they told me they would send it out straight_away .
neutral	i wasn_'_t pleased with the way the surgeon spoke to me when he was trying to get the plastic mould in place to hold my eye still - this part really hurt .
negative	kundenfreundlich , nein nicht wirklich , zeitgemäss nein auch nicht .
positive	great flowers .
positive	the service is spot_on and the price cannot be_beaten .
neutral	arrived in good time and as advertised .
positive	i especially like the tracking service so you can actually track your order right up to your doorstep .
neutral	amazing roller_coaster arrived promptly and well_packaged .
neutral	in summary - fantastic flowers but terrible delivery process and i won_'_t be using serenata_flowers again due to their use of yodel .
negative	fantastic substitute for cigarettes but it stopped_working after one week so won_'_t be purchasing anything_else from liberty_flights
neutral	!
positive	i have visited the depot in the past and found the team very helpful and even_though i arrived near their closing time they were only too willing to help .
positive	the location was perfect for seeing most of brittany in beautiful countryside .
neutral	this company seems to work well at a good price but uses garages who are making such little margin that i believe it would have probably been cheaper to pay more for the tyres and not get ripped_off on tracking .
neutral	i just couldn_'_t eat them .
positive	the pricing and quality of the products is ideal .
positive	i was a bit_nervous_about this but i can_honestly_say the experience from_start to finish has_been excellent . the furniture was well_packed with no damage on arrival . i would have no_hesitation up until now about recommending this company and i hope that if i had any_problems the customer service would be excellent . i love the furniture and i would buy from this company again . so either the facebook site was set_up by someone with a grudge against this company or there have been problems previously with poor customer service and damaged furniture which the company have worked very hard at turning around and they have succeeded in this .
neutral	other than that nice looking trophies
neutral	i won_'_t order from here again , although the service was good , i would rather pay a bit more and have nespresso .
negative	i mentioned exchanging on the phone and she said " it wouldn_'_t be a problem " but failed to mention the £_00 charge .
positive	collect_+ seems to work well ( better_than post_office ).
positive	i will certainly buy online from dickies again
neutral	i have used wheelspin_models a lot in the past and they are normally very good but i have not received my last order .
negative	in order to get it to move again , i had to get off it and drag it back ( which my father on his own would not manage ) onto level ground and drive 00 yards back to his garage and park it up .
negative	surpirsed they are still in business based on these reviews !
positive	efficient service .
positive	got a great item , good price and quick delivery - what more could you want !
negative	this confusion forced me to call my bank and check my account had not been hacked , and then email you to find out why i had seemly ordered flowers to be delivered to myself at a very old address .
positive	i was kept_informed of order status .
negative	i would not expect to complain to a supermarket to be told to go and speak to the farmer .
neutral	there isn_'_t any explanation for some of the grammatical rules , new sentence structures and suffixes are introduced without_any explanation so i have to use trial and error to understand the context ( and a lot of google translate )
neutral	however photo on cushion wasnt what previewed and ordered .
negative	been sat in all day waiting and still no delivery at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	tried three_times out on the concourse before i got an answer .

negative	at lunch_time , having heard_nothing once again , i telephoned blinds0uk and was connected to the same rude representative i had initially dealt_with , who barked at me " hold on " and placed me on hold .
negative	really disappointed .
neutral	beong a woman on my own i did not appreciate being kept waiting especially when i had not used the company before .
negative	i am going to e_- mail the branch and cancel my order and ask for my money back , it would be a waste of time and the cost of the call to phone hounslow branch .
positive	fast , efficient , friendly service .
neutral	as i would expect from such a company the quality of the product is very good and the speed of delivery was excellent .
positive	expedient delivery , witheasy ways to pay .
neutral	then to find the box the trainers had come in was damaged , ( an_avid trainer collector always keeps the boxes ) so this was a disappointment .
positive	everything from booking to checking in and transfer was simple , quick and efficient .
positive	i can '_t recommend this company highly_enough .
neutral	they had 0_months to tell the hotel about the rooms we had booked and our request to be close to each other , it '_s not as if it was last_minute .
positive	00 months live at an_absolute_bargain price .
positive	this is the second time i have used smith &_morris and on both_occasions i have received very speedy delivery and fantastic quality items .
neutral	opened box and there were a few dents in the corner and edges .
positive	very good company product is as_described .
negative	obviously i have had an awful experience with this company who have taken my money , held_onto that money knowing that they did not have the item to sell !!
positive	great so_far !
positive	the products were brilliant , the customer service first_class .
neutral	but to give credit to get me in , they did respond to this post and sent me further emails_confirming exactly where the tickets were , and have since apologised for the delay .
neutral	glad i left myself plenty of time , before the gift was due to be given !
positive	ordered a poster print and arrived follong morning by post !
positive	the reminder service is especially helpful .
negative	really really bad , i have dealt_with 0 people so far ( in last 0_days ) and no solution so far , only promises that all will work out for me .
positive	every product is very well displayed and categorised professional_manner ,
neutral	i ordered flowers a strawberry bouquet 0_days ahead of time for 00 . 00 , the flowers were dispatched at 0 . 00 in the morning but didnt turn_up till just after 0pm , and the flowers that turned_up contained more daisy flowers rather_than as the picture displayed -- dont_think i will use serenta again --- sorry
negative	update to asda review - it is now months after my original review .
positive	we had a number of issues which included the location of our first villa and villa_plus were very quick to respond to each problem .
negative	it '_s just not that difficult .
negative	however , i didn_'_t expect 0 months later to still not have received my item .
positive	thank_you x
neutral	it is a little sneaky when you think e_- bay is upfront about fees before you list and they have a much larger following .
positive	i ordered two packs of frontline at a great price and they arrived quickly .
neutral	i '_m not psychic couldn_'_t guess if delivered or where .
neutral	course material was complicated on some stages .

neutral	'_s new list of recommended insurers , but we got a quote from them as we had insured with them last_year .
neutral	it wasn_'_t at all straightforward to use .
neutral	offered alternative which was delivered next_day .
neutral	again after waiting_patiently for them to come from france they were a size 0 . 0 .
neutral	i have just found out after 0 phone_calls that it was left at a post_office that i now need to collect it from .
neutral	i re - arranged for fitting on the 00rd , on the 00rd i had a call from the fitter saying he was in derbyshire and couldn_'_t make it .
neutral	two_weeks after ordering we found out that our order had been returned to the courier delivery depot and had to re - order with the happy_puzzle_company .
negative	one of the orders has_been returned , which i know will take an age to get a refund - plus its cost me an extra £_00 for p_&_p for a double duvet_cover value £_00 which was crap !
positive	will definitly use them again .
negative	no offer of any deal they can do on another similar model , simply go away and get another one ….
positive	can '_t be_faulted
negative	wtf ?
negative	still owed £_00 . 00 according to topcashback , but i still_haven_'_t been paid any cash ?
neutral	i chose unibaggage because i thought they would be the end - to - end service provider .
negative	despite the fact that delivery address is an_independent , off - campus house with its own street address , at all times accessible and occupied , serenata decided to take the flowers to the postroom of the college ( not the address i gave them ) as a result they arrived on monday three_days after my daughter '_s birthday and were dried up .
neutral	not the same or similar to a corsa , but politly done .
positive	this is our second mirror from this company both_times have been perfect we would recommend them to anyone .
positive	all in all a very good experience , i will_definitely use again .
neutral	do i really want all and sundry to know that i may have brought bed_bugs back from holiday .?
neutral	i rang up and the customer service attendant said that they had the correct one in stock , and he ' d hold it over for me .
neutral	in addition , i stopped being_able to make card payments temporarily and when i called up my bank , they said that there was a discrepancy and possible fraud on my account which when we looked closer was caused by the fragrance_direct transaction which failed to pass full security because the addresses didn_'_t match .
neutral	now i will have to have it reduced to fit , as it looks silly as it is .
positive	bureau_direct is a find , a treasure_trove of quality materials offered at reasonable prices .
positive	go to just_kampers carry most parts needed if not in catalogue free phone no not all parts are in list no problem in returning wrongly ordered parts

negative	i would give them no stars but unfortunately that isn_'_t an option .
positive	i recommend you try this company if this a course you are interested in studying !
positive	the hardest_bit was putting it in the postbox !
neutral	when some of the 0 days were bank_holidays or weekends or the busiest shopping days in the year , you may have had your doubts and you would have been right .
neutral	i will happily rent with thrifty again but i will not be going through travel jigsaw to get my hire ever again .
negative	the lack of respect in answering potential customer '_s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won_'_t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
positive	i thought the whole_process from ordering , allocaed delivery slots of 0 hours , to final delivery were first_rate .
negative	i contacted them again last_week to ask for some indication of when they issue might be resolved and i '_ve heard_nothing .
neutral	flowers themselves were ok - nothing particularly special , but not misrepresented or anything .
neutral	however , the quality ( given that 0 lights were about £_00 ) was not great .
neutral	+ local_garages
positive	i would agree with other people that you do need to order one size_bigger though as they do come smaller .

positive	delighted with the product and the service , kind_regards , and thanks .
negative	i didn_'_t shout and i didn_'_t give any abuse , even_though i was seething ; but that service was bordering just diabolical .
positive	thanks .
neutral	( note that i had sent my measurements along with my message , to which they replied they couldn_'_t measure the costumes to give me a precise answer ).
negative	viagogo does have a disclaimer on the website saying that times are subject to change but im_sure this does not count when they out the wrong time in the first place and the actual venue has never changed the time !!!!
positive	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal_account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual_online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
negative	0_weeks plus later still nothing , yet another email as you can speak with them ( no phone number ) am now told due to limited production they cant provide a estimated delivery date .
negative	the akinika staff refused to log the dispute and refused to investigate , they simply demand i make payment to them immediately .
neutral	i bought them as matching but they don_'_t .

negative	service provided superb but talktalk will not send invoices out to me in the new business name despite_numerous_calls about this .
negative	asked for a refund four times .
negative	can '_t wait to go back to the store tonight to get my deposit back
positive	most operatives are also happy to discuss that we have diagnosed the correct faulty part before despatching anything incorrectly .
neutral	strings_direct are good for mainstream stuff - i need bespoke and these_guys can '_t be doing with the faff .
positive	i got a very big thank_you from my friend .
negative	reassured on a number occasions i could claim compensation for the loss of service , i continued to pay for a service i wasn_’_t receiving .
neutral	then when it was dispatched , it was delivered to my billing_address and not the delivery address as i had instructed .
negative	lee from yodel , don_'_t even bother mate .
negative	reasons being that i spend at_least £_000 at asda '_s each week , but because i have been having home delivery for at_least 0 years i do not qualify for this service
neutral	i live in australia and thought it would be better to go direct to a company in the uk for this gift .
neutral	don_'_t really need the staff .
positive	only able to comment on clarity of website , ease of use to set_up policy and speed and efficiency of response from questor .
negative	don_'_t buy anything from wayfair . co . uk !
neutral	my sister said the flowers were lovely but i didnt want her to have to lots the same .
neutral	to be fair it was the delivery company that failed to turn_up on the delivery day blaming it on no - one answering a phone .
positive	good choice of kit and extremely competetive_prices coupled_with free deliver made it a no_brainer .
positive	they arrived fairly soon in perfect_condition .
negative	the invitations arrived quickly , but they weren_'_t square ( i could tell that with the naked_eye ) and the envelope stock was so poor that i had to line them or you could see the invitation through them .
negative	i hear this company is owned by the germans . i mean what do you expect .
negative	not happy
negative	not a lot else to say !
neutral	!
negative	after pointing_out it was their lack of fulfilment for next_day delivery and that i refused to pay the saturday surcharge , they agreed to cover this charge ) that was 0_weeks_ago .
positive	easy to use , great variety of products and you get it delivered very fast .
negative	this normally occurs in the event that the address is not valid or if it is incomplete ."
positive	ordered for xmas_pressie for son - superdry '_s biggest_fan !!!
negative	in summary - spend your money somewhere_else , this company will tell you initially they can supply on time , but once they have your money you will be ignored , lied to and then ignored again !!
negative	i await to hear from you please feel free to email me at mike . huston @ ymail . com or you can call me on 00000_000000 .
negative	the handset arrived along with an invoice to say i had been charged £_000 .
neutral	it way too over priced and it took over a week to receive something as simple as spark_plugs .
neutral	my initial_impressions were not great as the staff at pick_up were grumpy , unfriendly , the car was very dirty on the outside despite only have 0 miles on the clock , the inside still had the plastic covers on covered in mud , the aerial hadn_'_t been screwed in yet and the attendant on pick_up was reluctant to let_me check for damage , which made me nervous .
neutral	0 .

negative	som vip kunde i danske bank blev_jeg spurgt om_jeg_ikke ville modtage et tilbud om at samle alle mine forsikringer og flytte dem til topdanmark .
negative	trying to get my phone '_s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers_license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message_confirming that they had my details checked .
negative	to ring the iflorist people
positive	they are always extremely_helpful if i have a question_regarding sizings before i purchase .
positive	great service and really quick delivery .
neutral	i think these are too cheep to be much more than emergency glasses .
positive	arguscarhire provides an invaluable service by searching so many rental_firms and finding most cost - effective cars available .
neutral	considering a brand survives on word of mouth in a very fast pace and competitive market bad_reviews are not what a company needs .
negative	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
negative	however when i came to book the lessons which stated " 00_hours tuition driving test and pass plus " the gentleman explained that i would have to book at_least another 00_hours of lessons on top of this at £_00 per hour .
negative	i got lucky .
positive	which is unusual , as i '_m a grumpy sod .
negative	it gives rise to a cause of action ”.
positive	quite_often a free_postage deal is thrown in too !!
negative	however even if they do respond to customer queries being one good point , it is very much wasted as they are not prepared to do anything about their short fallings and this leave a very bad_taste with regards to their handling of customer_services in the even of them having a disgruntled customer .
neutral	one week_later there is a promotion with a 00_%_discount on the price .
negative	the book is lovely but there is no way i can give it as a gift as the text looks ridiculous and makes no sense .
positive	all i recommend is that all yugioh_cards be available for purchase , other than that a great site and the pricing is soft on the wallet too !
negative	i ordered 0 same day balloons but despite_being advertised that they could be sent alone or with flowers the order was not delivered .
negative	i want my £_000_pounds back and it looks like the greedy people at viagogo are just going to keep hold of it and mess me about for as long as it takesand fob me off with different reasons as to why i cant have it back every time i call customer_services .
negative	however baffling is that have been using my address to shop online and receive stuff all over europe and the us .

negative	it seems that woucher should be more choosy about the companies they are partnering up with !
negative	i have not recieved my order yet , iam still_waiting
negative	to make it worse , after several letters ultimately threatening to take them to small_claims court they then couldn_'_t cancel the order at the shop without my full card_details which implies they pass card payment details to the shop manually rather_than electronically which no doubt means me card_details were exposed to all and sundry along the way .
neutral	i use serenata every time i need to send flowers .
negative	they deliver but dont put a card through your door just leave items on your doorstep or at the side of your house this happened to me they delivered some books i had no card and no idea the items were delivered i contacted amazon and they advised the items had been delivered i checked by my back gate and my books were there ruined as it had rained .
negative	still no sign of it several weeks_later .
negative	they did turn_up with my phone at 00 : 00 , it was a relief .
negative	i contacted customer_services again & this time my order was sent out but i had an e_- mail saying i had set_up a credit account when i hadn_'_t but this is ok if i get my order at the original price charged ie £ 0 not full price without the discount accepted on my original order !
positive	i '_ve_used cabrera_medina a number of times on the island of lanzarote .
neutral	three_days_later nothing .

positive	this is a rare_thing in today '_s world .
neutral	even_though it was past midnight and there were no officials getting people to move along quickly .
negative	i finally got it in my flat , and i '_m really pleased with the mattress , but i do think they should change their delivery company if that '_s the service they give to the customers !
negative	be warned it seems grippy are over inflating themselves and booking more slots than time in the day !

negative	long_story_short the person i spoke to told me i was given a bulk pac_code ( no such a thing !!!
neutral	i tried the 00000000000 number but there was a message_saying to call back during office hours .
neutral	the lack of intervention from ebay is very frustrating when things go_wrong .
neutral	its easy but its costs more than going your self i always get less_than when i go and do it myself you cant look for the deals either !
positive	i received an_email later that day informing_me of the delivery arrangements and i also received a tracking_link from the carrier .
neutral	not sure i would use you again .
positive	i was able to see the quality and finish these were refurbished to and that helped_me to make my mind up .

negative	by somebody ?
negative	as they do not offer telephone contact , one can only get in touch by mailing them .
neutral	would recommend glasses_direct but suggest careful monitoring and use of tracking which is a nuisance and takes time .
positive	hi , just to say your service was brilliant , sandals arrived next_day as promised , can '_t fault at all !

negative	next time -- and sadly we have already booked the same routing in september -- we will wear old clothes and i may just refuse to drive my car the last metre up to the car in front .
neutral	i booked for the next_day first ferry and secured the normal price .
neutral	the shop staff need to be careful who they moan to when i come , one assistant slated me to my partner obivously she did not realise he was my partner , i was not happy also keep getting told by one member off staff that i should take my parcels somewhere_else if i am going to bring them in late .
positive	i would use this service again and again good quality and value for money
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	we have had similar problems with our broadband ( very slow speeds ) which was also with them .
neutral	i again emailed and was told that as they no_longer had the phone they could not verify this .
positive	we were recommended to pharmacy0u by our local surgery .
positive	all in all a very efficient service .
neutral	it timed me out in like 00_minutes of me trying to figure_out if the ticket was good for me .
positive	delivery was great , " i was a bit_worried " but after_speaking to the staff i was happy and would order again and again without_delay .
positive	hole family will be buying there '_s from glasses_direct getting my sunglasses next well after christmas anyway
positive	i would also advise that you ask for recorded delivery as the post_office can be terribly unreliable !
negative	the total_cost of p0go is now to be refunded to me along with a small_amount of compensation .
neutral	this was not a cheap bouquet so somewhat disappointed
neutral	i received a message confirming secure delivery .
positive	fast good and cheap , most unusual in today '_s world .
negative	after numerous_attempts to set_up a payment plan that both_parties were happy with i was advised by quickquid to change my payment date so that my account went into arrears and to call them to set_up a payment plan ( as they could only do this once i was in arrears ) after calling i received no help at all .
neutral	very good and friendly service
negative	i asked to speak to a manager who i begged and pleaded with to get these to the customer on that day to make it in time for the event .
positive	excellent service .
neutral	i put a review on here about our paris trip .
positive	no_hassle web_site , and easy contact if any_problems . 000_% satisfied .
neutral	all in all i just think the memory purchased from mr_memory where just faulty .
positive	bookig was a breeze , cheers_guys :)
negative	mrs nankeville
negative	what i saw today bore_no_resemblance to the illustration on the website .
negative	rentalcars 000000000
positive	i ordered a windscreen_washer pump for a jaguar xj0 , it arrived within two_days packed in protective_wrapping and costing_£_00 less_than main_dealer prices . excellent service with even better prices .
negative	at the moment the guys are getting tyres delivered from elsewhere and hopefully the problem will be resolved sometime this afternoon .
negative	buy from hotrox if you wish , but you just better hope that you don_'_t get a problem . for me this is too much of a risk when you are spending large_amount of money !
positive	the goods were in the local courier '_s hands on friday_morning bit didn_'_t get to me until monday .
neutral	fortunately he investigated , realised who the package was intended for and took it to my sister '_s address .
positive	very fast turnaround of order at great price
positive	looks really beautiful , almost like a piece of artwork sitting in the corner there and everyone who comes round always comments on it .
negative	the poorest customer service i '_ve had in 00 years as customer of goods & services !
positive	the website is very easy to use and you can order as much or as little as you want and you don_'_t have to worry_about ordering a certain_amount to qualify for free delivery .
neutral	after being told around 0000 on the friday when the dellivery was due that it was running a few hours late .
neutral	i bought on the strength of a link on amazon because the price was good .
neutral	needless to say beautychallenge have not done so - nor have the missing items appeared .
neutral	utterly_hopeless certainly describes my initial experience , but once my complaint got through to the correct people the service was good .
neutral	we had 0 journeys booked before the holiday
positive	very polite email received regarding my address .
negative	finally received the product yesterday , not only with packaging in poor condition but also with half the rower missing .
positive	very speedy delivery , reasonable_prices .
neutral	for £_00 . 00 and p_&_p on top i was expecting it to be a lot bigger .
neutral	however despite placing the order at 0am on a thursday and getting a confirmed delivery date of the friday the branch that held the part somehow_managed to neglect to send it either on the thursday or friday .
positive	thanked me for letting them know asbout p_f jones who they are now going to source all their towbars from .
neutral	i was told that was all they had .
negative	by telling the truth in your review it will be removed !
neutral	why not include a copy in the package like other_companies do .
neutral	having contacted them , they offered a further discount and apologised for the state in which it was sent out .
positive	my trophies were engraved and delivered in a very short time indeed .
neutral	flowers were as ordered & delivered on time .
positive	i '_ve not ordered much from these_guys , just some v weights , however the service was absolutely fantastic .
negative	absolute_rubbish as site is a business .
negative	i then questioned the return tracking_number , the shoes were suddenly found !
neutral	these_guys are okay but sometimes there is a stock problem that they don_'_t let you know about until after you '_ve ordered .
negative	only_downside of primark if you want to take anything back you go to customer_services with two people on , queue for ages as everyone takes one item back and pays for two basket fulls while they are there , i recommend that the refunds counter is for refunds only . as i wasted all my lunch hour queing to just get a refund very frustrated , or even more people on to deal with just refunds .
neutral	as a result - local delivery service arrives in the middle of working day , when no one is at home .
positive	no_complaints very impressed .
positive	i was very impressed
negative	what a great customer_relations policy .
negative	i think it '_s ridicules .
neutral	the product is good - unfortunately the blinds came up a little short to fit the window , but that was probably my poor measuring ?
negative	no response within 0 working_days .
positive	i recently_bought a large_amount of flax seeds from the company .
negative	won_'_t trust buying tickets off these_guys again .
negative	they said no as they would lose to much money !!
negative	they weren_'_t , instead preferring to pass the buck and employ delaying_tactics .
negative	first time using the online delivery service and maybe my last , estimated 00 pounds online shopping receipt was 000_pounds , 00_quid of it was for 00 tubs ( they didn_'_t deliver 00 tubs ) of ice_cream i didn_'_t even order , called customer_services and was told they '_d call tomorrow ?
positive	i rang for advice and they were really helpful .
negative	all in all orange are liars and cheats who offer the worst customer service i have had from any mobile or telecommunications company .
neutral	:)
negative	this didn_'_t sound ideal but i was assured this wouldn_'_t affect my right to return them if they didn_'_t fit .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	the price is very competitive , however , when i arrived in cancun , there was no driver with a large sign waiting .
positive	i ordered one day and received the item the next , great service and quality of item .
negative	after many_years posting thousands of parcels via_royal_mail i decided to give interparcel a try due to recent price increases at the post_office .
positive	the apartment was great ( and yes there was internet access ) the location ideal right in the heart of the old town .
negative	again there was nothing from the company so i escalated the claim and paypal received no response from then so they refunded my money .
positive	smooth as old claret .
positive	it has_been planted and now seems to be thriving !
positive	i would recommend them to anyone .
neutral	in my opinion a first_class company let_down by their courier company .
negative	always the same question have you changed the micro filter , router is your phone ok they then say they will run some tests and it could take up to 00_hours .
negative	have rang , left messages and emailed with any answers .
neutral	the size of the bouquet however was bigger_than_expected .
negative	with the amount i paid i expected something outter this world .
neutral	bought the hoodie for my husband for xmas , 0 washes on 00 and the stitching is coming apart so not_overly_impressed .
positive	needed a non standard size box which my usual_supplier did not stock so turned to rajapack .
neutral	however that process was initially painful .
neutral	the replacement unit was received next_day but the missing parts did not .
positive	they arrived on the requested date and having not seen them myself was told that they were really nice . a good selection of flowers for such occasions is available , stunning without being too bright .
negative	ordered on the 00th_november_0000
neutral	also do not pay the £_00 for the welcome_pack , we got a loaf of bread , bottle of water , little packs of butter , a bag of pasta and a small jar of tomato_sauce for the pasta and a very cheap bottle of red_wine .
negative	there '_s lots more to complain_about with regards to the staff and the staff attitude . to be fair , the food is reasonable for this type of place .
positive	partyrama are great they have always provided great products at really good prices and service is always quick and efficient .
negative	i was shaking once i had the door closed .
neutral	despite all of the above : great food , lovely staff , and although i don_'_t think a free drink was sufficient recompense , we needed it !
positive	once again kenable has delivered in more than one way .
neutral	the steering sensor should have been pinned in position so i am told , i am not so sure but i will get around the problem and retain the item .
neutral	can believe that if i was going with a run of the mill industry ( tiling , hairdressing etc ) it would have been a breeze to use .
negative	nor had they been left with the neighbours as requested on my order .
negative	she didn_'_t return .
positive	despite not being_able to find the watch_strap i required ( blue not black ), i placed an order for the black , then had second_thoughts and rang nite , spoke to a very helpful and knowledgeable lady whom pointed_out that they did still do the watch_strap i required in blue , and she would ensure a blue strap was sent as oppose to the black i had ordered due to not being_able to find it on their site .
positive	great site , would definitely recommend to anyone .
negative	furthermore the free chocolates that were supposed to accompany them , did not .
positive	!
negative	i arrived at 0 : 00 and the staff took my keys and told me to wait .
positive	it helped to know exactly when it was to be delivered as well .
neutral	i did not receive an email with log in details either .
negative	cost £_00 .
positive	its made life a lot_easier knowing i have this in place when i am no_longer here .
neutral	the trouble is you get a card from the hermes collector with a tracking_number which is never ever valid i then have to go to interparcel usualy by phone to get info very very annoying !!!!!!
negative	by this time i was starting to feel like a criminal .
neutral	could not fault speed of delivery but item was damaged .
positive	i will_definately use the site again - prices very competitive as well .
negative	funny that .
positive	i would defiantly order again from this website as i got super_fast delivery and the product was what i expected for price .
neutral	heals is a great store and their website is very clear and easy to use .
neutral	ordering easy , prices good and delivery on time .
positive	the assistance i got over the phone was first_rate and the memory arrived the next_day .
positive	would highly_recommend this company
negative	my father agreed with me that the scooter be returned with an explanation as to why it was not fit for purpose and request a full_refund as this was only 0 days after delivery .
negative	my sister had the exact_same hassle .
neutral	i have one or two hour delivery slots from most companies these days so i would have thought this should be better .
neutral	this is the second time we have purchased unit from microdream
neutral	( well . mine hasn_'_t been )
neutral	checked next_day and it said order was closed .
positive	delivery was brilliant too !
positive	the accommodation was actually quite good , much_better_than i expected .
negative	not .
negative	i was informed the cheapest one they do is 00_euros and it comes with 0gig of data , so i purchased this and was told it would be active in 0 mins .
negative	will be seeking a refund now .
negative	or its off to the papers i '_ll go !!
negative	and sent a letter the ireland h . q .
negative	i had appointments to keep , as well you might imagine on the eve of my departure .
positive	operate brake .
neutral	this was a great deal and i saw the same product at my local fancy_dress store for £_000 .
negative	my iphone was coming with yodel .
neutral	white &_bishop initially refused to refund this , despite the numerous errors , but eventualy agreed to pay for return postage too .
neutral	only_criticism that payment took over six days before reaching bank_account .
negative	they seem to treat their trolleys as disposable rubbish in the same way they leave the hedges around the store festooned with their plastic_bags .
positive	i am very happy with the whey_protein i have used as i have used lots of different products from other_suppliers and did not enjoy the tastes or the textures of other brands .
neutral	although the colour was good . it needs a little green sprig or something to make it less stark and sad looking !
positive	i ordered a necklace for my friends birthday , worried that it wouldn_'_t show up in time , but thanks to purpleenchantments it actually came early !
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt on 00 / 00 /_0000
neutral	as a bog_standard delivery company i think they are fantastic and would be my courier of choice .
neutral	poor product advertised very misleadingly .
neutral	but check that everything is right !
negative	i chose and paid for the 0000 model cressi apnea and received the cheaper 0000 model .
positive	ordered a pump 0 . 00_pm thursday expecting to have missed delivery for the day - delivery arrived friday before 00 . 00am
neutral	the prices were better_than any others that i could_find quickly , and they delivered in 00_hours .
negative	stay well clear !
negative	she also blamed their supplier for the shortfall in the number of chains , thus telling_me they do not check orders before they go out .
positive	hey ' try animed_direct their the muts nuts .
negative	in engine a plastic cover taken off , could not beleive state our car was in , told driver we will follow him to speak to manager , instead he sped off .?????
positive	great service
positive	the packaging was excellent epsecially the super strong_magnets needed special treatment .
neutral	the manager was pleasant and polite on the phone and gave them to me on the price match but i suspect anyone without good knowledge on this sort of thing would be left without .
negative	last_week i tried to purchase salter knife_sharpener , although it was in the old and new catalogue they were not able to supply it .
positive	the quotes and designs came promptly back and i was presented with a very professional looking set of designs .
neutral	saturday for a check up and am just hoping there is something
positive	i would use again .
negative	do not do_business with this company - they supplied faulty goods and when returned did nothing to replace or refund - they dont answer their customer service telephone line nor do they respond to email enquiries .
negative	their showrooms are therefore mis_- representing the quality of the products they sell .
neutral	surely , a postage cost of around £ 0 cannot be justified for a low value order ?
neutral	!
negative	this could be an amazing service that more people would use if they actually did what they said they were going to do .
negative	how wrong they could be !
positive	this was such an easy booking experience .
neutral	i bought my wormers with the expectation , based on reading_reviews that my
neutral	love my fit_flops
negative	i am so glad that he kept the email trail as without_seeing it for myself , i would never have believed that a customer service team would respond in such a way , unless the person in question had just won euromillions and didn_'_t give a toss .
negative	do not use o0 as your network !
negative	and i should have read you all first !
neutral	i have had to on occasion phone up and ask for my invoice , the people there are very helpful and quickly email me the invoice , but i ' d rather not have to phone in the first place .
negative	price for machine was good , but when you add on there delivery charge basically the same as all the others .
positive	i have just used barrington_sport for the first time and had wonderful service .
negative	this shocking service is not just a one off it happens every week . we ask , they promise , it doesn_'_t happen !
negative	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
neutral	on the plus_side it was easy to send them back in the same envelope with postage paid .
neutral	ordered and paid for a landscape photo_book for a recent_trip to london which was for a special_occasion .
positive	they look really good .
negative	tesco is phenomenally dreadful when it comes to displaying goods on offer .
negative	i have two phones , one with three and another one with o0 , its amazing the difference_between one and the other .
negative	this was a thankyou gift for my mother in - law .
positive	great service and value for money all_round
positive	i ordered a t - shirt in the evening , they posted it the next_day , it arrived the day after that .
positive	i was kept_updated through the whole_process i . e from ordering the flowers to the delivery .
positive	it was the first time i had ever made a photo_book .
positive	i have been having issues which i '_m seeing a physio for now and one of the exercises used a wobble_cushion to strengthen my calf and achilles .
negative	i received a text thanking_me for upgrading , i immediately called them and advised i hadn_'_t , and had cancelled my contract - they put me on to their fraud dept who advised my new phone was down to be delivered to london - advised i live in manchester and had not ordered it - they confirmed they would cancel the order .
negative	and to add_insult in injury there staff seem to think they can tell us what we should or shouldn_'_t do and expect us to work for free , why they reap the rewards .
positive	it is extremely easy to use , and the best part about this website is that they will match the price of any other website with an additional 0 %_off the competitors price .
negative	total_joke of a company
negative	i have this escada rio perfume and it just finished and i have been looking for a good deal and i found it in cheapsmells . com .
positive	i will probably include more of their products on my next order .
positive	would recommend this product .
neutral	not great value for money .
positive	tharon chivers
negative	i received an_email on the 0th_jan ( 0_days_later - 0 working_days ) saying my order had only just been dispatched !
negative	00th of june now !!!
neutral	you pay_peanuts , you get monkeys .
neutral	pleased to find injury specific tape and a good shop online !
positive	thanks , claire
positive	it '_s so much_easier !
neutral	this was at the end of the day a list of human_error and my warning to you is check the paperwork thoroughly .
negative	having sent them photos and numerous_messages asking for an update on the situation we '_ve still received nothing from them .
negative	this is hard to believe when i still have a bean_bag from ikea bought 0 years_ago which is still completely intact !
positive	i bought a mini theremin through juno on friday £_00 less_than other_retailers selling the same item .
negative	unless you order for christmas in march then suggest you leave tmart well alone
neutral	( what ' a that all about ?).
neutral	it took 0 goes and a lot of wasted time over 0_days to order what i required via the website .
positive	will use therug house again and have recommended them to all my family and friends .
neutral	i change to morrisons and now spend at_least £_00 a week there .
positive	we also got a call from the delivery driver to check we ' d received the text and to confirm the slot .
negative	i was at first impressed by such a huge product range available so thought i would take_advantage and buy a few items .
positive	we were travelling on the saturday with little idea of our time of arrival , so it was with some_trepidation that i placed my order for flowers with a company i had picked from the net with no prior knowledge , for delivery at the home of a friend who i didn_'_t know would be in !
positive	delighted with my sunglasses and also with the 00_%_off offer for first time customers .
neutral	i reported this immediately , emailing a photo of the faulty part and requesting a replacement part .
positive	item received in time !
positive	booked some follow on work with them ( mot )
positive	goods arrived promptly .
neutral	i was unable to be in for the delivery x 0 from parcelforce so i nominated a local post_office to collect it from ( tuesday ).
positive	this is the way that all companies should treat their customers .
negative	contacted the seller again this morning to complain ( as complaints to yodel are usually ignored / responded to with ' we don_'_t know ) and i was assured that the parcel was out for delivery again today and that i would get it today .
positive	will use them again
negative	talktalk is not a reliable company .
neutral	however when asking about delivery time i was told 0 - 00 days or similar and when i commented about getting it sooner the session was terminated with no warning .
positive	fantastic !
neutral	users need to be aware of very low and clearly unrealistic prices being submitted by some hauliers .
negative	called on thursday to see if it had been delivered , answer was no however they would call me at 0am on the friday_morning to give me an estimation on delivery time , no call was made .
negative	looking at the website i genuinely was impressed but the quality of the garment and the tailored fit was poor , as was the material which had stiching flaws .
positive	the tablet was delivered next_day and in perfect order .
neutral	the ordering_process was excellent and being_able to configure an all in one pc to a very high specification for the price was a big plus .
negative	i regret that we will not be able to reach an amicable resolution to your complaint .
neutral	!
negative	i feel very let_down by this experience with proridermobility . com so before you buy from them rather_than another supplier be warned !!!
positive	it could not have been easier !
negative	very disappointed and still do not know when i can expect delivery .
neutral	had i known , i could have bought them locally for less .
negative	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
neutral	my advice the the management remember that pride always comes before a fall .
neutral	in the end it did turn_up next_day , so im none the wiser why it was cancelled in the first place
neutral	to be honest , i only went back to kwikfit for the sake of convenience , because they offered a home service .
negative	as for the length , this is not something i was expecting to have to check as i had ordered off the back of what we already had , and therefore i did not check this .
neutral	can '_t comment .
positive	brought this easy leader for my dog .
negative	purchased a recliner_chair on dec . 0th 0000 , payment by paypal , upon delivery on dec00th , item was found to be damaged .
neutral	seemed to take loads longer_than it should have done , but got my money in the end .
neutral	it was marked ' despatched ' so that '_s how i knew that it was on the way .
positive	one of the items ordered had a small scratch on the front of the appliance .
negative	they ensured me this would only take a few_days unlike the first ocassion that took 0_weeks .
positive	well signed and easy to navigate website .
neutral	these mistakes were handled very efficiently and courteously , but they shouldn_'_t have happened in the first place .
negative	i tried to email them and the email bounced , website gone and domain_name expired .
positive	it will be the crowning glory of our new home !
negative	allin all this bed has turned_out to be massively expensive in more ways than one !
positive	thanks heinnie_haynes
neutral	.
neutral	i consider myself duped !
positive	i could write reams ( this is edited anyway ), but you get the idea by now !
positive	gave constant_updates by email as well as by phone .
neutral	but there was a bit too much " filler " as_opposed to flowers .
neutral	to get any information had i to go into my account and that wasn_'_t update therefore we had to ring customer_services to find out about our order and they in turn had to speak to the supplier of the computer to find out what was happening to our order .
positive	the goods were despatched quickly , packaged well & the price was good .
negative	avoid this seller !
positive	very helpful attitude from tooled_up staff when delivery was delayed - entirely the fault of the carriers , not tooled_up .
neutral	surprisingly for a french boat , the coffee would have been drinkable with some actual coffee in the cup .
neutral	i was then told they would check the info i had sent .
positive	service .
negative	i had non_stop problems with their internet which their staff are unable to sort_out - they are frequently very rude and / or cannot_speak_english properly , so you have a lot of trouble trying to understand what they are saying .
neutral	wish you would use the postal service and not apc .
negative	received cheque for 0 .
positive	good product at a reasonable price .
positive	the aftercare has_been exemplary , all appointments on time and by very professional people .
neutral	always love the gear and prices - always get_stung by tagging on the vat at the end of the order .
positive	they are definitely authentic , and i am definitely thrilled !
positive	hassle_free .
positive	so would highly_recommend purchasing from them .
negative	and the estimated delivery was 0_weeks , which is strange considering when i checked again there was 000 + in stock apparently .
neutral	i was then told by the guy there is no need to check we just pay for any damage !
neutral	delivery was wicket than i expected however i ordered a travel set and something had leaked in it ruining the lining of my new vanity case .
neutral	i '_m_sure my other half will enjoy this pistol of rum , the only_thing i was disappointed about was that it didn_'_t come in a box , which it was pictured with !
positive	it was delivered on time , unpacked and put on the bed for me , and away we went .
neutral	the full_tank only held £_00 so how one tiny bar ( three bars make up a quarter of a tank so 00 in total from empty to full ) can equate to £_00 beggars_belief !
positive	the villa was lovely and perfect for a family holiday .
positive	the delivery guys were first_class .
neutral	when item was delivered it was a sense of relief .
negative	great !
positive	we paid the extra £_00 to get the chrome model which i think is worth it as it is an expensive thing and the white one just has a bit of a cheap look about it to me .
negative	sarah
negative	his experience was equally as bad as mine .
positive	i thoroughly_enjoyed using music_magpie , it was quite simple and easy to use .
positive	have come away with lots of ideas just need the time to put into practice in my working life .
neutral	however the glasses frames doesn_'_t my face properly .
negative	yes i '_m furious !
neutral	ordered 00 april - arrived 0 may .
positive	they pre_- quoted the best price compared to other recyclers .
negative	after dealing_with their awful customer service , i realised that them saying my refund was being_processed was a complete lie given my order was being delivered the same day i was supposedly getting my money back .
neutral	dissapointed that my first order was not dispatched until 0days after i ordered it which_meant i couldnt start my trial on time .
negative	would not shop_here again .
neutral	it is obvious that the courier let you down which is a shame as it tainted the whole_process for us .
positive	the fact that you are in a chat room , took away any pressure you can sometimes feel when dealing directly with a salesman and i was never pressured_into buying the watch but was given friendly advice about choosing the correct watch within my budget , all in the comfort of my home .
neutral	so not the best of experiences unfortunately .
negative	very sad as great company with a lot of lovely people who you only get to speak to if !!!
negative	i placed an order for two items - syringes and melolin pads ( basic medical items ).
neutral	there wasn_'_t even any kind of apology ( considering there is no mention on the website that they don_'_t do price matching retrospectively !!)
positive	i will definitely recommend this company to my friends and colleagues .
neutral	despite purchasing the thinnest_lenses online – the site suggests these are the only thin_lenses available – they arrived and were noticeably thicker than my existing same prescription high_street glasses .
neutral	still_unresolved by it , have now requested account to be closed .
negative	my email to the company was unanswered .
neutral	reliability , customer service , and customer value is very important too .
negative	why have a part on the booking form for requests when there is no chance of getting what you request .
positive	0_stars from me fast delivery and progress texts all the way with a 0hr delivery slot .
negative	they may be cheaper_than some other courier companies , but with myhermes , you don_'_t even get what you pay for .
neutral	the sandles i received were birkenstock " birko - flor " made of a synthetic product for those who choose not to wear leather .
positive	the switch arrived the following_day .
positive	would recommend paymentsense to anyone as the service i received from the start till end was amazing and very helpful .
negative	i have also had problems submitting meter_readings to fu and when i have managed to do this they " havent " recieced them .
positive	perfect .
negative	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
positive	brilliant efficent service .
positive	it took only 0 days for a whole recycling proceess .
negative	i bought this hamper as a present for my mothers 00th_birthday .
negative	on the day the t - shirts where due be dispatched , workwear emailed me to tell me that they where unable to fulfil my order until the week after offering me a refund on the express delivery which was absolutely unacceptable as the t - shirts was for an event that weekend , this left me 00hours to either find another company which were able to screen print the t - shirts , or let the 00 children know they will have no uniform for their big event .
neutral	they obviously did not arrive and felt annoyed that they should have been delivered so close to the noon deadline .
positive	when i received the parcel it was very well_packaged , and upon_opening , the items inside were also neatly_packed .
negative	ordered react to light lenses , also load of rubbish .
positive	it has_been a pleasure to deal with such an efficient company . we wanted an item ( a new loo_seat to be exact ) but weren_'_t sure of size etc .
positive	great website , easy to search for items in the sizes you want .
negative	this is the worst delivery company i have ever had any dealings with .
positive	would use mike '_s dive store again .
positive	v impressed !
positive	my order came very quickly and even_though i had to return my order due to the costume being too small the returns_procedure was simple and my reorder was also delivered quickly .
positive	makes giving these items much more affordable , and with 0 dogs and 0 cats every little helps !
positive	thanks again , jay and all the best to you .
neutral	customer service didnt sound professional enough .
positive	i would not_hesitate to order from this company again in the future .
neutral	stephen martin
neutral	paid for delivery on a tuesday , finally delivered on the friday after an e_mail and a phone_call .
negative	i will be avoiding ryan_air in the future .
negative	this is not even possible as i have only used the phone for a total of 00mins and sent 0 texts , i haven_'_t used 0g at all or sent multi - media messages etc so it is literally impossible .
positive	very satisfied customer .
negative	?
positive	this is great when i am so busy and need that support .
neutral	said i had a discount_code .
neutral	but thought that it would be worth if for my friend .

positive	i even buy from some traders on their site and found play to be very helpful if / when any_issues_arise .
neutral	!!
negative	i used this company due to it '_s convenience and had my car collected from work .
positive	the guy phoned me on the morning to say what time he was going to be with me , and he arrived on time and was friendly , professional and fitted the replacement tyre in less_than half an_hour !
positive	i will_continue to use & reccomend .
positive	i am very impressed with the packaging of my order each item being individually packed and labelled neatly .
negative	you may pay a little more but you '_ll get a better customer experience by far , and should anything go_wrong then you can talk to them direct instead of a 0rd_party such as p0go !
negative	i suggested that they knew they couldn_'_t fulfill the order when i first made it - and suggested they have a word with their it people to prevent orders at the point of payment .
neutral	the size of costume and belt attachment were spot on , no_complaints , the actual costume decoration however was poor and basically starting falling_off from the moment i opened the packaging , over the course of the evening which involved nothing more strenuous than a little dancing to a few classics i would estimate that 00_% of the costume decoration came away , nothing drastic admittedly but not great .
negative	awful customer service , rude and arrogant .
neutral	it was also delivered very quickly .
positive	best price for food_processor that we wanted .
neutral	when the delivery arrived the van_driver phoned me because he couldn_'_t find our office , although we receive a number of parcels every day and they all come straight to our door .
positive	it all went to plan and my family could plan their life around this . perfect !
neutral	used to be my # 0 casino to make deposit '_s but my experience suddenly changed !

negative	thats_why i took the price in the first place its one big joke , like i say never will
negative	after calling customer_services and being on hold for a total of 0 hours , i finally got through to the right people and by this stage i was happy to cancel our account all together .
neutral	it easy sending money to the philippines .
positive	the rugs are well illustrated on the website and are just as good if not better when laid on the floor .
negative	so obviously customers requirements are immediately disregarded .
neutral	could have been very nasty don_'_t these_people care ?
neutral	used this company as needed fast delivery and because the website showed whether products were in stock or not . or so i thought .
negative	!
negative	when the package turned_up , the delivery note said both items were present , when only one was .
neutral	didn_'_t realise before i ordered , but use citylink to deliver , who i avoid like the plague unreliable , and rare places to pick_up .
negative	i '_ve just found this website - wish i had before placing the order .
neutral	easy to use the pre booked system .
positive	i '_ve been ordering from lenstore for two years_now and was so happy that there is such a reliable service .

positive	well_done it makes a refreshing_change to receive excellent service .
neutral	bad - some legs only appeared sporadically on web_site , no amex , no ability to choose seats , not all fares available , it wanted to charge me more for my 00month old daughter !
neutral	however i ordered 0 boxes each containing 00 sachets .
neutral	i had to remove various ends of threads from sleeves , close to zip areas and even the superdry logo ( orange at base of right sleeve ) was not attached well or carefully .
negative	on contacting curry '_s & spending 00_minutes on the phone i was promised a replacement ( a further delivery of fridge_/ freezers expected on the 00th ).
neutral	sorry !
positive	quite the opposite .
neutral	i have ordered from this company sometime ago and found the service speedy , however this does not seem to be the case now and i have concerns : -
neutral	however , the web_site makes little sense .
neutral	on delivery they were damaged due to not being packed properly ( they are china mugs ).
neutral	they leaked when they were installed .
negative	before that i was a director of a freight / courier company in london for an equal amount of time .
neutral	iv had a full set of tyres_fitted to my focus rs with no_problems in the past but i had 0 tyres fotted to my girlfriends mini and im quite dossapointed with how the fitter treated the alloy_wheels .
positive	i use greenman to get add - ons to my issue kit , they supply top quality products at excellent prices .
positive	i will certainly be purchasing my wedding_invitations from here as well .
neutral	indeed , i had initially wanted to get the glasses corrected , but i thought £ 0 each time i needed to return them to get them adjusted was too expensive .
negative	prams were put against doors so you could only enlight from the front doors next to driver .
negative	i then had the nightmare experience of actually trying to speak to someone at amazon , is anyone actually employed on customer service , no human voice can be found ?
neutral	reduce the amount of time that an order takes to process , it reduces the
positive	i received notification the next_day that my massage_table had been dispatched , it arrived in good order the following_day .
negative	worst delivery experience i '_ve ever had !!
neutral	customer service is very friendly and willing but a bit amateurish .
positive	thank_you very much for your excellent service .
neutral	hope it is still with the courier and it will come next week .
positive	i had my 0 old_phones for a while , not knowing what to do with them . my eldest_son recommended mazuma .
neutral	thankfully there was no hurry to get this item but i am surprised i was not kept_informed about the long wait and given an opportunity to cancel the order .
positive	as usual i am_delighted when my wife is happy .
neutral	it exhibits a lack of professionalism and a lack of respect .
negative	they wrote back saying they do not do refund unless it is 0_days late again citing they do joy guarantee delivery on the day you pay for in their terms and conditions .
positive	i highly_recommend them .
positive	e . mail tracking from dv000 also really good . and of course the choice of product and price were excellent .
positive	damn fine service .
neutral	safepay does not allow drop down_menus for calendars etc , from the bank sites it '_s protecting .
neutral	delivery .
positive	also they sent me sweeties in my package .
positive	the website was easy to use and importantly identified the correct_part .

neutral	i ' d also echo the comments about the high sugar content of some of the snacks .
negative	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
neutral	this could have been a good experience but my new tyres did not arrive at the fitting garage at the time requested .
negative	this is a fake site .
positive	the veteran players i met laughed when i told them that not only had my first hand played online , but my childhood was spent at poker the virtual field and of course games for kids online .
negative	it arrived 0_weeks_later as flat_pack .
positive	the costumes are great and there is such a hugh choice , i can spend_ages just deciding on an out fit !
positive	i was wary of ordering on line .
neutral	in this day and age things should be despatched the next_day if not the same .
positive	it all arrived on time and both me and my wife were very pleased with our purchase !
negative	also pointed_out in the email that i would be prepared to ship them the incorrect one if they could ship me a replacement .
neutral	i was also disappointed with the fact i said if the recipient was not in , to leave them with the neighbour but they were left on the porch and i later found out someone was in and the doorbell wasnt actually rung .
negative	please issue me now my full_refund
neutral	not great service .
neutral	other than that all fine , price was low , customer service is friendly .

negative	i have had more than one problem with this branch .
neutral	when the flowers arrived i was expecting more than what arrived .
neutral	they were not able to phone my dad , even_though the number was given to them , so this caused more difficulties on the morning .

positive	this is the second pc i have bought from you , and would recommend you to anyone .
positive	i would recommend him and the company 00 out of 00
positive	was delivered to my door , will definitely use this service again .
positive	i think actions speak_louder_than words and the fact that this is my first_port of call on a monthly_basis speaks_volumes .
negative	i now expect an automatic e_mail in response to this but it will be too little too late .
neutral	arrived on time , but too much greenery and foliage and not enough flowers .
negative	so much for ordering the correct_part from partmaster .
negative	no tv arrived and i received no phone_call .
negative	you admitted on the phone that the advert was misleading , you even suggested we cant send you what the advert suggested i should have recieved because you didnt have the full set in stock !
negative	my order was not processsed for a week , when i queried this the customer suport rep told me " oh i will need to check with the warehouse , i don_'_t think they got the email "
positive	0 ) had to set_up two new accounts with new emails adds
negative	when i replied that i already had , and that their response was in relation to that , i heard no more .
negative	ruined day
negative	the reply was that under their terms and conditions they had 00 days from date of cancellation to refund .
positive	and the bouquet which was delivered on the saturday rather_than sunday also enclosed a £ 0 gift voucher !
neutral	i would still recommend them to people though , but warn them to check their orders !

positive	i was also given updates advising me of the ' hour and minute ' ( between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 ) and goods arrived in perfect_condition at 00 . 00 !!!
negative	discussion thread
neutral	sorry that you thought that the delivery would be faster .'
positive	my first_impression of the company was the friendly human side of things - so rare_these day it seems !
neutral	apparently they were going to attempt delivery but it was definitely scheduled in for the saturday if no one was home .
positive	easy to order - no_fuss and arrived on time .
neutral	perhaps i should have given the company the chance to refund me but i feel that if they are going to sell cheap and nasty that people should be warned .
negative	despite having both my email address and phone number they decided to assume that it was okay to replace the silver battery with a blue one because apparently they are out of silver .
positive	fantastic range of products .
positive	best prices on the net
positive	seats were booked and paid for online .
neutral	i think the prices are good which helps .
positive	you will not find a better , cheaper service anywhere_else in the midlands .

neutral	handset never delivered , but they couldn_'_t find it without ' telephone_number '.
neutral	i was phoned by two of the firms before i ' d even had a chance to look at the quotes ( all very similar ), and that impressed me .
negative	turns_out my entire account had been cancelled so i had to create a new account and the stupid guy in sales could not even reference my previous order . some bulls_** t about different systems . whatever .
neutral	there are circumstances where the delivery is not free - this should be notified on the order so that the customer is aware .
positive	i would highly_recommend wiggle to any cyclist .
negative	0 ) they stuck to their rote learnt bookish lines insisting i give them item number .
positive	the service i got from this company displayed efficiency and knowledge of the products they sell .
negative	i felt_like walking out and going elsewhere !
neutral	apart_from that customer_services were quick responding and helpful and ordering and speed of delivery was good .
neutral	i was really happy to continue re - ordering this product but , as i '_m now unable to order the minimum to qualify for the 00_%, i '_ll be ordering a different product elsewhere .
negative	so i stated i needed the pram asap and stated i was told i would have it this week and explained i had 0 days to cancel the transaction and said if the service is this bad please_accept my request to cancel , they then agreed to refund me i did actually receive the refund within 0 days but was shocked when they said : refunds can take up to 00 days but we aim to have these done with 0 - 00 working_days .
positive	they were the cheapest , and the next_day i was emailed with a delivery eta .
negative	arrived two_days_later from order .
positive	easy to order and very fast delivery
positive	item was a very good price .
neutral	we have thus sent the boots back and asked for an exchange ( in this instance ).
neutral	also my fitter can not finish of my kitchen because of the delay
negative	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
negative	the description said good workin condition .
neutral	have returned it and am awaiting news !
positive	great .
neutral	however , it was not until i had contacted currency direct in spain a few_times that we were informed that they had no details of where to send the money !
neutral	it was left_behind bins .
negative	my advise pay the extra and use another company .

positive	as i knew the make of stick i wanted and the size the choice was easy , the fact that it was £ 0 cheaper_than elsewhere made it all the sweeter !
positive	great job .
positive	really good items of quality .
positive	the drawers are quite spacious too and it is very well made .

positive	they called me back within the hour with three suggestions for diamonds and some very good advice .

negative	ruined my brother in law '_s birthday
negative	after waiting for 0_weeks i got fed_up with all abbeys excuses , got husqvarna involved and they sent me a new blade themselves and it arrived the next_day , as abbey still hadn_'_t sent one .
positive	!
neutral	i then had a week of emailing back and forth with no real alternative options or help forthcoming .
negative	none of the aforementioned was delivered which meant that my mother actually received nothing on her special day !
neutral	this was our 0th time with villa_plus and we were a little dissapointed this time .
neutral	but that '_s the idea .
negative	!

neutral	but the costume had a hole in the leg .
positive	i ordered a watch which arrived within 0_days and was competitively_priced .
neutral	i do not find the website easy there is no obvious place for delivery notes or to enter special_offer code ie free delivery this should not be included as an extra if it is supposed to be free
negative	the companies tendency to almost always side with a buyer even when the buyer is pulling an obvious scam or when the post_office confirm the seller did send the item , the item was delivered and in some cases even when the post_office provide evidence that the buyer even signed for an item they later claimed not to have received , has naturally lead to a huge increase in fraudulent charge - backs and buying scams .
positive	great rate and great service - will use again
negative	i ordered some flowers for my wife '_s on our_anniversary .
positive	found it very easy to identify the correct parts and place the order .
negative	it wasn_'_t the worry free experience the guarantee offers .

positive	i would have no_hesitation in using this company again and will be ordering all our dog_food from now on from here .
neutral	as much as i enjoy shopping in hobbycraft , i '_ve found slowly but surely that production selection has_gone down within my favourite section of craft .
negative	they incorrectly booked one of our flights despite it being right on our e_- ticket .
negative	it would be cheap if it wasn_'_t so completely and utterly unprofessional and useless .
positive	transferwise is actually the best idea ever .
neutral	they said they would refund the postage it cost me to return it , but as soon as i said i had sent it , i haven_'_t received an email or refund from them .
neutral	good service at black_circles but a day late due to courier problems

negative	i ordered a couple of items a week_ago , 0 item being a vision battery 0000mah in silver .

positive	everything received as ordered , safely and securely_packaged .
negative	so i '_m not seeking_legal_action_against them .
negative	would not advise them to anybody .
negative	instead of an e_mail saying sorry . how about you compensate me for the 0 hours ive wasted chasing this missing parcel and sack the driver who cant even remember where the parcel went ?
positive	it was exactly_what i was looking for following the recommendation on their web_site regarding blinds for a kitchen .

neutral	i have never been unable to find the place i am searching for , and have stumbled_across some great places by_accident .
positive	the cleaner did a great job !
neutral	i waited but the problem continued and was left without access to funds in my clear account all night .

negative	some of the flowers were clearly dead as they had gone brown .
negative	we sent it for repair just out of warranty .
positive	it looks like great quality :) and will do what it says on the tin .
negative	low quality service by undertrained staff .
positive	some of my favourite flavours come from their range ( the lemon meringue , blackcurrant ice and green giant all come with my hearty recommendation ) and the delivery service from the website is reasonably swift , even on large orders .
negative	i '_m totally perplexed on how tyre_shopper can have a link to tyresafe '_s website on it '_s homepage if they are advising customers into having two different brands on a drive axle
positive	fully recommended .
positive	hostelbookers had great information on the hotel , as well as photos and reviews .

neutral	sort our your service betta_living and you would have a great business here !
negative	another big_mistake !
negative	the gentleman i spoke to was totally unhelpful and obstructive .
positive	the delivery man was polite and efficient .
neutral	the mountings when they arrived were so insipid and washed out in colour that they almost all looked the same - a sort of yellowy magnolia - instead of the vivid yellow we were promised from the website for two frames and a cream for another frame .

negative	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
positive	i will not_hesitate to use watchfinder again in the future and cannot recommend them highly_enough .
neutral	if you order ask to speak to gary and check progress , i understand they get a build up of orders then get the appliances in and make you wait , i was lucky but i persevered !!
neutral	as well as my own package i received an extra one , addressed to me but the photographs inside were not mine .

negative	when i did get through and explained that the app isn_'_t working_properly they were of no help what so ever - i don_'_t really think they know how it works themselves .
neutral	clean .
positive	easy to use got 0 quotes fast so very happy .
negative	these tyres were offered as tyre of the week .
neutral	as a female , i was left helpless .
negative	the item was worn twice and the seam came undone and frayed
neutral	the parcel arrived quickly however i was disappointed to find that the dress was not accompanied_by the underwear .
negative	also after noticing on our e_- ticket that they hadn_'_t booked us baggage , we rang up to enquire .
negative	when i got home i weighed it . 00 . 0kg .
negative	signed_up with them over 0 months_ago and never got the channels i paid for so didn_'_t pay my bill .
positive	thank_you .
negative	in my mind why do we have to pay the same for a download as they real thing .
negative	pay more elsewher and enjoy the experience .
neutral	i pictured my sister getting a knock on the door and opening it to find her surprise flowers !
neutral	i had so many people asking me where we were staying as they wanted to know what they were paying for but couldn_'_t tell them !
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	eventually he realised it was actually possible to leave his chair and go and look in the warehouse for my order .
negative	i complained to their head_office and was eventually offered a free wheel_balance as compensation but by that point i ’ d already got a cheaper quote for the same tyres with wheel_balancing thrown in anyway .
negative	the tap was faulty !!
neutral	so , after being up , ready for a delivery at 0000 hours , it was particularly irritating to be telephoned about 00 . 00_hours to be told the delivery wouldn_'_t be made that day and we would have to wait_until the monday .
positive	x
positive	i look froward to using them again .
neutral	it '_s clear that there are some teething_problems with this service .
negative	also the recipient was in the house but the deliverer did not ring the bell .
negative	service is dreadful and now the account_manager is now a team and not just one person .
positive	staff are v helpful and they do not mind sending out small orders .
positive	nothing else to say .
negative	at last i have got my refund of over £_000 , but it '_s taken almost a month .
negative	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that ’_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
neutral	delivered promptly however the labels on the bottle are coming away from the bottle and that should not really be happening .
positive	good service , correct items and a fast and reliable delivery .
negative	do i think they will care ?
positive	brilliant service and value for money , saves the cost of a new vacuum , easy to order web_site . will use again when i need anything .
positive	excellent service and quality !

negative	?
negative	0 times i '_ve sent emails to them asking to stop sending to me requests to pay , my emails were ignored !!!!
neutral	i returned the original filter to partmaster using a label provided by them to pay the postage myself and obtain a full_refund .
negative	there '_s many contributing factors why this just doesn_'_t work for puspose of home delivery .
negative	this is with allianz ,
neutral	order confirmation , dispatch confirmation and delivery was prompt on both orders .
positive	the difference with mrmemory is that they sent through and email containing a link for a video which showed clearly and simply how to install the new memory .
negative	fair_enough , they do not claim to supply a business - strength service but an_apology rather_than a load of criticism of me ( the customer ffs !)
positive	topcashback is a great idea and i dont understand_why you would shop without its free money i have been using it for about a year and wish i knew about it sooner thanks topcashback < 0
positive	thank_you for your prompt response to our request , will be using your site again soon .
negative	they took all of my documents and then hassled me to sign a credit agreement .
positive	excellent .
positive	it looks fantastic on my decking .
positive	excelent choice on website , great prices , great service , quick delivery .
neutral	delivery men were quick , but chose not to wear boot covers in our new home .
negative	on the upside they do tend to answer the phone '_s quickly ( never more than a 00_min wait so far ) but the fact i even need to make these calls in the first place is atrocious .
positive	wanted a knights costume for a new years party im attending , saw just what i was looking for on the mega_fancy_dress website , ordering was very slick and simple and delivery was extremly quick , very pleased with the costume will_definatly be ordering again from mega_fancy_dress as and when the occasion_arises :) .
neutral	they are eerily slow ' receiving ' returned discs if you return them before last post the following_day .
neutral	experience over phone and collection was faultless , however a child '_s army outfit lasted one day of wearing before it ripped apart at the sems .
negative	this was certainly not good enough for having the wrong sink and no waste_pipe and having to pay £_00 for another waste_pipe i was told that is how much they pay for there waste_pipe so they couldn_'_t give me anymore . ok this is understandable but for all the messing_around and mistakes i would certainly expect more than £_00 i was told i had only paid £_00 . 00 for the shower_tray and was spoken to like i should be greatful for £_00 .
neutral	much slower compared to the speedy 00hour courier from scan
neutral	ghd even repaired them eventually at very low_cost .
neutral	first time i used homebase website to place an order for my mum the website kept playing up , but the order went through i booked a date for the delivery and got my order acknowledgement .
positive	easy to deal on the website and the boxes arrived the next working day !
neutral	i think it was well over a week ( possibly two ) until my order did get dispatched which is comical considering their line ' over 00_% orders dispatched same day '.
positive	easy to use would use again
positive	i ordered from bulkpowders after_discovering that my usual_supplier adds gluten into the majority of their protein supplements , but doesn_'_t advertise the fact on their website ( which , as a celiac , is a tad inconvenient ).
negative	i complained about this .
neutral	will look again , but amex is a big thing as it also covers travel_insurance
neutral	i did not know at the time of booking that i was required to buy a whole tank of gas .

neutral	i cant find my phone model specification after 0 years later .
negative	after emailing them my dissatisfaction i was told " we do not have a resolution to your case ".
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be buying again .

neutral	finally arrived on the monday purchase --- exellent delivery ---- despicable !
positive	friendly site very easy to use .
positive	thanks a lot .
positive	very many_thanks .
negative	" trust " pilot had requested at_least three more people for documentation containing information about their purchases and their addresses and phone numbers !
negative	accordingly downrated from two stars to one star .
neutral	an extra_cost at the start of the holiday is not what you expect !
positive	always want a pair of oakley but they are far too expensive normally so i ’ ve never pull the trigger , that is until i stumble_across eyewear_outlet – bought the fast jacket with spare lenses , £_00 cheaper_than on high_street and duty_free , arrived next_day – can ’_t be_happier !
negative	! a lie .
negative	have a nice day .
positive	they don_'_t use the royal_mail as far as i '_m aware and that '_s why most of the time your items arrive on time .
positive	will_definately use again .
positive	i loved the sunday delivery and they guys who delivered were excellent .
positive	you can not fault this website for all your film info
positive	having looked around for quite a while for a small set of lights that were reasonably_priced , i eventually found some on festive_lights .
negative	to get through only to be told that the courier company closed at 0pm so no update would be available until the next_day .
negative	promised emails and calls never come_back .
neutral	i now have the product and delivery was accurate and timely . but i regret the dead time pending resolving the above mentioned issue .
neutral	it was a " large " bouquet and i would hated to have seen the small one !!
neutral	i am debating whether to return the item as quality is dubious .
neutral	i did this , but with some_confusion .
negative	never had such a disappointing experience as a customer .
neutral	not complaining just trying to be constructive .
positive	selection is easy on their website , you can enter your vehicle_registration to get your tyre size in case you are not sure .
positive	service is excellent , web - site easy to find your way around , there is no
negative	this is a bad company .
negative	" not on my computer mate , can '_t do it , you need to talk to head_office ", was all i got from the branch .
neutral	called to talk about a holiday i had seen online the member of staff was very rude saying that offer is unavailiable ' shock ' they never are he then said you either want it or you don_'_t simple as .
positive	cheap car_hire , great staff and great cars 0_star :-)
positive	would recommend .
neutral	i '_ve_used_tyreshopper a few_times now with excellent results , but on my most_recent order when my wife went to get them fitted they hadn_'_t had the tyres delivered . this put my wife '_s day out completely if you book a morning slot you expect them there , she arrived at 00am they still hadn_'_t been delivered at 00am .
positive	de service die roberto saveur aan mij verleend heeft is niets op aan te merken , en hij heeft niets anders dan zijn best gedaan .
negative	bravofly customer service : " i don_'_t know .
negative	i love my quinny_buzz well actually i used to love it now all i risk is harming my child every time i put her in it no refund offered no brand_new replacement only told there is nothing wrong with it .
negative	i have had a long conversation with both institutions and i have been given assurances that my complaint will be passed on to david pollock .
neutral	order was completed but packet had been opened that some point .
negative	don_'_t use opodo , it '_s a waste of your time .
positive	well_done merlin !
negative	very dissatisfied .
positive	will definitely use them again
positive	the smoothest , most efficient flower buying experience i have ever had .
positive	you can always trust higher_nature to deliver the goods very quickly and the service is excellent .
neutral	made payment , simple yes !, no !
negative	i contacted them again both my email and pgone and again was told that these had been posted - 0_days_later and getting really annoyed called again and was told that these would be sent by courier to arrive yesterday - guess_what stayed in all day - no courier .
positive	the villa has many plus points , it was spacious , clean and had everything you needed for a lovely holiday .
neutral	there were 0 lovely bakeries and adequate supermarkets not much more_expensive than the hypermarket which after 0 visit we didn_'_t bother with . there was a butcher which unfortunately was shut for holidays .
positive	i love my daily contacts , they fit really well and they were delivered very quickly
positive	everything_went_smoothly , they phoned me to confirm delivery details .
positive	i will be keeping an eye on the site though for anymore off the like that appear , as i just love the idea of having longer hair that i can tie up for my holidays .
positive	very chuffed .
neutral	great website and follow_up but on both_occasions i '_ve_used them the delivery was messed_up .
positive	my order was processed within the expected time scales & arrived when advised it would .
neutral	the length was very long - great for tall people but may need to be altered for those under 0 ' 0 " ( medium_size dress ).
negative	booket one week accommodation in rio_de janeiro through_expedia . co . uk .

neutral	there was no reply to my first email .
negative	i am not a charity and certainly do not work full - time to shore up this companies profits .
positive	excellent customer service and very nice people to deal with !
neutral	i '_ve had issues like this with dpd '_s " attempted deliveries " last christmas as well .
neutral	a sign says to ring a bell and someone will come .
negative	i went on to my account today to find they '_d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
neutral	if i could be_bothered to shop around , i ' d probably get a better deal .
positive	however , the young_lady i spoke to couldn_'_t have been more helpful , even phoning the courier to try and halt the delivery .
neutral	the bouquet was quite small and the flowers were not packed in a way which either helped them to stay fresh - they were looking quite limp after waiting a few hours to be presented as part of a leaving gift , or attractive - brown_paper inside plastic doesn_'_t look very nice .
negative	i will not recommend you to anyone - in fact quite the opposite would advise people to stay well clear .
neutral	i ordered on 00th_march at 0 . 00pm and only
positive	can '_t say better_than that .
neutral	** i order the mixed but they are mainly white , only 0 different colors in the pack .
positive	amazingly quick dispatch when i ordered at 0 pm , [ was delivered next_day before 0pm ]. certainly use again .
negative	there is no contact number on the whole website !
neutral	i found that very disappointing and will not use this service again .
neutral	the item was late to arrive and the ' free gifts ' were not included in the delivery due to being sold out .
neutral	there are other_websites that are just as good that don_'_t charge anything , like europe '_s famous hostels and hostelbookers .
negative	i assumed they had bulk bought some tickets , and that '_s why they were there .
positive	i have ordered sets of radiator_valves on two_seperate_occasions and have been highly delighted with both the quality and price of the items .
positive	arrived extremely quick with no_problems
negative	i don_'_t understand_why certain places offer collect_plus if they have no storage ?
neutral	i foundout from tracking service that it had been returned to depot , good job i checked in time to collect from sorting_office before weekend closure .
positive	i will_definitely use again and recommend to all .
positive	highly_recommend .
positive	( 0 ) easy to navigate web - site
positive	from ordering over the phone speaking to alf , to receipt of goods i have no_complaints , and would recommend animed to anyone .
positive	the price and delivery terms for my new shower_tray seemed really good .
neutral	animed delayed my order due to the otodex cream being out of stock , they should have refunded me straight_away for this item so that the cimicat kitten milk i also ordered could have been sent straight_away , i had to contact them a week_later to find out why my order still had not arrived , it was only then that they refunded me and sent the milk .
neutral	i ordered for my dog '_s medicine and every_month i get the same computer_generated email asking for the prescription , which of course they already have .
positive	thanks for the service
negative	don_'_t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
positive	everyone that moves house should use anyvan to get competitive quotes - it '_s such an easy system and a great concept !
negative	surely , you should actually investigate the matter ?
positive	got a fancy_dress party at the end of march , was , nt to keen at first until my better half got this web_site up , loads of choice at good prices , my roo came pretty quick and give us a laugh when i tried it on , there was plenty of information about deliver etc , give them a try
positive	look alot more_expensive that what we paid .
negative	i complained and the company agreed to give me a 00_%_discount , yet we are now around one month post - complaint and despite me phoning them in the mean time to ask what was happening , i am yet to receive any money .
positive	went over to the milton_keynes branch last_week .
positive	the goods were safely received the very next_day .
positive	peter j martin .
negative	after looking around and calling in what looked like a muddy field we decided not to leave our car here and proceeded to a " proper car_park "
positive	the parcel was collected promptly and delivered very quickly .
positive	felt i needed to get extra cover for things like collision_damage and all those things the normal car_hire insurance does not cover or charge silly money like € 00 a day .
neutral	ordered my makita leaf_blower on - line on evening of thursday 0th_nov , website easy to use , payment made via_paypal , so_far so good however no confirmation_email received that night .
negative	so now thanks to just eat i '_ve got money i can '_t spend until the bank release it maybe 00 working_days_later and no food , but i guess that '_s ok because " on behalf of just - eat we apologies for the inconvenience that this has caused you ."
neutral	my first order with this company , spent nearly_£_00 , prices good and order delivered promptly .
negative	i have a drive way leading up to a large double gate where 00_% of people take automatically as it is the obvious main used entrance to my home .
positive	if only all suppliers where like them
neutral	they were packed together in a single padded_envelope , rather_than a box , and i was sad to discover that the cardboard packaging for the knives themselves was badly flattened when i removed them from the envelope .
positive	simple , easy to navigate site .
negative	i could have got better for 0 . 00 at the co - op .
neutral	then , i get a call on the day of delivery that the driver had been waiting outside my house and could not wait any longer and had left .
positive	the driver checked cabinet and even put the handles on for me .
negative	stay_away they have loads of competitors you can use
negative	!
neutral	two things spoiled it : firstly , having chosen an agent where a " printer not necessary ", since i was asking for a parcel to be delivered to me , i was asked to print a label and stick it on the parcel !
positive	some delay in receiving the handles - a manufactuing problem i think .
negative	this is a company based in china .
positive	both items i ordered arrived together and within 00_hours of ordering .
positive	great can '_t ask for a better service
positive	emailed music_matter for a price on a new mike , received a quote almost_immediately , easily 00_%_cheaper_than elsewhere , collected an_hour later .
negative	when i called back i finally got some answers .
positive	double 0 are a reliable company that deliver what they say .
negative	after a very annoyed phone_call from me on friday 00th_january , i was assured that refund would leave argos account within 00_hours and into my bank within_00hours , here we are 0_days_later and still no refund .
positive	excellent price with fast delivery .
positive	very happy with the service and will_definitely use it again .

positive	excellent !
negative	few_days_later received a full_refund saying transaction had been cancelled .
positive	i wish all online_retailers were as fast .
negative	they said , and i quote , " it was a mistake ".
negative	all my emails were ignored , and i mean at_least 0 , in the end i was forced to post detrimental remarks on facebook , which they obviously monitor every day , instead of answering emails . it took 0 lots of nasty remarks before they magnanimously decided to send me the spuds , from the remarks onfacebook i wasnt the only one waiting .
neutral	i have been trying to source a ford_mondeo , and i was offered the details of four main_dealers with , give - or - take , the car i was seeking , but none of the four has actually been able to say if they actually have that car - or even if or when they will be able to obtain it .
negative	called hovells to check the website was correct and was told it was in stock .
positive	excellent easy website and delivery of product was perfect and on time
neutral	their turn_round is fairly quick and customer service helpfull .
positive	i won_'_t be shopping anywhere_else now !
positive	they provide you with regular_updates on your application and explain the process throughout .
neutral	i was informed on ordering that two items were out of stock and expected within 0_weeks .
neutral	although they looked ok they didn_'_t look like the picture i ordered from .
negative	i ordered a generator from this company , the website looked good and genuine .
neutral	three_weeks as_opposed to five .
neutral	if you need an mot you cant do better_than to use autotyres .
neutral	products great ., prices good , but use of independent delivery company means my last three deliveries have been thrown over my fence into my backgarden , damaging plants , and getting soaked in the rain !
negative	wife very happy .
negative	ordered the tyre , it came back via e_- mail as run_flat for a bmw , the legends at the side of the tyre have a bmw logo and rf , means nothing if no information about the product is not clear , the fact that it was for a mercedes might have given suplier a clue .
neutral	at £_00 against a product price of £_000 this was exorbitant .
neutral	expensive for what it is and for re - usability value
neutral	they stripped the threads on one of my wheel_nuts and did not even have a thread tap to repair it and thats only a few minutes work .
neutral	00th_january
neutral	will be more wary in future .
negative	she blamed the courier company for holding on to them , said there was nothing she could do but did i want to speak to someone_else in another department who was also customer service but that there were 0 people in the queue .
negative	however , even_though the website is a . co . uk website , these sunglasses have been shipped to me from hong_kong - which made me doubt my purchase straight_away .
neutral	however , although there is a disclaimer stating " our florists may substitute flowers and sundries for a suitable_alternative , similar in style , quality and value depending_on availability .
neutral	after a quick email to go_electrical they were very good and this time i had prompt delivery with a replacement which was wrapped in another box with packaging !
positive	best price i found and arrived when they said it would .
positive	gogodigital are a great company , service was brilliant , goods arrived promptly and very well_packaged , would recommend to anyone .
neutral	this company is becoming such a nuisance i recommend put it through the internet spam filter .
positive	superb service .
negative	talktalk could get_rid of them and replace them with machines , the end_result would be the same .
neutral	i am sure this all stems from the fact that they wait for your order , and take your money , before they source the product .
negative	amazon can deliver within two_days of ordering when paying for the same price delivery .
negative	you have all been_warned !
positive	item arrived very quickly and communication was good
positive	i ordered the part for my shower on the sunday , and it arrived on tuesday , which is excellent , considering i live in the highlands of scotland , and some firms charge exorbitant rates for delivery to my address .
positive	td0 00 defender 00 years past .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find it on viagogo .
negative	just to let you know i have still not heard_anything from iflorist in relation to my complaint .
negative	i '_ll go straight to the point .
negative	as i still want the tyre i ' d actually ordered i had to ask whether i could not just leave my order on and be contacted once they were available .
neutral	!
neutral	because the signs run out and you have to guess that you have to follow " authorised vehicles only ".
negative	arrived in faro on 0 / 00 / 00 after booking return transfer to olheo , at airport informed that the carrier would be greenbus .
negative	euros !
positive	had a small issue which was speedily sorted .
neutral	not as sharp as you ' d expect either , considering i went for the photo_paper .
neutral	i am very happy with the sales side of this company but not very impressed with the training i had never touched a nail before and was advised to do a sculpting course of which cost 000_pound this was around sep_0000 i have not even sent my first set of nails yet and have been on another nail_course and passed all my exams so i am now fully qualified but no thanks to essential_nails
positive	i recently wanted to purchase a new digital_slr - having look at all the reviews around i settled on a nikon_d0000 with an additional 00 - 000mm_lens .
negative	no amp .
negative	what a sorry_state of affairs .
neutral	there was just not enough buses in operation .
negative	i contacted santander customer service ( number provided by their online secure message ).
negative	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
neutral	my husband has thought that we might not bother again , as the plants we bought in the local_diy_store have been really good .

neutral	first transaction of 0 tickets , of which were £_00 in face value , a total of £_000 , i was charged £_000 . 00 .

negative	by the middle of the next_morning , having heard_nothing , i called the shop .
neutral	the chairs are excellent with clear assembly_instructions and each set of screws etc came with a spare .
negative	i said to him that i was not going to call them if it was a survey or something as i had already wasted enough time .
neutral	just want a better
neutral	i bought a nokia_lumia_000 in november_0000 and i am pleased with the phone and the deal .
neutral	they had removed all the inside keys so we could not lock the door between the pool room and the house which concerned me .
negative	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior_warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer service .
neutral	also , i know breakfast is served at the hotel but breakfast was not an option with trustpilot .
positive	~
neutral	the choice of layouts , background_colours etc was good and you can really personalise your book .
positive	the necklace came with a lovely box and certificate .
negative	what made it worse was i had to assemble it myself , not being a qualified florist you could imagine my frustration in my attempt to recreate the picture on the website .
neutral	having paid for the largest_bunch i expected there to be more flowers especially for the price , also received a different vase than i ordered
neutral	ordered a few_times .
negative	part from the price
neutral	i '_ve not had to shop through hmv that much and to be honest , i '_m quite happy of that fact .
negative	accommodation - not city_centre as advertised - it was central eastern berlin .
positive	communications were excellent from order acknowledgement to notification of despatch , i would recommend highly .
neutral	they may be a bit_slow , but they arrive in the end .
negative	i kept saying no but they constantly pester and try to force you to buy something .
negative	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
negative	aftr 00 days i informed wae_+ if i did not receive it within the next 0 days i would be contacting my credit_card company .
neutral	copying '& pastiing took_ages due to text boxes - one if them dropped the name if the hotel !
positive	very impressed with speed of delivery and price .
neutral	i will of course adjust the poor rating_accordingly to reflect the positive after sales experience when everything is completed .
neutral	expensive for returns .
neutral	if it is in stock , great .
positive	delivery fast and packaging superb .
positive	the goods arrived bang on time = happy customer ;-)
positive	tickets have always arrived in plenty of time and any_queries have been dealt_with promptly & professionally .
negative	' that '_s no good ' i said ' i need it up here ' sorry cant do that health and safety ' he said .
neutral	so i had to go directly to my vet and plead for some food to tide me over until my order arrived .
negative	yes their prices are cheap but so is the quality of their products .
neutral	couriers are , in my experience , put on this earth to make getting a parcel needlessly difficult .
positive	if you ' re looking for quality goods and excellent customer service , look no further than these_guys .
negative	ordered my locking_wheel_nuts on 0 / 0 /_0000 .
neutral	food was in poor condition !
neutral	we waited a hour for collection in auckland after ringing about 0 times - at no time did they say it was a different name of the rental_car that we had booked .
positive	!
negative	i will order another lovely bouquet but it '_ll have to be after easter now and with a different company .
negative	00th_january and still hadn_'_t heard_anything .
neutral	could not get through to customer_services just got pushy_sales people who wanted to set the deal up all over again , they couldnt understand_why i wanted to do it online although i explanined several_times i was in a hurry and had one small problem they just wouldnt transfer me , then when they finally connected me to customer_services it was just another sales_person !
neutral	i was impressed at the showroom , however now that i have had a few_weeks to really look at the furniture i notice that one of the doors on the sideboard is wonky and the dining_table has a very light streak along the centre .
negative	any domain you register ), pretty_much anywhere is better_than 000 - reg .
neutral	i had to make hasty arrangements to be at home all day the next_day ( luckily i have a flexible job but in many jobs that would be difficult ).
positive	very reliable speedy service , would defiantly use them again , live my specs
negative	i wasn_'_t too fussed about this as the price was good and the games were due out in 0_weeks , so not too long a wait .
neutral	i spoke to her on the phone and i asked if she had gotten anything nice today ( i didn_'_t want to spoil her_birthday surprise by telling her what to expect ).
neutral	poundland is cheap because everything is 0 pound but the reason i only put it three star is because of the quality of the products isnt that good but they have alot of things in store and good if you just need something quickly and dont have enough money
positive	it was easy to order , informed of its departure and arrived perfectly packaged .
positive	i like the idea of this product as i work_shifts where i need to eat my main_meal in a short amount of time .
negative	' availability ' email btw means no stock - and i believe they knew it when the order was taken on the website .
neutral	the job was subsequently left incomplete because we refused to pay the residue of the parts cost after the £_000 parts allowance was exceeded .
neutral	placed an order but my concern was that i was given no ' at the point of purchase ' information that 0 items were not in stock e . g .
neutral	i would appreciate if you could send me my 0000 € ( deposit ) back - after 0 days .
negative	i can only hope so !!!!
negative	very very disappointing .
neutral	rather_than abandon lenstore i did a search for a discount_voucher and discovered a new customer discount of 00_% i . e .

neutral	i am writing this while still on holiday having managed to use one so far and just hoping we will be able to spend the rest but they are viewed with suspicion in many places and were outrightly refused on our ferry to france .
neutral	if the item was out of stock then pozzani should not have accepted the order and it should have shown as out of stock on the web_site .
positive	very easy site to go through . lots of products and extra ideas to go with the costumes .

negative	would welcome their comments .
neutral	fortunately i never had to report a theft but my office was at the mercy of their security practices - a scary thought when they aren_'_t even able to take messages for me !

negative	awful .

negative	great i got a message_stating when i was getting my delivery .
negative	pay_peanuts , you get monkeys !

neutral	i forgot , the strawberry plants are going great guns .

positive	real live people in the uk !

negative	they really dont care and say that the most they can offer will be 00_%_off and really dont care that they are charging me for an item they mis_- sold !
neutral	0 . you do get a person at the other end of the line when you call in customer_care .
neutral	the plastic seems really though for my machine to pierce and a number of times the capsules haven_'_t burst through the foil so i then have to retrieve it and pierce it with a knife to get my cup of coffee
neutral	am now in the process of fitting the suite and all the items seem to be well made , they came with all the right fittings and full instructions , so no_complaints there .
negative	granted , they are all extremely young wines and pretty_much taste like vinegar next_day , but they are generally dull and tasteless - i wouldn_'_t even recommend them to the casual wine drinker .
negative	incidentally , i '_ve already discussed the matter with several journo contacts of mine , who are as equally concerned as i am about any accusations of bias and collusion .
negative	the idea of being_able to watch sky_tv on your laptop anywhere sounds_like a great idea right ?
positive	it '_s exactly as_described and good quality product .
negative	day 0 - thats today . still no parcel
positive	i wasn_'_t expecting the service to be quite so fast and efficient , i was duly impressed when my parcel arrived within two_days
positive	one concern i have is the extra_insurance costs you have to pay .
neutral	( no other airport_parking does that to my knowledge .)
positive	cannot recommend highly_enough .
negative	when there are many of us slowly eliminating facebook from our_lives , besides that what about the endless amounts of fake promotional profiles as i like to call them ,
neutral	nope , if you buy online they must go back to bedeck ireland .
positive	submitted the details on line , paperwork arrived the next_day and phone sent off same day .
positive	we were slightly_nervous as we had read some mixed_reviews on tripadvisor , but we cannot_fault the service in anyway and better_than the parking provided by the cruise line .
positive	straightforward purchases , fast sending of information !
neutral	apart_from the niggles , all good .
positive	cheers .
neutral	delivery is also free for orders over £_00 . 00 .
negative	i received a response back stating that i would receive a reply in 0_days .

positive	thanks for the response and the new cartridges .
negative	it did arrive , but they had sent 0 top parts , the reason i knew this was because the bottom part should have had a draw - no drawer present .
negative	!
negative	terrible company .
negative	i would rather spend my hard working money on a company that values it '_s customers all the way through , not to get an order and then not give a toss .
negative	kennel delivered on the tuesday .
negative	update_:
neutral	00days now since i paid for a cordlees drill battery .
neutral	we have given up on the courier company .
neutral	time estmates for payout tend to be somewhat over - optimistic .
positive	when the crank pulley turned_out to have been incorrectly manufactured ( not wanapart '_s fault ) they couldn_'_t have been more helpful , sourcing a replacement from an_alternative supplier in germany which would have been on my doorstep within 00_hours of my informing them of the issue but for the courier mis_- delivering the item .
negative	still_awaiting a refund really not happy
positive	as usual with this particular driver , the parcel arrived near the beginning of the appointed hour and the driver was extremely pleasant and friendly .
neutral	my husband and i are desperately_trying to put it down as a bad_experience , and are trying to just forget about the villa .
neutral	why didn_'_t you tell me that i had to order a separate wireless card to make this thing work ?
neutral	the quality of the flowers was good though
negative	viovet should send this 0 tiny item separately - it isn_'_t my fault this item is out of stock .
positive	would certainly tell anyone to go to them first and will not_hesitate in using them again .
neutral	warning - give yourself plenty of time before actually wanting the hair in case they mess up !
neutral	i would say give gumtree a go within the free listings , and if no cigar consider other options before paying .
neutral	what you have to watch though is the ' helpful ' emails and telephone_calls all of which are designed to sell you something extra .
positive	ordered at 0 . 00am arrived next_day at 00 . 00am !
negative	its awful !
positive	such a fantastic website .
neutral	in a gleeful tone .
neutral	also the cabinet we ordered was nearly left on the van and i had to remind the driver who were helpful .
neutral	some of the offers on the internet dont work and i ended_up cancelling some of my order .
negative	hotel_rooms
negative	had a booking in barcelona for about 0_months , and had been arranging check in with the host .
neutral	next_day we received a further text saying it wasn_'_t to be delivered and to ring them to rearrange a further delivery slot .
positive	some make you post your prescription resulting in a significant time delay .
negative	rip_off .
neutral	to charge extra for slightly faster processing is not good business practice .
neutral	i know this is a small company , but as i ordered online on christmas day , although i got a confirmation_email automatically , the item didn_'_t get posted until 0th_january as the owner had been away for a few_days
positive	everything '_s set out clearly on their website , including prices , and they offer reductions for multiple_buys .
positive	wish i had found this site before as it would have saved me a lot of money from paying exhorbitant excess charges at airport car_hire firms .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	they refused and waffled on about why .
positive	would use again .
positive	from ordering ( very easy website ) to having the paints delivered was just a few_days .
neutral	it is very democratic that everyone has an input but not everyone has the same standards .
positive	if you want one of the best products at a reasonable rate , and full after sales support , then do yourself a favor , look no further !!!!!!
neutral	although i like the offer and pictures of the b_& b '_s , i find it hard that you can '_t see whether there is a vacation or not .
negative	should have come here first , yet another person to suffer the alledged water_damage , amazing eh_?
positive	as a bit of a " pen geek " cultpens is ticks_all the boxes .
neutral	0 .
positive	the service and speed with which the order was handled was second to none , and i won_'_t_hesitate to use them again when the need_arises .
negative	but there is no way i '_m waiting for 0_weeks . i '_m getting very angry !!!!!!!
positive	can '_t fault the service .
neutral	it was just a nuisance not being_able to order a hamper and flowers on the same order .
positive	delivery was very speedy .
positive	i do most of my non - grocery_shopping online , and have earned_hundreds of £££ by clicking_through_topcashback .
neutral	time will tell how they really are .
neutral	i used national_tyres for fitting .
neutral	my first experience with watchfinder was excellent with an immaculate rolex daydate sold to me as quoted , no_complaints and a lovely new model .
negative	i have now resorted to opening a paypal claim ( i am glad i paid by paypal ) and they have not yet responded to anything paypal have sent them so hopeful i will receive a refund .
neutral	selling used goods as new ?
positive	simple , great value , definitely use again !
neutral	initial review see below
neutral	i ordered the biggest bunch available & what i got looked like the standard size advertised on the website .
neutral	the food was nice , a good portion but some of the flavours we a bit bland so i added spice / herbs to balance the existing flavours .
neutral	no_surprises this christmas , i sent them an_email to say i wasn_'_t happy about what they had done , no response forthcoming .
negative	then the parcel just disappeared & i thought that i would be making a claim .
positive	ordered monday , delivered thursday .
positive	an ideal_location if you want the ambiance of the city life as we did .
negative	basically outlook kept_crashing the system making the laptop essentially unusable for a small business owner - previous to the call i had spent 0 full days on calls with microsoft tech_support who said it was the machine .
neutral	really disappointed and rather cross as i am paying more for the three_days in the long_stay car_park in may than i am for parking a week in june in the silver_zone car_park !
neutral	i went in on a saturday and handed it in and paid the £_00 to get it done quickly ( i am a student and needed it for work ).
neutral	i bought my aviva home insurance through_quidco and saved_myself quite a bit of money on the policy cost but the cash_back amount stated was £_00 . 00 and i '_ve ended_up getting £_00 . 00 .
negative	i '_m very angry at this time , actually it has never happened before with the other orders , don_'_t know if i have to blame interlink_express but for three_times i recieve a email with " we tried to deliver your order from affordable_supplements limited however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below "!
neutral	you get where you want to in the end .
neutral	the business lounge was very bland .
neutral	the pair were for me , a saving of 00_% from the high_street .
neutral	not that the flowers were bad , the opposite infact , very beautyful .
positive	and they phoned up to check the details on my prescription when something didn_'_t look quite right .
negative	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
positive	!
negative	and all the rest of it .!!
negative	my advice would be steer_clear !!!
positive	excellent quality products and the sunglasses were probably my favourite part !
neutral	all items can be tracked online .
negative	will post again if i hear_anything , positive or negative .
negative	i explained i '_ve already paid for my eletcricity . i '_m not paying for it twice .
neutral	!
neutral	maybe they should look at a new haulage contractor .

neutral	especially when i was in pain .
neutral	order was dispatched by you 00th_dec now 00th_dec
positive	fast delivery .
positive	the shop i visited in epsom was just perfect it had staff which went through and beyond to help me with any questions i had .
neutral	the shoe storage struggled to occomodate size eight shoes and some wouldn_'_t fit at all unless placed at an angle on the shelf , if put straight the door doesn_'_t close properly .
positive	i got them on 00_% so thought the quality wouldn_'_t be as good .
negative	four people give them five_stars .
neutral	la concurrence est en place ex auto escape a d ' aussi bons tarifs , les 0 dernières locations je les ai faites chez eux car les tarifs avec_des loueurs premium ( avis europcar , sixt .)
negative	this time i get a verbal apology from a manager at ccl and i am informed a new pc is being built for me .
positive	the best i know of so far .
neutral	you have suggested various_options which will provide a better service .
neutral	however have tried_phoning their medical_screening ( 0000 number ) held on for 0 mins then they offer ringback ' without losing place in queue '.
neutral	0a .
negative	but once we got onto the bus it all went down from there .
neutral	james h
neutral	i bought an item as a gift , although the product itself was great the packaging supplied to gift_wrap it was disappointing .
negative	endless emails chasing the item and a threat to report the md to trading_standards ( i found his_name on companies house ) - as well as raising a paypal_dispute , resulted_in me actually receiving my item .
negative	complained to head_office as ordered a cardigan size 00 .
negative	thanks a bunch .
positive	we wanted to go and see a show in london and wanted a good deal with both a hotel and show .
negative	clearly not a proper one .
positive	our neighbour has reported to us he does it constantly !
neutral	good online shop , used a few_times , but last time i needed to know some information about a product , that wasn_'_t clear on the website .
positive	i found the website great to use as i got what i wanted straight_away
neutral	the company and the service is brilliant .
negative	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
positive	excellent service , we phoned when we were about 00_minutes from gatwick_airport and the driver was there waiting to take the car .
neutral	but - on driving 000_miles on the m00 and m0 , i noticed the balance wasn_'_t right .
neutral	potential_clients would need to be reasonably fit to negotiate steep stairs to upper sections of the hotel .
neutral	only one member of staff in office , so had to wait_until he was free .
negative	i '_ve been charged every_month for a sim i never received or used totaling_£_00 . 00 .
positive	brilliant .
neutral	some stuff is really good value and it is convenient to find a lot of things in one store but recently there have been some changes afoot in our local_store .
positive	mark donaldson responded promptly with any_queries and difficulties and " did what he said he would "!
positive	don_'_t think i '_ve ever had better service .
positive	the information required was simple and straight_forward .
negative	i hope this review helps to improve matters .
positive	first_tutors is an easy to use website , matching tutors to tutees .
positive	but thank_you for the first_class service higher_nature .
neutral	replacement was sent and instead of courier delivery ( which would have been unnecessary ) i opted for a free bow_tie , but was a little disappointed that the free bow_tie was black when the shirt i ordered was also black .
positive	espares do show you the back of the knob part but it was difficult to tell which way was up so to speak .
negative	i have spoke to other shops on the high_street at 00 bute street & also 0 station rd radyr cardiff a returns address they use and not one person has heard of so special .
positive	will be coming_back for more ;-)
neutral	despite checking their ' tracking ' website there were no more updates and it was wednesday_lunchtime before my delivery arrived .
negative	this is the worst service i have * ever * received from any online company in 00 years of internet ordering .
negative	in the end my sister got so fed_up that she cancelled everything , despite them saying that they wouldn_'_t give her any money back .
negative	complete_waste of time £_00 doesn_'_t even cover the original carriage_charge .
negative	i fitted the new belt this week and it was cutting fine , until one of the blades broke !
neutral	folllowing a puncture the car was changed rather_than a new tyre fitted .
negative	my money was refunded in a couple of days and the company didn_'_t_argue against the dispute i had raised .
positive	very good prices .
negative	as it was taken out of the packaging .
neutral	our return was delayed and we eventually left the ship - after another rocky return trip at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	.
neutral	it is driving me mad and i have asked them to sort it but they have not yet done this which has caused me to rate mazuma not as good as a wanted to !
positive	the complimentary pillows are really comfortable too .
negative	it transpires the postcode for **** on your website is wrong rm0 @@@ it should be rm0 +++ and my tyres have been delivered to an unknown location !
positive	i was nervous_about buying a grey_import from other_suppliers , so this was a perfect compromise .
negative	phone has now run out of batteries .
positive	if you want to impress your friends at christmas with the ultimate cocktails and you can '_t find want you need in the shops , you will find it on the drinkshop website .
negative	sent in phone
positive	the gears need s little bedding in but that '_s to be expected .
neutral	for that reason i won_'_t be using viagogo again
negative	we have hundreds of deliveries every day .
positive	they also collected the old unit but did not take the packaging from the new one .
negative	no safe , dirt all around , no en suit facilities - had to share communal bathroom .
positive	got to have a look on the superdry website
neutral	if the deal i '_ve paid for comes with champagne i expect champagne not sparkling_wine .
neutral	however i had opted and paid for delivery before_noon and was hoping that the sympathy_flowers would arrive before the couple had to leave for her mum '_s funeral at 00 . 00am .
neutral	apart_from that they were ok
negative	btw , i already forgot about the bike . uffff
negative	the vase you delivered was not the vase i ordered the vase i ordered was black the vase you sent was clear why
negative	yes , there are plenty of good reviews but the after sales service leaves a lot to be desired .
positive	really pleased with this table .
negative	again there was no explanation .
negative	this was the 0_star_review , which is now downgraded to 0_star , see far below .
positive	can really feel a difference after only short while .
positive	the reward_scheme is also great .
positive	first time i had purchased glasses online
neutral	i booked villa , flights and transfers with them .
neutral	the constant aim to use the fuel one has already paid for is neither very relaxing nor is it environmentally_friendly ( one ends up driving around just to burn fuel ).
neutral	hotel was spotlessly_clean .
negative	there is also a show which you can pay extra for - myself and my partner were almost forced to pay an extortionate_amount for this show , which my partner and i refused to pay .
negative	i know that you are aware , understand and agree to all charges , conditions and operating practices of the car_hire_companies .
positive	can you ask for more
positive	as always the service and delivery are excellent and prices second to none
positive	kept_informed every_step of the way by email and text .
positive	the goods came within_00hrs and were exactly as_described .
positive	easy to fold and unfold and very easy to move_around .
neutral	i didn_'_t like at all how clumsy and difficult it was to cancel .
positive	i '_ll definitely be a return customer and would recommend bella_barista to a friend .
positive	i will recommend glasses_direct to anyone who really care how they and need not pay a fortune .
positive	quick delivery .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use this firm again because of the substitutions .
neutral	a subsequent delivery date was also not met , and i am still_awaiting delivery of it .
negative	do yourself a favour and stay clear of this scam and rip_off website , i '_ll be cancelling my membership as soon as possible and chalk it up to a lesson_learned .
negative	not only that but they look half the size and half as ' alive ' as the websites photo . and they werent cheap either !
neutral	we took a shuttle_bus from the airport hotel to terminal 0 , via terminal 0 .
neutral	however , they dont move_around and look pretty_damn smart - so not a problem .
neutral	the delivery was pretty unsatisfactory - expensive at £ 0 . 00 and slow , took about 0_days to arrive .
neutral	i would love to give the brushes a second chance but i would rather bit risk leaving an unhappy client .
positive	would certainly reccommend .
negative	i have used their online customer service application and after four working_days i have hear nothing even_though they say they will always reply in two_days max .
neutral	i found myself hoovering a lot as i was concerned .
neutral	after long_queues and many phone_calls home i managed to retrieve details from family who logged_onto may email at home .
neutral	on return sadly a different_story as we had to wait 00_minutes for pick_up in wet cold and windy_weather .
negative	i had been mis_- sold the deal and contacted orange to cancel the switch .
positive	visits store , great
positive	very prompt delivery , with option to switch day .
positive	0x dunlop_sport maxx rt 000 / 00zr00
negative	i have to say this is not the first time this has happened to me and it appears that the collection of parcels are far more important than the actual delivery of them thus being if they run_out of time on the day by collecting the parcels they just simply won_'_t deliver them .
positive	:_d
neutral	i did not find the service comparable to other online_retailers i have used who keep their customers informed .
negative	i have not received any acknowledgement of receipt from you .
positive	brilliant service with bagdirect . com . will_defo be shopping with them again . well chuffed !!
negative	i think he would have been a manager or supervisor but i cannot be sure .
neutral	not really that helpful and it was a bit like pulling_teeth .
negative	this is why we suggest all our buyers to reject the invoice , if the work is not completed .
neutral	a lovely arrangement of flowers but not very good value for money
neutral	but if the site says they '_ve got the tyres and takes your money , it '_s not very good when they later say , " whoops !
positive	i had for a long time desired a compact but powerful laptop .
neutral	there seemed to long_periods of inactivity apparently due to lack of response from the other party '_s insurance .
negative	!
negative	we switched to talktalk a month_ago because of the huge bills from bt .
neutral	arrived when they were meant to
negative	i was horrified , as i had actually bought them back within 0 hours of purchasing them , and the ' dirt ' he was referring too was the glue on the bottoms of the soles which were peeling slightly .
negative	( lord only knows what she would have got if i hadn_'_t paid the max ) as to the chocolates , they didn_'_t have them so got one mixed box from another store !!
neutral	i order a monthly repeat of a private_prescription , and the prescripton is on file .
negative	when i queried it i was told a delivery attempt was made but your florist got no answer .
neutral	also i was disappointed that my details hadn_'_t been put on the card so my recipient had no idea who the flowers were from !
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt on 00 / 00 /_0000
positive	i rang the company and was able to send the lady an email and then order the goods over the phone .
neutral	no apology !
neutral	cookie was undercooked and coke tasted like carbonated water coloured brown .
neutral	there was plenty of credit on it so no poblem with cash shortage .
neutral	however , there were a couple of issues that i came_across after the sale that left me a bit disappointed .
neutral	returning the car was tricky as the office was unattended at 0am despite the hours being stated as opening at 0 . 00 .
neutral	my advice would be to make_sure you leave ample time when ordering foods etc .
negative	i have suffered bad customer service in the past , however not on this scale when literally being with a company for 0 months .
negative	!
neutral	they rely_on their global brand to create the impression of trust and use deceptive and misleading sales_tactics to lure you into a false_sense of security .
positive	the hard_disk drives that i ordered arrived on time and the packaging was excellent , both drives being packed separately in foam .
positive	keep_up the great work .
positive	can '_t expect any better_than that .
negative	it will be my next review on trust_pilot , heres_hoping its a better service than the shameful one wiggle offer .
neutral	however , after another email to nicecans , they replied_saying they were very sorry and that they '_d been overwhelmed with how many orders they '_d got and they were really sorry that they hadn_'_t got in touch before .
negative	did their managers not come into work ?
neutral	for the second order the same information freeze happened but when i called it seems the poles had been sent to the wrong place and no one had noticed .
negative	i ordered a book , which took an age .
negative	i then communicated via chat again on the 0th asking where they were .
positive	had to return a christmas_tree to santas elves in the nederlands but got very confused with their postal adress .
neutral	i would have lost a good chunck of the money i paid for the items , when there is a bedeck shop only 00_minutes drive from me , so simple to return items there .
neutral	on this occasion they didnt have the pressure_washer that i originally ordered as it was discontinued so i had to order a more_expensive product .
positive	great quality , prompt delivery , much_easier and cheaper then printing photos and personally putting them in an album .
positive	came to my workplace bob on time .
positive	delivery company provided regular_updates including a call an_hour before they arrived .
neutral	it is good at picking uphair and bits .
positive	also people were asking where i had got it , so happily recommended escapade .
positive	everything from the secure_packaging to being updated on delivery status was first_class .
neutral	moral of my post – read the delivery instructions properly !!
positive	if you are at all concerned or nervous of making a purchase in that you havn '_t seen the article in the flesh , you have a money back guarantee with no strings_attached
neutral	just annoys the customer !
negative	so i '_m just waiting it out .
positive	they deliver on time and you should check them out .
neutral	i placed an order several weeks_ago and it is still outstanding .

positive	would strongly_recommend .
negative	i have finally_managed to get them to agree that a manager chloe will call me tomorrow but i need to get this parcel collected by someone_who is capable of ringing a doorbell .

negative	my advice , stay well clear of this ( at best ) incompetent company !
positive	i would recommend them to anyone who needs health advice .

negative	stressed this was a christmas_present and the recipient would be leaving the country on the sunday - was told this would not be a problem .
positive	so pleased we use this service taken the pressure off having to remember repeat_prescriptions ,
neutral	also as jessops stores have / are closing , you now have to pay postage and packaging , which adds to the overall cost .
negative	0 ) all defects other than broken chair were acceptable

neutral	first delivery was fine .
neutral	it was 0 . 00 for a small 0st_class stamp and a ain white envelope , nearly as much as the key !
negative	i have since heard that they recycle under the name " zoverstock " on amazon . daylight_robbery in my opinion .
negative	recommend to others ?.
neutral	there was no card left and the recipient did think it was rubbish until he picked it up .
neutral	had 0 wait 0 hour '_s 0 have 0 tyre fitted !!!
positive	was given a 0 hour_window in which the delivery would take place which was stuck to .
positive	their bacon and ham are the best we have tasted in recent years .
positive	they have such a large range to choose from and the orders are sent out so quickly .
neutral	my only irritation is that i registered as part the ordering_process , ordered and then photoworld sent me a welcome email to say i could get a £_00 discount on my first book .
neutral	we also did not recieve proofs of our art_work until chased for over a week after order had been placed , and never received the swatch of the stitching .
neutral	to have been offered the book at reduced cost would have been a start - lets_face it from their point of view it will go in the bin !
positive	i then received an e_- mail the following_monday informing_me my item would be delivered on a certain_date and requested someone to be in the house to sign for it and that if i looked at this e_- mail the following_day then it would show an_approximate_time for the delivery .
positive	the quality on offer while being affordable and tons better_than the likes of b_& q and suited our rooms very well .

positive	i have a standing order which always_arrives in plenty of time , had to make an adjustment recently & it was dealt_with right away without_any hassle .

neutral	- aucune adresse mail indiquée sur_le site .
neutral	and i would still recommend them .
negative	which it is not .
positive	simply the best company i have used
neutral	bought a lot from you in the past and have been very pleased with the products , delivery and customer service .
neutral	but when i called to enquire_about a product they took the information and said they would call me back , i was never called back .
positive	simply_supplements have a good range of products and their prices prove to be very good value .
neutral	the items themselves operate ok so not worth the hassle of returning .
neutral	i added some products which showed " as added " but never got included and only after you pay the money , you realise what you bought .
positive	i won_'_t be buying from anyone_else 0_*
negative	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling_regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
negative	ordered flowers they use yodel courier , never arrived on day promised . then receive arrogant call from customer_services can say can arrive up to 0pm that night , will reclaim from from card provider , definately not recommended , avoid plenty of other great websites ?
neutral	had i know , i would have thought twice about ordering them in the first place .

positive	tooled_- up . com offered us plenty of choice and had the exact one we were looking for .
negative	i should have just demanded my money back and forgot about the whole ordeal , but i did not want to inconvenience my friends !
neutral	one lady asked could she enter the store to browse through the cetology as she was not sure what present she wanted to purchase , rodger the deputy store manager said no , even_though the store contained a number of customers doing just that !
negative	but they were very vague on the delivery time therefore i cancelled my order and had the money refunded to me that day .
negative	the other two were no shows .
neutral	it just seems like they completely forgot about it as there '_s no reason_why a prescription should take that long to source ( it only takes a couple of minutes ).
positive	thank - you for restoring my faith in a pleasant shopping_experience & excellent service .
negative	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .

neutral	driver told us they can '_t even go up steps , leaving us with hundreds of kilos of tiles on the floor outside our apartment building .
negative	total_waste of money .
neutral	customer service really is 0_star , all the staff are very helpful and courteous , however i have only given it 0_star due to the problems i had with my order and it being out of stock and the amount of money i have spent on hone calls £_00 which i am very annoyed about .
neutral	whilst i was told that i would suffer some discomfort after my procedure it was not conveyed to me just how painful the first week post surgery would be .
positive	i will shop again with you !
negative	more than a month has passed and went back to the shop , showed the text_message to a member of staff and after checking they said they never received the bill and that it was too late to process it again as it had to be done exactly after 0_months .
negative	he was aggressive in a passive way refusing to answer any of my questions and not even looking at me .
positive	the site was recommended to me .
neutral	i was sent an ' order dispatched ' email when in actual fact , this wasn_'_t the case - they were out of stock .
positive	i ordered my cat_food after being told by a friend that it would be a lot_cheaper .
negative	firtsly , i realised i had made a mistake on the message , e_- mailed interfflora within minutes of the purchase to ask if the message could be rectified ( there was an extra letter at the end of a name ) and was told this wasn_'_t possible even_though the flowers and message were to be delivered in a week '_s time .

neutral	jeg_vil til enhver tid advare venner , der ønsker at_bestille varer hos nelly .
neutral	excellent product , the first order did not arrive although the courier had claimed the driver had been and left a card at the address .
neutral	it is unfair that late charge fees are put on to the account even if you are 0 day late .
neutral	box 0 finally arrived on saturday .
negative	as far as postage and packing goes there where no_problems , well_packaged and arrived before expected , the problem was that the item ( a synthesizer module ) was described on the website as obviously second_hand but there was no mention of any_problems with it , basically used but in full working order , turns_out the the headphone output was only working on one channel , volume knob was not original ( not that bad i admit ) main data selector knob was missing with just the shaft exposed , fare enough it could still work with a new cap fitted but this selector knob its self required for all essential functions was completely_useless as it didn_'_t actually work meaning the device was un usable , luckily i fix things like this if they are not to hard to sort so decided to do so , having the correct knowledge and tools i managed to get most of ot working apart_from the headphone_socket , one resistor broken in half , anyway after a few hours of work that i didn_'_t expect i had it up and running and sent an email back to cash_generator in manchester complaining that they had sold a completely faulty item as a fully working item and predictably they just ignored the email of complaint , i suppose i should have gone_through the hassle of sending it all back for a refund but i wanted it to work so i could use it but beware buying from this place as they obviously don_'_t give a crap about what they sell and don_'_t even check the functionality of the things they sell and just sel as fully working , and also ignore any correspondence , beware !
negative	i selected a saddle based on the information sent , it was termed long_distance saddle , which it clearly isn_'_t , when fed back to the shop my level of disapointment surprise_surprise they happen to use that very one and its remarkbly comfortable and they suddenly can find no mention of it being a long_distance saddle .

positive	good prices , free_p_&_p_& fast delivery .
positive	he provided all the information i needed , answered questions some possibly not often asked , gave advice and was generally very pleasant to talk to .
negative	i have the receipt from the postoffice .
neutral	broadband_speed rating found talk_talk slower_than virgin_media but much much_cheaper and easier to understand billing process having been with virgin for a number of years desided to swap as virgin was getting very expensive to use .
negative	we ordered from decuisine over a month_ago .
negative	i ordered a gift that i thought was costing me 000 . 00 and it ended_up costing $_000 .

positive	thanks for all your help and support in enabling_us to get exactly_what we needed at competitive_prices .
neutral	the delivery was not secured anywhere .
neutral	they made a big deal about their "£ 00 for our 00 - week plan " offer .
neutral	just improve the paint_brush !
negative	most normal people will not be international peps , therefore if the creditsafe system is going to check against the pep register it needs to find a way of fine - tuning the matching process more closely - perhaps exact name match and dob - otherwise this enhanced check is just creating more of a hindrance than help to its users .
positive	brilliant service would recommend them anytime
negative	how on earth is not a proper phone system to taken calls ?
negative	on top of that , i '_ve recently made a claim for an item sent with insurance that has_been damaged in transit .

negative	i was advised that there would be a faint line on the bifocal lenses .
negative	can '_t get any response from then .
negative	!
negative	i feel_conned by this company because even_though their invoice clearly_states that i have been charged for design according to them this only means i have rented the design and cannot use it again without paying for it again .
negative	i was told that was ofl procedure .
positive	would definitely use them again and would not_hesitate to recommend them , brilliant .
negative	after several more calls i was told that they would try and get the parts sent by special delivery for the thursday this did not happen .
neutral	placed my order from tribal six days ago , gives a . co . uk web address .
neutral	most sites are able to deliver items within a couple of days , items take about a week to be delivered on rubbersole which is poor .

neutral	by the following_day ( thursday ) the products still hadnt arrived , as i was on the phone to function 00 the goods did thankfully arrive but the gentleman on the phone as helpful and polite as he was claimed that because i live in the north of scotland ( aberdeen ) nect day delivery wasnt always an option .
positive	good value as well .
negative	it was not delivered on first request .
neutral	the service was quick and efficient and delivered on time however the helium_gas_cylinder ran_out before all the balloons that came in the pack were filled and the latex balloons didn_'_t float very well despite following all the instructions with regards to size etc .
positive	we were quoted a price at the local_pharmacy .
negative	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
negative	eventually it turned_out i was more stubborn than him and his sales_pitch ( although he insisted he wasn_'_t from the sales_team and i was the only costumer who '_d ever been offered this amazing deal ) and he finally agreed to give me my pac_code so i could end my contract and take my number with me .
positive	easy ordering , fast response , tickets received within the week , good price .
negative	my advice to serenata ?. dump yodal as couriers .
neutral	each extra transaction attracts a charge upon tesco from the card_issuer so they actually ended_up making less money than they would have done if they didn_'_t have the silly rule in the first place !

neutral	as a buyer i have difficulty in recognising which product might be right for my particular needs .
positive	if like me you are self - employed and googled " annuity " when nearing retirement , then you would have found a bewildering choice of companies promising the earth .
neutral	i was not prepared to risk going through the same again as it was not clear whether it was me or ecco that made the mistake , so went into one of their shops and bought size 00 .
positive	i think lastminute . com not only have some awesome deals , but they are really helpful on the other end of the phone .
negative	i ordered and paid but there was still no option to book the delivery slot .
negative	complete amateurs and lazy to boot .
negative	it may seem like a good deal on the cover .
negative	0 seconds after_submitting my order i wanted to amend the card i had selected as i realised it was totally_inappropriate .
negative	no one trying to run a small business and paying through the nose for slow broadband should have to deal with amateurs who can '_t pass simple customer status flags from contracts to accounts , and continuously charge for services not rendered due to incompetence / record overpromising .
negative	as i hire_cars when i go away , i will never , ever consider_using this company again and i will tell as many people as possible to do the same .

neutral	dear dino_pc
neutral	good service , but not a great range of selections for my industry type ( solid fuel ) but have to give them a bit of leeway due to the fact that it is a niche_market .
negative	when i picked_up my phone got a page telling_me what had been done to repair it and all that had happened was that they had reset it .
neutral	i had stupidly ordered a couple of hours too early .

negative	we received a request from a site owner to reconsider [ website ] for compliance with google '_s webmaster guidelines .

negative	i checked my order on the wed only to find the delivery date had been put back 0_days with no notification .
negative	usually very good indeed , but my recent_purchase of a pair of gloves - to replace another pair of morlands gloves stupidly lost have been a real disappointment : much less substantial than the other [ two year_old ] pair , and already the stitching is coming_undone and already the leather is torn - through no unusual wear .
neutral	lovely flowers , but i will go into a local_florist next time so i had a better idea of what i was actually getting for my money .
positive	they looked great as well .
neutral	a great product but no instructions , invoice or return details if the product was faulty or not suitable was enclosed with the product , so very poor customer service .

neutral	i found this both helpful and informative .
positive	fast shipping , great , fast helpfull communication .
negative	we accepted a quote for a house removal , and paid a deposit of over £_000 , our chosen courier did not contact us , when we contacted him , he said he was sorry but he had a lot on .
negative	the flowers were left_outside of the upstairs flat .
neutral	won_'_t put me off future_purchases , i '_ll just stick to the standard delivery though .
neutral	- ordered 0 june
neutral	a lot of the stores don_'_t have a dedicated collection desk so you end up having to queue at a normal till only to be told that they are too busy and you should go to a different department .
negative	got tv broad band could not get any extra channels rang up had rude manger i put phone down and she kept ring back next_day i rang talk_talk and asked them if i could cancel my package i got put thorgh to a contact center abroad he was nasty rude he told me he had my bank deatailes and could any thing he wants and i cant stop him had to close my account what twats they are

neutral	how on earth it takes anyone 0 days to deliver a package from england to northern_ireland in 0000 is anybodies guess !!
neutral	sweatband gave_me a partial_refund , and didn_'_t cover the cost of my return postage .
negative	the sale went through on viagogo and money taken out from paypal so seemed fine , but when i went to download and print the tickets they were unavailable .
negative	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
positive	everything worked_perfectly straight out of the box , pretty minimal setting_up required and we were ready to fly within an_hour or so .
positive	took 0 . 0 days to unlock and was worth the wait , i thought it would of tool longer !
positive	the price match is phenomenal and the free and discounted products with your purchases make it so there is no doubt in my mind that i '_m getting the best deal when i am cashing out my supplements .
negative	the trim did not arrive until tues . 00 / 0 / 00 and was damaged .
negative	in my opinion they '_ve stolen the money from me because they charged a premium for their so - called saturday_morning delivery .

neutral	i contacted the customer_services to see if they could contact the driver to determine what time he would arrive .

positive	as i didn_'_t pay much for the frames i decided to give them a go and so glad i did .
positive	could print_off own_labels to make it quicker
negative	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don_'_t leave a card when attempting delivery , it '_s like they expect us to be mind readers !
negative	terrible people .
neutral	however on insisting on a 0 door the staff magically produce a 0 four door polo .
positive	they both came after 0 days .
negative	i can understand that you feel you have lost out , but we were not in a position to finance the business anymore .
neutral	great product and price , although i they would have helped my wife ( home on her own ) bring in the products in doors .
negative	i smelt a rat when they asked for my bank details .
positive	website was very easy to navigate , found my phone with no_problems and the price was shown before i had to register any details .
neutral	on turning_up at the kiosk booth on departure day , we were asked if we would like to book any meals on board for the trip .
negative	i contacted them on saturday to double_check they had been delivered and they told me they had .
positive	from website , to ordering , to delivery , to assembly everything was first_rate .
neutral	i took my car in the next_day at 0am and was told to pick it up at 0pm .
neutral	i was checking several dates for the prices and left the wrong date when i booked .
negative	the replacement card was faulty , failed under load which seemed to be a known fault from looking on random forums ( amd 0000 ).
positive	buyabattery '_s stock is comprehensive and well indexed .
positive	i only wanted flowers but there was an interesting variety of extras , such as vases , chocolates etc that were available .
positive	i would recommend refresh_cartridges and i will definitely use them again .
negative	i rang swansea on the 00 july was told sorry it will be 0_weeks and yet car_reg told me at_least 0 to 00 days .
negative	the customer_services representative i spoke to each time was rude and unhelpful .
neutral	if musclefoods gets these right then there '_s a potential future regular customer here .
negative	cons_:
negative	i have been left unsatisfied in every possible way with workwear_express ' initial service , customer service and after sales .
negative	but i try to avoid facebook like a plague .
positive	i placed my order late_afternoon and immediately wished i had requested express delivery - no need as next_morning i recieved message_advising next_day delivery including time .
neutral	really pleased to get my order so quickly , though it was just left on the doorstep and not around the back as requested when i completed the delivery instructions .
negative	it is now late so i went on live_chat to find out were it was as the dhl_tracking site has not been updated since it was ordered .
positive	i would definitley recomend them and in fact i have done so .
negative	i then edited my review for the same company , adding the comment that i expected my negative_review to be challenged , which it was , so my review cannot be seen .
negative	fair_enough you may think , as it gives the supplier a chance to put his case which they did .
neutral	items however were just as_described .
negative	vianogo .
neutral	regardless of having several_hundred_pounds a month available income after completing payments on two large loans with my bank .
neutral	however i did have to send back my lovely boots as one of the poppers came off after only wearing for 0 hours .

negative	huzzah !
negative	an_email i sent complaining_about a £ 0 overcharge has_gone unanswered for over a fortnight .
neutral	it seems to me that this is a potential weakness in an otherwise promising model .
negative	then on 00 / 0 / 00 i got yet another email , now saying it would be delivered to their warehouse on 00 / 0 / 00 , again with no information about when i would receive it .
negative	a company that seems to spend most of its time defending itself from negative_feedback has more problems that it cares to admit to in public .
neutral	this is a very misleading sales_technique , and in fact not true .
negative	then wait and wait for the bill .
negative	summasumarum købes der ikke mere i bolia . com - jeg står og skal købe en ny sofa , men_det bliver helt sikkert ikke hos bolia , den ville jo ikke kunne være i en taxa heller .
negative	shop with caution .
negative	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to [_private_data_] in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning [_private_data_] this may cost 00p_per_minute .
neutral	next time i would ensure that i emailed to ask exactly_what came with the outfit .
negative	i accepted this .
neutral	was put on hold for 0 minutes .
neutral	similarly the delivery is part of the fun .
neutral	the packet arrived completely open and as the plain paper envelope wasnt padded both boxes for the adaptil items purchased were crushed and bent .
negative	extremely angry , and looking to further my complaint about them .
neutral	the leg extention is not in line .
negative	so i checked my emails and have had a reply this afternoon that huffily informs_me " not a problem .

positive	now i just go on line , tick the product i need , and it arrives in the post usually next_day .
negative	if you ask for a refund they email back saying that my order was just about to be sent but they have stopped it in case i want a refund .
positive	i sourced the westfalia detatchable towbar from p_f jones as the garage i bought my car from quoted me a much higher price for same item .
negative	they will immediately do nothing because they need to hear back from their partner .
negative	after several e_mails and phone_calls , many were ignored , i gathered that i had spent too long in trying to rebook , though the possibility of such a time limit was not apparent in the literature .
positive	can '_t ask for anymore really .
neutral	then we followed the instructions for the first chair - all pretty straight_forward until it was time to fit the arms .
neutral	. probably but if this happens too often ill be ringing around .
neutral	it did wash off but not really good quality control in my opinion .
positive	i purchesed a set of wiper_blades from np_autoparts recently , but on receipt found a connector was missing .
negative	extremely disappointed & would warn_others not to buy until they have sorted_out their customer_services ( a phone number to actually speak to someone would be helpful !!)
neutral	my cheque took almost 0_days to get to me i phoned up and then they discovered it had been lost in the post , the next_day mazuma_mobile sent a cheque again which then arrived the next_day !!!
neutral	it was the faulk of the post_office and not delivering my package when due and still have not have gotten it and guessing it is loss or taken . thanks to lenstore they are kind enough to sent out an replacement order and in hopes there will not be a problem with out postal service delivering it to my home .
neutral	taxis are readily_available but work out quite_expensive if using them regularly .
negative	we thourght we had contacted a company that was going to help us .
negative	used the email contact and the feedback form and nothing .
positive	i usually find a few %_off using a discount_code too .
positive	thank_you for such a great service , will recommend to friends and family any day .
negative	a complete_rip_off .
neutral	received willy_wonka suit which i was told was for a 0 - 0 year_old ref_: jmt0000000 .
positive	i didn_'_t see the flowers but my friend said that they were a lovely surprise and very pretty .
neutral	unless the seal is fitted in warmer temperatures it can be difficult to apply the sealant and get good joint .
positive	the company were very quick to deliver and have a wide_range of products , so i shall_certainly use them again .
neutral	quite tasty though .
neutral	a fundamental necessity i would have thought when buying a new car .
neutral	great that you can get a full_refund by returning to superdry if bought online ( unlike in the stores you can only get a credit_note or exchange ) the only_drawback with posting back to get your refund / exchange being the cost to return your items as they are usually quite bulky / heavy expensive items and it can become expensive to return if you order a couple of sizes to try .
positive	if only all companies were like this .
neutral	i was given a delivery date no time and stayed in all day no delivery arrived .
positive	take a look at rubbersole , for the coolest kind of footwear :)
neutral	good quick delivery and communication well up to scratch .
negative	my order was placed on 00 / 00 /_0000 for items that were shown as in stock and available for immediate delivery .
neutral	i was expecting to see a picture of the jigsaw on the box .
negative	they were very apologetic and advised the items had been received in their warehouse ( they ignored my comment that they were shown as being in stock when order was placed ) and were in the process of being booked in !
positive	some items out of stock but i was kept up to date with the remainder of the order by email .
negative	the senior escalation manager keeps stating that my queries have all been answered , although they haven_'_t , and keeps closing my ticket ( the one complaining_about the other tickets not being answered ).
positive	we signed_up with handepay for one year . its been so successful we have signed_up for a longer_term . ive recommended handepay to my friends and family in business and with the help from neil wigby we have found them to be reliable with a great service and most of all very competitive dont_waste your time looking around use handepay .
neutral	it seems that they costco are just too slow to react to price fluctuations in the current fiercely competitive retail environment and if they carry on they will lose out on membership .
neutral	best regards
negative	bored girl informed me that they have a set route and even_though their only job is to deliver parcels and they must have known this would not be fulfilled , they won_'_t change the time .
positive	good response , dealt_with problem of missing part , super swiftly .
negative	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
neutral	unfortunately , we received another phone_call trying to rearrange for another date , when we explained that we already had been given a delivery date and had made arrangements , they denied that they had even called .
negative	worst online outfit i have ever_encountered .
negative	ordered flowers 0_weeks in_advance for my mother '_s birthday .
negative	he was curteous and patient , running back and forth until i had the exact shoes i wanted that fit_perfectly .
neutral	the first charge was for 00 times my usage and i had to contact the company to straighten it out despite having quoted usage figures in my application
negative	this is obviously deceitful and i would expect better from such a company .
positive	i will be back !
positive	first_class service , highly_recommend dealing_with axminster .
neutral	what let them down was the delivery service .
positive	great product and does '_t stink the house out with tobacco smell .
negative	professional landlord : 0_weeks and still_waiting for the money .
negative	i then sat on hold waiting for a customer service rep for an_hour and a half listening to the most dreadful music ever , clearly designed to make you hang up and give up .
positive	the select_specs website was very easy to use and i could get a realistic idea of lens size and shape .
neutral	also i was missing my free_samples for the mother '_s day deal , so wonder_if these had fallen out !
positive	had been looking for smaller things for diving and waterports looked pretty well_equipped .
negative	suspect they are crooks as others have found .
neutral	i recently ordered some perfume from cheapsmells . com and unfortunately it wasn_'_t that great .
neutral	i was asked to email photos of the items , and was told once they had been reviewed , replacements would be sent out .
positive	quick delivery .
positive	unbeatable service .
neutral	i can only_assume that the printer or print machine which printed the calendars was different from that which printed the books .
negative	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
negative	my daughter saved for two_weeks for ipod_dock adaptor .
positive	very happy - everything worked as it should
negative	avon_tyres should put this company in order - advertising avon_tyres on line and then offering a competitors product
neutral	the delivery firm picked_up one day , delivered the next , leaving me with problems being in on 0 occasions .
negative	they responded to say that they didn_'_t need to check , as they had confirmation it had been signed for , and would be happy to pass the signature over to amazon ( still means nothing !!
neutral	i took a screen grab as proof and emailed customer_services .
neutral	the worst thing was the delivery - the drivers would make no effort to deliver to room - all that was required to manoeuvre was to remove doors to move - other_firms delivery firms have been helpful and assisted ( indeed another delivery firm delivering another item from a different form ultimately assisted getting the wardrobe_upstairs with little major effort or difficulty - i think a better delivery contractor is required .
negative	this shower will put every obstacle in your way to prevent you ending a 0 month rolling broadband contract .
positive	no more to say .
neutral	this is really poor .
negative	parking at edinburgh_airport is expensive and a big rip_off i would estimate for each space they make around £_00 , 000
negative	as i no_longer need the domains i did not update - and they took the money anyway !
positive	flowers were delivered quickly , the communication was perfect .
neutral	quite good but some metchants do not confirm cashback and is still pending even after cashback date has long passed
negative	had to rebook with another courier and now have an upset client to deal with .
negative	i have had to purchase a 0nd_hand bed and pay a van to deliver , at my own_expense .
neutral	only_gripe is that i ordered this on a sunday , expecting dispatch on the following_day as promised on the website .
neutral	this could happen every time i scrolled_through my photos - very annoying and made the process so much longer_than it could have been .
positive	lots of choice too .
negative	present the next_day because i could not be at her_birthday_party .
negative	never again
neutral	ordered a dress and had to return it as the sizes were on small side but loved the dress so went to reorder but completely sold out and if you look at many dresses on the website they too are sold out .
negative	the service is poor , when problems with tenants occur they distance themselves and then claim they don_'_t deal with non paying tenants ?
negative	the company was quite happy for me to fade away and take the hit sitting behind a note in small_print on their website informing any buyer to report damage within_00hrs of receipt .
neutral	struggled to get the aeg fridge_freezer that we were after , and kitchen_appliances 000 were helpful when taking the order where others weren_'_t .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	!
negative	why does it take seven to ten days to process a refund ?
negative	0 .
neutral	however , i actually received a large package containing 00 x 000 packs .
positive	this is proper chocolate with no compromise because its being used for cooking .
negative	the shoes were advertised as new and in perfect_condition .
negative	the very next_day i received an_email from groupon saying as they haven_'_t heard from me they will be closing my enquiry !
negative	the girl i spoke to was very helpful , advised that the mattress was in the warehouse but she would get a delay put on dispatch until the 0th_jan .
neutral	in the meantime , i '_m off to find a new supplier .
negative	he confirmed he had refused to deliver this for over a week as it was damaged and advised me not to accept delivery .
neutral	i booked this evening and forgot to add one of the passengers .

positive	thank_you harrogate_holidays .
negative	worst customer service ever - imagine this was your £_000 photobook .
positive	what more could you ask for ?
negative	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
negative	no aplogy , no explanation , nothing - just a premium 0000 number to phone !!!
positive	can '_t fault them , had never_heard of them before searching for a particular pair of air max 0 '_s that i couldn_'_t get in my size anywhere_else , came up on their site and after doing a bit of research all seemed legit so ordered .
neutral	why ?
positive	i really love the range of products available at guitarguitar , co . uk , and the superfast delivery .
negative	it didn_'_t fix the issue and the person in store refused to change the phone until i had a long conversation with a manager over the phone .
neutral	hired a car from them in january much_better car and service as it was from the resort not the airport and you saw the car before you payed for it
positive	good cut keys .
positive	considering the order came from jersey it arrived within couple of days , the order must have been dispatched within couple of hours of me sending it , also the carriers were definitely quicker_than royal_mail .
negative	instead , a somewhat off had & not to sympathetic lady form customer service phoned me to say that ofl had reviewed my photographs & decided to offer me £_00 compensation .
positive	patient and understanding .
positive	i was immediately emailed to advise delivery would take a couple of days .
negative	a week before_christmas i contacted specialised_covers and never got a reply by mail or telephone_call .
negative	would not use the site again .
negative	ained .
negative	wont be useing serenata_flowers again !
positive	well , being known for being careful with my money , ( tight ).
positive	i booked online which was very straightforward .
neutral	canceled order but out of pocket taxi_fare to and from garage !
negative	no call , no email - no nothing .
positive	very easy access to trams and the bus network .
neutral	if the holiday i book says flights from gatwick are available and the hotel is available .
neutral	i have spent a lot of my quality time chasing up orders that have not arrived .
positive	immediate_dispatch
positive	quick delivery , kept_informed on progress by email , no_problems also a lot cheaper_than screw_fix its etc .
negative	the title pretty_much sums it up !
negative	i had provided a genuine order number and even went to the trouble of sending trustpilot a photograph of the damage , but unsurprisingly , this seemingly deceptive site decided to side with their client electricshop , which , like many of the businesses that are featured here , pay a fee which gives them extra control over and approval on any reviews submitted .
positive	would also recommend this company as delivery was swift .
negative	i then emailed a week_later after_hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
neutral	fast delivery nice wheels and a good price but the £_00 . 00 pounds per_tyre service to have them fitted at a designated tyre_centre is a massive rip_off i went independant and was charged £ 0 . 00
neutral	a letter was received dated 0 march telling us that due to delays with suppliers ( what else ?
neutral	only down_side is there is no " pay upfront " option so you have to keep your money aside until closer to travel time .
negative	looking at the comments on here it seems they will be losing all the customers they once had .
negative	i was told in no uncertain_terms this is the price and made to feel very unwelcome .
positive	product quality is superb with really quick delivery .
negative	they were a small , cellephane wrapped bunch which did not even contain the flowers depicted in the image .
negative	the collection was rebooked for that day .
positive	i must let you know that the bios needs resetting after installing this memory .
neutral	great before the tourists started to pour in at about 0am !
positive	will certainly use them again .
positive	so it was a trip out to burford .
neutral	online shop style websites that aren_'_t accurately maintained are one of the main_reasons i '_m still to be convinced that internet_shopping is more convenient , because i '_m now being inconvenienced by the delay .
positive	great service .
negative	i went back on the website and checked the item which was definitely pictured as the tape type and described as tape / cord which i took to mean either or and as the tape was pictured thought this was what i was ordering .
positive	quick delivery .
neutral	there may have been cameras as in a airport you would expect that but the price paid for the service then you would expect at_least some visibility .
positive	my expectations were exceeded and i will be placing many more orders in the future .
neutral	tive 0 experiência completamente distintas , normalmente a pior é sempre a que marca o_serviço que experienciamos .
neutral	i did open a call with geotees and they have said it will be rectified in a few_days so hopefully not all bad :)
neutral	i was told they would try and access marc '_s email and try and get the order to me by 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	0rd_attempt - courier claimed to come , knock on the door and ring the doorbell .
positive	it is easy to navigate , yet packs in plenty of detail .
negative	if you fancy your chances go_ahead .
neutral	their website says you can over the phone .
negative	for the sake of £ 0 i could have ordered on my amazon_prime and got next_day delivery wish i '_d stuck to my usual and not bothered with this company .
negative	it was finally delivered , only because i happened to look out the window as the van was driving by .
neutral	\ will still be a returning customer tho !!
neutral	the only_reason i ordered off this site in the first place couple of years_ago was that they stocked my favourite_perfume which they don_'_t do anymore and now tell me they have not heard of it when i search the site , makes me sad , so come on please_please get_hold of " myqueen " eau_de parfum by alexander_mcqueen again so i can buy more .
positive	an excellent service all_round
positive	even if i had to leave a refundable_deposit to ensure its return .
positive	will_definately_use again .
neutral	in practice , however , it only dispatches dark red and this only becomes apparent once the goods are delivered .
positive	if ever need would definately_use them again .
positive	good value product , excellent delivery service , can '_t ask for more .
positive	i '_ve_used this store for years , and this is one of the best websites for purchasing supplements and fitness supplies .
positive	nothing has_been too much_trouble !

positive	i received the order within two_days of sending the prescription .
positive	a very good quality dress fior the money , really stylish , and despatched promptly .
neutral	a week_later the 0nd pair arrived and are fine ( so_far ) but i '_m disappointed at the delivery and repair times .
neutral	i placed my order with express delivery as i rehomed a cat with special_dietary_needs , however the goods were not delivered at the specified time .
neutral	special instructions : please kindly deliver as late as possible but before 0pm as birthday is on sunday only .
negative	can '_t_believe_how customer_services are treating me , i was just told that the member of staff who startled me twice , offended and then humiliated publicly , is just like that and ( i '_m actually on hold to them now waiting for a manager ).
positive	the bosch blades i ordered were excellent and cleared the windscreen very well .
negative	they are always very pleasant on the phone and promised that i would get a replacement felt sheet quickly or that someone from the manufacturer would call .
positive	i subsequently took another picture and we went with this one .
positive	customer_focused and kept me in the picture all the time
negative	we are now proceeding to your refund and should be
neutral	this firm is good but they do pester you !
negative	since the panda update in 0000 the website has dropped dramatically into oblivion , google webmaster gave a warning about the detection of paid - for links .
neutral	two_days_later i received my part , in excellent condition and extremely well_packed .
positive	installing was very quick and easy .
negative	stuffed full of traders - most of whose prices can be_beaten elsewhere .
neutral	this was on a thursday , as they did not
neutral	i told you twice about this and you failed to remedy it .
negative	called the customer service team on friday 00 : 00 was told they had rung the store on thursday and spoke to ( name_removed ) who was to ring me .
negative	xmas came and went .
negative	not to be deterred i checked online availability at another branch and again the item was in stock and it allowed_me to reserve it for in - store collection .
negative	its only since last december when i moved home that i have experienced the sheer_incompetence of this mob .
negative	we asked for mike norbury too which he came too see us .
negative	best regards ,
positive	precioius little one also had the best price :-) anyway i also got an extra discount for liking them on facebook so was definitely a very happy_bunny .
positive	delivery was lightning_fast too with step by step progress texts and emails so i knew_exactly where my item was all the time with a 0 hour delivery slot by text .
negative	if i had gone to are local_garage would have picked_up better and at_least they would not be in a box . serenata_flowers i will have no problem telling anyone i meet never to use your company , have put in a complaint and got a reply not even speaking about most of details of my email . stay well clear

positive	good service , my computer was really fast now used the 0 gig . good job mr_memory . :)
neutral	goods arrived in good time , but when i went to return i had to email the company for a returns_form .
positive	the games i bought for my grandchildren were really exciting and the chess learning game is especially used .
positive	this is the second time i have used serenata_flowers and was very pleased with my recent_purchase , thank_you
negative	i recently had to send my driving_licence ( both paper and photo card parts ) to dvla in swansea to have my photo updated .
negative	it is rare i leave a review and this is the first time i have ever left a bad one but i felt_compelled to do so .
neutral	no_issues at all .
negative	fordralet till min mans samsung note 0 är dock fint och verkar hittills hållbart så_det kan absolut reommenderas .
neutral	perhaps it could be made easier to change orders , no response from customer_services after 0 hoursis not acceptable .
negative	so they said yes , it ’ ll be canceled in up to 00 days at the most .
positive	good value for money and postage rates reasonable .
positive	ordered one day , arrived 0 days_later -- perfect
negative	each time i had to email the conversation to them via their website form so that i could get written confirmation .

positive	have been with them 0 years .
positive	i would totaly recommend this service from offtek
positive	one of the few suppliers i could find that would offer this removal / recycling service albeit for an additional small_fee but well_worth it to someone without their own transport !
positive	excellent service
negative	i regret spending my money on the big_bus_tour .
neutral	at_least this time i knew where to find them - 00 minute_walk from the terminal in sub_zero temperatures .
neutral	modtog ingen belræftelse , men i stedet en " anmodning om tilbagebetaling ".
negative	middlesex .
positive	i loved my item and was delighted when it arrived so quickly , bearing in mind it was near christmas .
positive	great products at very competitive_prices .
neutral	the instructions say screw the " hooks " into the wall until 00mm is showing out of the wall but that '_s not possible as they have a shoulder on them and therefore the depth is not adjustable and it sticks out significantly more than that .
negative	sorry .
neutral	i have a very good dslr_camera and the print quality in the book is very pixelated .
positive	you assume that because goods are available in britain they can be obtained everywhere .
negative	if it ends up as just an unused icon on your desktop ( how many have we got of these !)
negative	as it was out of hours , i had an online_chat to see if i could email a commerical invoice over .
positive	i ordered thursday and got my order friday free !!!
negative	a richer_sounds engineer looked at photos of the crack rang me and said i must have hit it with something .

positive	the good lady knew what she wanted but being a housewife wanted the pennies to go further .
positive	arrived speedily .
negative	i have complained twice and i recieved an_email_telling_me that the complaint has_been sent to the courier company but still i '_ve heard_nothing .
neutral	the problem was with the courier .
negative	they could not supply the item i ordered .
neutral	0 .
negative	i am yet to receive a yodel delivery that is on time - in fact it is so bad that i research who the online_retailer uses as a courier and if it is yodel - i avoid them !
negative	i couldn_'_t afford to argue or take issue with this so close to the date of moving - this was less_than 00_hours beforehand , and i needed to be out of the property .
neutral	rita patel
neutral	grrrrrr .
neutral	one question that does spring to mind is where does their revenue come from ?
neutral	this was a present for my daughter who didn_'_t want to wait for me to return this and get another and luckily isn_'_t bothered about the camera , so i '_ve decided to keep it , but next time i will be wary of believing the descriptions stated .
positive	we has fantastic seats in both theatres the hotel was second to none and it was everything i wanted well_done ticket_tree
neutral	stunning flowers , although they where much smaller than_expected , prob wouldn_'_t use an online web_site again as a picture isn_'_t a good guide to what you will actually get .
positive	sews quietly and smoothly .
neutral	using the contact message page in their website i asked what the expectations were on the shipping date two_weeks after the initial order .
neutral	got a good deal at affordable_supplements .

positive	i was looking for a set of decent kitchen_knives that will last .
positive	ordered from the whiskey_exchange , nice gift package and the service was really good , kept_informed every_step of the way .
neutral	someone is trying too hard to impress , the advice emails and / or texts are just over the top .
negative	i sent in monthly readings to first_utility , who did not use my electric readings as they were so low . perhaps it could be the solar panels and the fact that i live in a sustainable house with low_energy needs .
neutral	acquired this a few hours_later and sent in my order .
negative	i had a call from a tnt driver on monday_afternoon to ask for directions and he quite easily brought a 0 ton lorry almost to my door !!
negative	the flowers on your website looked luscious and full , the flowers received were crushed and about 0 " in diameter .
neutral	this combination of these two factors meant that i was the last to board my flight .
positive	great
negative	i have tried 0 times via_email to contact wowcher but no one will reply and i have also telephoned twice only to be on hold for 00_minutes then to be cut_off saying no advisors are available .
negative	what '_s the point of sending special_occasion flowers if there '_s a 00 / 00 chance they won_'_t arrive .
negative	whoever it was at 000 - reg who came up with this policy needs to go on a course on how not to p *** off existing_customers .

positive	believe but true !!
negative	after trying to implement we came_across numerous issues and raised tickets which went_unanswered and were later told that ticket system was not there for implementation issues and we should have opted for paid implementation .
neutral	however , some of the news pieces are not replaced flor days and the selection of news items is very short ,
neutral	i would like to purchase an ipad_mini from a retailer which will cost me £_000 . 00 and the best cashback deals works out at just £ 0 . 00 !!
neutral	i ordered a colour_cartridge & black_cartridge at the same paid by pay_pal .
neutral	as above , the process and notification was very good .
neutral	use competitors instead - better prices generally better and whole_process much_quicker !
positive	ordered online and got an extra 0 %_discount .
neutral	car not delivered on return .
negative	( name_removed ) stated after a few_minutes that the manager was unavailable at this time but she would contact the store again .

negative	not if you paid me , you poor , unfortunate employee of this scummy company !
negative	so i decided to place order on line .
negative	still not resolved !
positive	also , the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful !
neutral	!
negative	i wrote to them and they were unhelpful claiming i got the correct e_- ticket number .
neutral	never had any_problems with orders till now but the order arrived as normal but one of the sand paper belts was ripped , not a major problem but its expense you don_'_t really need at this time
neutral	unfortunately i could not make out the code required on my email so they would not honour the offer .
negative	i told her asda selling the lager to me not the children .
neutral	however , after a while of explaining and re - explaining my situation along with a timeline of events , the customer service rep then understood .
negative	i have never_experienced_such unprofessional service before .
neutral	however , next time i will look at other rentals to see if you are able bring back a full_tank without direct charge as this may well save_money and change any view of the overall rental cost .
neutral	one customer service representative told me that photoworld received thousands of orders and cannot be expected to trace every one of them .
positive	hassle_free , fast payment , could all be done sat on the sofa .
neutral	also a two man delivery was charged extra , my man being available to assist was refused on insurance grounds .

neutral	unfortunately late but that was prob down to my local postie not knowing when valentines_day was
negative	i would urge anybody to stay_away from p0go and go direct with a reputable parcels courier .
neutral	from deciding on a car to actually getting the car took a few_months .
positive	all in all a really good product that will be used regularly whilst the weather permits .
negative	i was then persuaded that the solution would be to take out a new contract which would give me a stronger connection and a new modem .
negative	in the meantime , phoned , emailed and been sent up the garden path .
positive	quick reliable service , will use again .
negative	they have no interest in your order , your needs or how much you spend .
positive	bought my worktops from worktop_express what a brilliant company to do_business with , the service was excellent from ordering to delivery , the guys who delivered them where very obliging .

neutral	perhaps a diagram ?
positive	this is the first time that i have used the company and their website .
neutral	i was advised on work that would need doing to the car ( even_though i did not ask for this to be done ) which was good .
neutral	i called again two_days_later and spoke to someone different , again they took the information and said they would call me back , guess_what , they never called .

neutral	unfortunately when our minibuses arrived they forgot to bring the trailer for the luggage .
positive	wanted to surprise my friend and went online found the company i thought looked the most professional and sent her flowers .
neutral	a good end product when received .
negative	i tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward " please hang on while i transfer you to a member of our team . sorry , our opening_hours are monday to ." i then logged on to the website to try and sort .
neutral	i am completely_satisfied with the jumper .
neutral	would advise you to check that all the details are understood before you fly out if you are requesting a large vehicle .
negative	called them up to complain , they freely admitted this was their error and promised to refund .
negative	0 and one no .
neutral	the bungs on the cab step rubbers are too large on the diameter ,
neutral	if they were just for me i might not have minded so much as the knives were not damaged , but as gifts they look a bit_tatty , like i found them rather_than bought them .
negative	in a nut_shell if you have paid by cc or dc your in trouble .
neutral	rather annoying that i had to go to a more_expensive competitor and also pay for next_day delivery to get the additional unit in time for the job i needed them for .
positive	martin from hereford
negative	so this has_been a very costly transaction for me .
neutral	ii was charged differently to what was stated on the final_bill !
negative	they apparently won_'_t leave a parcel without a signature ( even thought the company sending the kit doesn_'_t request one ) but on the 0 occasions i have left a signed card out they have still failed to leave the parcel in the porch as instructed .
positive	like many others , i came into contact with this courier through purchasing off amazon .
negative	have cancelled order , never order again pcw
positive	i like the product in all_aspects
neutral	first time since i was a child being on a ship and i was fine .
negative	customer service was terrible , they couldn_'_t even have the decency to reply when i asked who was supposed to have signed for the parcel as i knew there wasn_'_t anyone in the address to sign for it .
neutral	managed to secure next_day sat delivery and once had contact details were able to communicate_effectively with expected delivery times .
positive	thank_you
positive	not knowing the company , we ordered a couple of things and crossed our fingers .
neutral	have you changed the way you print the albums ?
neutral	the service provided by walls and floors is very good as regards materials , delivery and advice , however when advertised that orders over €_000 get free delivery and also being offered a 00_%_discount_code disappointingly when discount is applied and your order goes below €_000 you then fall_foul and get a large delivery charge , this then meaning buy more to get over the €_000 threshold again to get your free delivery .
negative	he thought he could do a moonlight flit and shaft all his customers , but i did some sleuth work on the net and found that the company was still active with him as a director and they had cash in the bank but high debts .
positive	you have to try it .
positive	i will not_hesitate to recommend your company to my friends and family , however , as i am not prone to make purchases over the internet in view of the size problems incurred will probably ' shop locally ' in the future .
neutral	didn_' like having to pay for a full_tank .
negative	my advice , use another company !
negative	i tried to ring customer service but the line was dead .
neutral	a shame as your service previously has always been excellent .
negative	called again for around 00_minutes , did all the line testing that i already do with my eyes_closed .
neutral	the only thing that i can say that spoilt it for me was the element of surprise to my partner .
negative	all in all an unpleasant_experience and a mistake i will not make again
positive	many_thanks
neutral	the item arrive and as i expected some things didn_'_t line up .
positive	i found the company on google .
neutral	an overhaul is needed of their commenting system , which is poorly implemented and usually just serves the purpose of breeding criticism and arguments between users .
negative	this was the first time i had used workwear_express and defiantly the last , will not be bringing my business to them again .
neutral	because i was not in and depite saying leave in the porch if not in .
neutral	the driver went to the wrong house and i '_m not very impressed .
neutral	without even calling_card being left on doors .
negative	i noticed its " compare market " link shows giffgaff as the cheapest payg uk provider .
positive	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !

positive	brilliant communication and kept_informed every_step of the way .
positive	i don_'_t do a lot of printing , this is for home , so i guess if you did higher volume , you '_d need to keep a stock of spares .
neutral	the whole buying experience was perfect apart_from quite slow delivery .
negative	i purchased an item on the 0rd of july was told delivery 0 working_days , no product arrived , contacted groupon and was lied to 0 times that my order was with royal_mail , im still_waiting after 0_weeks for my product .
positive	this was the first time i had ordered from them .
neutral	item arrived quickly and price was acceptable
positive	great site , easy to use and great delivery times .
negative	on the 00th of april i enquired again as to when stock would be available , product still out of stock .
neutral	very pleased with price & quality of product - upset that the delivery company took it to a different company ( shop ) some half mile_away and it was only due to their dillegence that they rad the label and bothered to get it to me .
negative	after being exited at the unusual party ideas , i was greatly disappointed to have paid £_00 . 00 to receive the order the next_day before 00 only for the incompetent person to have sent the order to the wrong post_code therefore not getting the order .
neutral	the feedback was that the chocolates were tasty , the flowers were pretty ( though not as spectacular as appeared on the image ).
negative	today i called to chase_up and the customer_services adviser was rude and sarcastic .
negative	after losing more than 000 . 000_pounds over the last 0 years ( including my home ) with william_hill , which ruined my whole life , i had my account closed under the responsible gambling act , william_hill assuring me they would do there upmost to prevent me gambling with them again ( 0 months_ago ) .
neutral	the website was easy to navigate .
negative	too expensive read small_print they won_'_t cover you under many circumstances
neutral	i decided not to send the bag back as firstly , normally bags like that are heavy before you put anything in it but this was extremely light and secondly , i really couldn_'_t be bothered to go through the returns_procedure .
negative	why are you the only company left on the planet that doesn_'_t accept electron for online shopping ?
positive	also shipping was 0 week to france , and reaaonably priced .
negative	i phoned them up , and you guessed it thy only had an answering_machine service .
negative	i wish i '_d done my homework before hand or i would never have ordered from them .
neutral	great machine .
negative	buyer_beware
positive	first_class service , would use again without_any hesitation
positive	i only needed a few chromed screws for finishing our guitar project .
positive	good quality items , prompt delivery , well_packaged , a very happy customer and more_importantly , a beautiful baby_girl '_s christening was a huge_success !
negative	we would never use this company again , will never recommend them and will tell anyone that asks the truth !!!!!
negative	i am frankly at the end of both my wits and my tolerance with them and am today sending them a letter advising they have 00 days to sort this or i will be putting all correspondance in the hands of my solicitor .
positive	your delivery men arrived bang_on time and were very helpful and pleasant .
negative	whenever i tried to change the password , or create a new ftp account , i was greeted with an error .
neutral	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
negative	( same number was showing for 0 days - i ' d been watching ! )
positive	the goods were carefully_packed and exactly as ordered .
neutral	i don_'_t think this is acceptable customer service .
positive	i will definitely use this website again as the delivery time was excellent and the order came well_packaged !

negative	but , try getting anything done through customer service .
neutral	i have since stopped taking them and had no further problems .
positive	my husband was very satisfied with the jacket i bought him it fitted really lovely , he would like a waste coat to go with it so i told him he would have to wait just a little while , but i will get him one as he dose not ask for much and he spoils me rotten .
neutral	its only something i ever use in an_emergency as all meals in our house are home cooked from scratch .
negative	at 0 . 00pm i had an_email to say it had been delivered and left at a secure_location at the front of the house .
positive	my wife was willing to purchase a new planet_ocean from my local omega dealer , but we managed to buy both watches from watchfinder for slightly less_than the planet oceans rrp .
negative	don_'_t let them get away with this appauling level of ' service '.
negative	this was a vicious circle , pixmania said they had sent it but dhl hadn_'_t received it .
positive	i got superb service and i am confident that i will get advice whenever i need it .
positive	i was cleaning my unit out from top to bottom .
negative	i refreshed my emails , clicked send / receive several_times . nothing from superfi , ok , bit_worrying , but ok .
neutral	when delivery recieved its done in way far inferior to other_companies that deliver for free leaving you with a pallet to dispose of .
neutral	lenses from here arrived few_days_later .
neutral	ordering experience was decent enough , but they wouldn_'_t match total_cost including cost of shipping by another company .
negative	called at 0 . 00_pm and spoke to steven , who said there was nothing in the notes about returning the old hard_drive !
neutral	several emails later , and weeks after the other site , i got paid .
negative	although we weren_'_t happy about it we understood the reasons_why they have that clause .
negative	i was informed that the courier had the item on 00st_october and first the courier claimed they could not access the house ( its on the main_road and has a wide driveway easily_accessed by all other couriers ) which was then changed to the house could not be found - there are only a handful of properties with the same postcode all next to each other , then it was changed that the courier would contact me directly to arrange delivery - that was over a week_ago and surprise , surprise that did not happen .
positive	we would definitely recommend formal_tailor to you .
positive	cant really fault the service and the site is easy to navigate and pay .
negative	first and last time i will ever use iflorist .
positive	however , it was such a small thing , i did not feel it worth dropping a star .
negative	i only wish i had done that in the first place .
negative	i was finally given the rental_agreement to sign and i queried the excess amount stated on there and the avis representative said that this was just how the agreement printed out but i would not have to pay the excess .
neutral	car was fine no problem , but firefly asked for 0 euro per day for zero_excess on insurance which i understood to be included , on returning home i have read the contract and am still under this opinion .
neutral	i was trying to find out if something was in stock the other day and the touch screen thing didn_'_t work .
neutral	you only get about 00p for a cd though , even for titles which i would consider to be hard to find .
neutral	i sent off my iphone 0 in working condition to get an_email back saying that they have tested it and rated it in a non working condition as it doesnt work on any networks .
negative	i certainly won_'_t be coming_back and will be taking my £ 0 , 000 for a new mac elsewhere - so short_sighted .
negative	ordered flowers for mother - in - law as was due to go in to hospital for an operation .
neutral	shame it was not as advertised on the web_site !
negative	when questionned , no response received ever .
positive	i bubble_wrapped the phone to be safe and sent it special delivery .
negative	dispatched quickly arrived_safely .
neutral	please imporve on the above points .
positive	well_done .
neutral	the lights arrived very quickly , packaged very well , and i was very keen to see them in_situ .
positive	got my order wrong on the internet but i phoned up and the order had not left the warehouse so i spoke to a nice gentleman that put it right with no problem .
negative	00 april 00
positive	then i ordered sunglasses clicked for one then two wowcher codes were sent to me when i only wanted one !!
positive	the price wa the cheapest i could_find .
positive	without a doubt my go - to music shop .
positive	sicuramente consigliato .
neutral	£ 0 . 00 .
negative	not only did it take more than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again .) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer service placements ).
positive	some people may be put off by the initial timescale 0 to 00 days , on this occasion i received my 0 pairs of glasses ( 0 being sunglasses ) within 0_days .
positive	they rang me to arrange delivery .
positive	i wanted to purchase a barbour_jacket for my husband but was unsure of sizing & style .
negative	i have now opened a dispute via pay_pal and will contact my credit_card tomorrow .
neutral	the opticians i took them too said they must have been prepared by someone_who had never fitted a pair of glasses to a human_being .
positive	thank_you , satisfy
negative	pretty easy to guess that my next glasses purchase won_'_t be from them !
negative	room for improvement on this tour would be the following :
neutral	although , i did request that the flower be delivered with a neighbour if no one was in .
neutral	sent my step mother birthday bouquet - had text_messages and email to say they had been delivered - was happy .
neutral	if i had known it was for a chart only , i wouldn_'_t have paid eight_pounds for that item .
negative	they offered me a replacement or a refund , i chose a refund which i still_haven_'_t received 0_days_later .
positive	i needed a cost_effective replacement and quickly .
negative	but extremely disappointed as not many flowers for the cost .
negative	when i phoned up i was assured that i was going to get a refund put through for that day which i understood would take 0 to 0 working_days to come through and the girl told me that she would send out the free box of chocolates like it should have been !!
negative	the order was placed on 00th_december_0000 , and supposedely dispatched on 00th .
positive	thank_you keep_up the excellent work .
neutral	so it was all squashed and split_open .
positive	i have now ordered 0 lots of furniture from oak_furniture_land and have been delighted with everything i have ordered .
positive	i recommend them .
neutral	stick to purchasing in store !
negative	last time i ever set foot in any of their branches .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time .
positive	i chose blue lights but even with the lights off , the stars look great with the sun catching the facets .
positive	sufficient packaging and happy with product .
negative	should have had my call yesterday to confirm time_slot , didn_'_t happen so i called today and was told yes all in order delivery will be tomorrow 0 - 00 . 00 and will call you on route - great . then within 00_mins get a call sorry have no stock can '_t make delivery tomorrow . someone will call you within 0_days to discuss when we might be able to deliver .
negative	one bunch has still not arrived on boxing_day .
positive	always prompt , good prices , never have any_problems .
neutral	very pleased with them .
positive	ron howard ,
negative	have sent a second email and now not holding breath .
negative	i explained the situation to the manager and she blatantly refused to refund my money citing a refund from another store would affect their store figures and for me to travel all the way back to the brixton branch to get my money back .
neutral	. except i had a text saying " your order ## has_been delivered and left_securely at the front of the property .
neutral	but horrified to see that city_link had posted a card through my door which stated "" box left by front_door " on the delivery label on box instead of stating my request it stated " special instructions ; if no answer please leave in a safe_place and card customer "
neutral	not so with the cdw , that is something sold by the booking company and totally_unnecessary if you take the comprehensive insurance which is cheaper .
negative	no consideration taken for me being aggravated or price reduction due to now being 0 days .
negative	i was told before i placed an order that i would be called before anything was dispatched to arrange a convenient delivery time - this did not happy and instead delivery was attempted on a weekday when no - one was home to take delivery .
neutral	we all make_mistakes and i made a mistake by sending an unedited print to pixum for printing .
negative	at 00 : 00 i got another text from o0 saying i had missed the delivery , i looked at the online tracker and it said " no one to receive card left " at 00 : 00 .
positive	if you book on line and pick_up at lanzarote_airport you can be driving away in 0 minutes .
positive	can you ask speedy delivery one very happy chap
neutral	i work away mon to wed each week and i am now told that they don_'_t have any delivery slots available for thurs / fridays so can '_t tell me when i will get my replacement .
negative	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand_tied them .
positive	i only needed new lenses for my daughters ski_goggles and i was advised of the cheapest way for this to be done .
positive	comunication was excellent .
neutral	the navigation on the site looks good , but makes it difficult to see the difference_between certain products .
positive	thank_you
neutral	very disappointing , however pleased with the new eyes .
positive	good customer service with an eagerness to help when i was looking for a watch for my sons_00th_birthday , also prices where reasonable , although they could not match the price of a rolex oyster that my wife purchased for my 00th_birthday .
negative	the status on my account showed ' delivered ' however this was mot the case .
negative	thanks to my dad being a solicitor , its pretty easy .
negative	i went to buy a phone for my gf from here and they tried to get me to get every insurance under the sun .
positive	i was expecting a parcel on 00 december .
positive	iwould reccommend the bead_shop as they have everything and more you need for beading and their delivery is fast .
negative	they did call me back and confirmed that yes i could now cancel the item and that i would get my refund within 00 days .
positive	good value
neutral	the only problem i had but quite a big one was the payment option .
positive	ordered new_washing_machine at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	numerous products all look to have similar ingredients .
positive	would definitely use this website again .
positive	i ’ ve bought a few things from prends ciclismo now and never had a problem .
positive	good pram , excellent shipment service , next_day delivery
negative	0 hours
positive	found it very easy to use and place the order .
negative	i could understand this happening once , but we find this happens on probably half our orders .
negative	the tnt driver who finally collected the parcel was polite , pleasant and very apologetic for the hassle i had .
neutral	it was flimsy and poor quality and did not reflect the online photos .
positive	during the order process i had to phone them to enquire_about a few items , they were very friendly and efficient .
positive	we had been looking for first_aid kits for our sports teams for a few_months with no success , by_chance one of our members provided the link to firstaid0sport and the rest they say is history !
positive	the only missing piece was a confirmation_email on successful delivery ( as the delivery wasn_'_t directly to me !)
negative	my whole_experience with this firm has_been appalling .
neutral	it did take several days after that before the items were dispatched and arrived .
negative	the item itself was of incredibly poor quality .
negative	if they ' re not , the retailer is in breach of contract and you have a claim under the sale of goods_act .
positive	great service next_day delivery .
neutral	we also expressed interest in a mazda 0 and he arranged a test_drive .
negative	combine them together and a mars bar would be more satisfying . luckily i got a huge box of thorntons chocolates for £ 0 . 00 !!!
negative	my credit_card payment was processed immediately .
negative	to this customer service girl - seriously you need re - training !
positive	!
positive	excellant product really pleased
neutral	canvas we ordered , arrived after a lot of trouble , it was very dark , we contacted ellen dobson of you frame it , who advised she would look into it and get it lighter and send a new one out , the canvas arrived but it was the same still dark not the same as original file we sent , as we were so disappointed as the picture was of our_wedding_rings we wanted it right , we emailed ellen dobson and asked for our money back , surprise_surprise no answer or reply , so they are very good and prompt at sending canvas_prints out , but if you want a refund not so quick
negative	dabs used to be a good & reliable retailer but i won_'_t be shopping there again and would not recommend that you do either .
positive	have never been let_down thank_you
positive	recommend !
neutral	i didn_'_t have any major complaints about the time taken to get through to someone , about 0 - 0 minutes each time i called .
positive	i have used tier0online twice_now and for quality products at hugely_discounted price this is the company to use .
positive	lewis
negative	i won a sony viao ( 0_months_ago ), this week , after several emails , they eventually tell me the item is no_longer in stock .
negative	i sent 0 - 0 emails asking where the product was .
positive	very good service especially_considering we had ordered the flowers and then found out that the person we were sending them to had been discharged from hospital early .
positive	i '_ve found the staff very helpful when inquiring via_email and would be happy to recommend them to family / friends .
neutral	now , that was really confusing .
positive	received a call to let_me know drivers_name and when he will arrive .
neutral	i ordered a protec riot helmet for my sons_birthday ( 0_weeks prior ) - after 0_days i heard_nothing on dispatch so when i chased i heard it was still coming from a store - nothing on my order said it wasn_'_t in stock .
neutral	from a choice of small , medium or large basket of summer flowers i selected large to be sent to new_zealand .
negative	so come 00th when my delivery hasn_'_t been i called the customer service .
negative	!
negative	customer service is prompt , but they offer no compensation other than original postage cost even_though you pay extra for insurance .
positive	good product / service
negative	you have told me you are not able to deliver the appliance to me .
negative	well a good start would perhaps be getting the name right !!!
negative	they later ring me back and state they did not issue this guarantee , and they have no proof of payment the windows were ever paid for !
positive	excellent service .
positive	while looking at systems , you can see which parts are compatible along with their details .
negative	delivery by one man and not two .
positive	set clear timeframes on when i should received items and stick to it .
positive	ordered sunday , arrived tuesday , wore wednesday !
positive	could not fault the service .
positive	superb info and help all along the way .
neutral	products arrived long after what one would expect to be a normal delivery time .
negative	two_weeks_later it still hadn_'_t arrived but they were insisting it would arrive any minute .
neutral	oops .
positive	posted my old phone off as soon as i ' d transferred the details to the new one .
positive	the costume was perfect !
negative	i hope i don_'_t die before i get that call .
negative	i telephoned again after they put me on anti - biotics for 0 months .
neutral	take care when preparing your files .
negative	he confirmed with his warehouse during this call he had only been at my door for now 0 minutes when they asked him how long he had been with me .
negative	shocking service and very dissapointed with the whole_experience .
positive	and within the 0 hour time_slot advised by email .
positive	very please with the product and service .
positive	with an amazing selection of products , surf_dome offers free delivery , easy and free_returns and an excellent service .
negative	i now await my refund of £_000 - will it ever come ?
neutral	also the ' goodie bag ' was terrible compared to many airlines .
positive	was really easy to use the website , the bag to post my old_mobile in arrived promptly and i got accurate emails all the way through the process telling_me what was happening next .
positive	great service , next_day delivery .
positive	no_problems , excellent service !
positive	i strongly_recommend this online florist , i ordered my girlfriend flowers at about 0pm and they were delivered with a hand_written note before 0pm .
neutral	if it had rained , any attempt to lift the goods would have meant the cardboard_packaging was too sodden to retain the 00kg it contained .
positive	very happy with the purchase and the product .
positive	from_start to finish the process was easy to understand and order , just before it all went through however , there was a chance to review the order , and , to check all was as it should be .
negative	i email the company and still have not received a reply .
neutral	i was disappointed to find that some of the flowers sent to my friend for her 00th_birthday were substandard ie dead or decayed .
neutral	another thing i '_ve noticed , and i hope this isn_'_t just me , is that the prices online are often different from the prices instore .
negative	we were worried that something_else would go_wrong on the actual day .
positive	competitions , free deliveries ( certain_amount of posts ), help and advice from the staff via the forums .
neutral	krgds ,
negative	morrisons are streets_ahead on quality
neutral	i didn_'_t realise that when they said free delivery , they mean '_t the amount of delivery promises it would take to deliver !
negative	took it to most local_store and was informed they couldn_'_t help , it needed to be returned by post .
negative	disgusting .
positive	i '_ve_used gmg for a good while now , got around 00 games or more from them as they do amongst the best offers available for them .
positive	i can thoroughly_recommend the attention and prompt delivery from discount supplements
neutral	thats when fun started , when looking for fitting_centre nothing .
positive	thank_you very much , i '_m_sure i will be ordering again soon :)
positive	despite reading negative_reviews i used interparcel and found them honest and reliable
neutral	i would have awarded 0_stars , however the supplied power_cable for the fender amplifier had a non - uk_plug fitted .
neutral	overall a poor service from iflorist .
negative	in principle the site and store is a great idea , unfortunately not run by people for customers . with too many expectations they fail to meet .
neutral	been a customer of g0m for many_years during which time i have purchased guitars , leads , mixers , keyboards and many other music_related items , the service use to be a good one - hence my remaining a loyal_customer , as of late i have found the service to be slipping .
negative	i could go on .
neutral	although i ’_m not suggesting that i was mislead , initially i was under the impression that the forecourt selling of £ 0000 was the value of the car and that the 0_months rfl was given as an incentive to purchase the car .
negative	i then had to wait to the monday to bombard them with emails to finally get a response as i was getting very annoyed !
neutral	phoned up , asked if my details were still on their system .
positive	i '_m always cautious_about using a new supplier , but you instantly proved that i could be confident in what you do and the service you provide .
neutral	0 times out of 00 everything is fine , but every now and again they are very slow to despatch the goods and seem to need a reminder , leaving you not knowing whether or not you need to buy something in the shops to tide you over until it arrives
negative	my experience is not one isolated incident .
neutral	help !
neutral	i '_m not fully sure about these_people .
negative	their customer service is non_existent , their response to emails are cut and pasted generic_responses .
positive	the prices are outstanding too .
negative	order reference :_000000000 .
positive	the service from one of the pauls and jamie was simply as good as you could ever need .
negative	paypal swiftly handed my money back to the scammer : s , even_though i had provided rock_solid evidence of my innocence .
positive	clear web_site , easy to use .
positive	what more can you ask for ?
neutral	rhys lloyd
negative	they collected 0 parcels from me , probably because it was a local courier sub_contracted to these robbers , 00 days_later , and still failed to deliver , 0 emails with no reply , and an ignored phone_call , at 00p a minute , just a bunch of liars and cheats , do not use these_cowboys
positive	shopping at suppliment warehouse is really is like breathing fresh_air :
neutral	for example it '_s hard to find details on excess and how to include loss cover ( i don_'_t think it '_s possible with an ipad but i still can '_t be sure ).
neutral	i had to take it back and wait another few_days before i got it back this time it seems to have been sorted but dont_know why it wasnt sorted the first time .
positive	i purchased serengeti eye_wear at a good price and received them next_day by registered_post .
neutral	very easy to use site with good choice of fragrances
positive	puts some of the bigger boys to shame !"
neutral	several comments were made about the wi_-_fi in the guest_book , yet the owners had done nothing .
negative	ordered a tyre that was on the site , paid up but when arrived for fitting a replacement was given as the tyre was obsolete from michelin - joke is when icaklled them they new it but blamed their web_site ha !
negative	i was then given an_automated_message_saying due to the launch of the " i phone " they where very busy and ." call back tomorrow ".
positive	yummy coffee_syrups !
negative	they told me to ring the number on the back .
negative	email to customer service . nothing .
negative	i also never received my free wireless charging pad as promised on their advert !!
positive	thank_you very much , guys !
positive	from works in hackney , east_london these_guys have a great personal service at superb quality for prices cheaper_than the big brands like photobox and others .
neutral	i would not use this service again for that very reason .
negative	in fact very '_s response was to cancel my order , refund the money to my account ( which i would not use again ) rather_than my card minus the delivery charge ( for an item that was not delivered !)
negative	so when you phone the phone rings for six minutes unanswered .
positive	i have used tyre_shopper probably 0 or 0 times over the past couple of years .
positive	order from marinestore with confidence . you will not regret it !
positive	well what can i say apart_from thank_you .
neutral	i emailed the sales_department and received a prompt reply ( to my relief ).
positive	great produce , at a great price !
negative	i had the misfortune to find and use prestige_flowers .
positive	premises were fantastic , i '_ve never seen a garage waiting room like it , clean and airy with nice decor , a huge contrast to the greasy mess i was expecting .
neutral	!
neutral	happy with quality and delivery , but not with amount of assembly needed .
positive	recently scoured the internet for a particular_style of barbour_jacket for a birthday_present .
neutral	i don_'_t appreciate this as it '_s a waste of time an effort .
neutral	i leased a car and after the salesman took my order and deposit it would appear he lost the use of his fingers and thumbs to communicate with me ie unanswered replies to my emails .
negative	talk about stress_free parking !
negative	immediately i received the phone back i put my old sim_card in and was able to use all the phone '_s functions !
neutral	when i chose the bouquet i opted to pay an additional £_00 for the largest on offer .
neutral	i wasn_'_t told this until after i '_d paid and ordered them .
neutral	the searching facility needs work .
positive	service was easy to arrange and only required a few simple steps to request pre_paid_envelope .
negative	i bought a sumvision multi card_reader it has developed a fault , i , posted my issue yesterday , i am awaiting a response from the technical_department , they cant be that busy surely .
negative	maybe the packaging wasn_'_t quite right as i was expecting a box , but they shouldn_'_t be handling things bad in the first place !
negative	they said they could transfer our phone number to our new home .
negative	this would be a good outcome and i will then remove this review and write a new review that reflects an excellent company that acts in an honourable and ethical way .
negative	!
negative	had very bad_experience with these_people and when , yes when ( because they will ) they lose your parcel they don_'_t make much of an effort to find it and instead just pretend that the tracking_number the they supplied does not exist ??????????
negative	none at all .
negative	i kept contacting him for a month or more and each time he would say : sorry i will refund your money .
positive	price_wise it '_s great value .
negative	we were waiting for a delivery that should have arrived two_days ago .
negative	i sent 0 bouquets of flowers to my aunt , unfortunate incident of 00_hours stuck in a bath , and my mum going to help look after her who ended_up tripping over and needing stitches to her cheek .
neutral	one half_dead , other totally dead .
neutral	good job i had nothing on that day and the garage was only a 00 minute_walk from home .
neutral	duly attended by technician , the results of which * i * had to chase a couple of weeks_later , after finding other faults .
neutral	fairly good selection but very expensive when used to buying wholesale
negative	i went and sat back in the reception .
positive	it was classed_as a and was in very nice second user condition .
negative	i then made my case very clear by phone and in turn by email , which was agreed by you that i had a case .
negative	also , do not trust all of the good reviews , things are not as they seem , go to moneysavingsupermarket for genuine feedback .
positive	that said that '_s a delivery issue , but worrying for single mums or if i '_d been at home alone at the time .
positive	if you wear branded perfume , makeup etc .
positive	the part was the most expensive we had seen but it arrived quickly and more_importantly it fitted and the problem_solved !
positive	the tux i bought was for my son who is 00 years old , we were going to a close friends wedding where he was performing magic with decks of cards !
positive	replied immediately and managed to arrange a delivery with very short_notice .
neutral	this was annoying , since there was no solution and we had to travel in the cornish countriside !
positive	they provide you with the costs of the handset before you send them they will collect if there are over 00 handsets free of charge and the communications methods they use are outstanding .
positive	items delivered within time specified and and packaged extremely well - informed by email about each_stage of the process .
negative	all of these comments suggest that you agree the advert was misleading , and in my opinion is exactly why your handling of my complaint was not at all suitable and was in fact the bare_minimum that you could have done .
negative	every time we have a delivery using citylink , without_fail , the first day will end with a gleeful " successfully delivered " status on their tracking with some bizarre name having signed for it .
positive	good range of products , all in stock .
negative	but it was now friday .
negative	the company did not honor their returns_policy .
negative	i do not see why i should have to pay this amount to change the name .
positive	i have consistently found hostelbookers to be the easiest , cheapest and most informative website to use .
negative	this has come at a time when with a family funeral yesterday and having my daughter and 0 month_old_grandson staying with me ( both with heart conditions ), i was forced to try to find them other accommodation nearby due to the lack of light , heating and hot_water .
positive	i am so pleased that i chose london_vision clinic for my laser_eye_surgery .
positive	have used twice in the last_week , 000_% satisfied " perfect " i wish all companies worked in the same way .
negative	i was well aware that i would have to cancel by a specific date to avoid being charged_£_00 . 00 for a full years membership .
positive	i eel that they value your custom
positive	i was delighted with the product when it arrived , ( which was swift and efficient delivery after ordering ) the quality of the leather and the beautiful embossing of the initials was perfectly and professionally done .
negative	:-) x
negative	i '_m hoping further surgery will correct the error they made , but hey - looks like i '_m the only one who could give a damn .
negative	as a customer for some years and using the service to protect the data for a small company ( 0 pcs ) we need a service we can_rely_on .
negative	all in all we have saved very little over rrp , ended_up with items we don_'_t particularly want and spent literally hours sorting all this out .
neutral	v annoying .
negative	the surprise of receiving the flowers was spoilt entirely .
neutral	one was delivered within this time .
positive	we have flown from stansted on several_occasions and were very impressed with parking through looking0parking .
neutral	however , they were very good with their communications to explain when they were sent out , although no explanation as to what the delay was caused_by .
positive	ordered the stove mid week , website was clear_concise and gave everything needed to make our decision .
negative	very poor customer service , i got the impression that their system errors were not their responsibility and therefore i could like it or lump it .
positive	thats what i did .
neutral	deducted £_00 for a tiny crack on the back of my iphone .
negative	waste of 00 quid !
negative	i have used serenata_flowers before and was happy .
negative	clearly only want folk to know about the good experiences and not the numerous_occasions when things go_wrong .
positive	i thought there may be a catch but there was not .
neutral	they failed to deliver when they we ' re originally supposed to , failed to re - deliver when they said they would , provided a number to call that was never answered , only offered a redelivery window of 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , impossible to contact to track the parcel , labyrinthine central phone system that eventually cuts you off .
positive	brilliant service and delivery .
neutral	hostelworld is a good website for finding hostels whilst travelling , but charging a service fee as well as taking a 00_% commission on all bookings . what '_s with that ?
positive	clear ordering site .
negative	i wear_contacts on a regular_basis and these contacts hurt my eyes .
positive	zoomfishgadgets dealt very efficiently with my transaction .
negative	contacted viagogo 0 times in the 00hrs leading up to the gig to try to rectify but didn_'_t hear a word back from them .
neutral	unfortunately , i had no option but wear them so i can '_t return them .
neutral	not the easiest
negative	i spent_nearly_£_00 on a photobook .
neutral	i was informed i would have it by the friday , i '_m writing this on the following_monday as i still have not received my item .
neutral	after arriving in our resort we visited another cabrera office and they were shocked at the contract and service we had received .
negative	asus m0a00l - m lx .
neutral	after the initial week and no further visits from villaplus staff , we settled down to our holiday .
neutral	good selection of sunglasses .
positive	what a pleasant change in this day and age .
positive	0st_class service from_start to finish . many_thanks
neutral	.
neutral	package was destoryed during process . waiting for ur response
negative	next step , as i paid by amazon , is to get them to sort this out or refund me , if not its trading_standards and the small_claims court .
neutral	slightly annoyed with the courier as they left the parcel outside our door , no attempt made to ring the doorbell or knock on the door .
positive	we were notified in_advance of the delivery date & time which was very helpful .
positive	delivery men rang 00_mins before expected time as arranged .
positive	an excellent service - thank_you .
negative	a company registered on anyvan might have 0_stars but may have only ever moved or couriered single items 0 miles up the road .

negative	======
negative	m
positive	received goods the following_day !
neutral	but wasn_'_t expecting it to be that quick .
negative	this german company delivered valentines_day flowers four days late into holland .
neutral	starting to get a bot concerned and have had no reply to my e_- mail asking where my contact_lenses are .
neutral	they should have been delivered on friday 00th_june by my yodel tracking said they had tried but no card was left at our house .
positive	i have just placed another order for my mother .
neutral	the problem is that the possibility of " duty " was not mentioned during the purchase .
positive	thanks
positive	i have bought , p / x and now sold to mpb , i have always been satisfied with prices and service , good communication and fast payments makes this company highly_recommend to anyone looking for camera gear .
negative	this company is a real problem for consumers .
negative	the result is constantly failing backups and a service that i cannot rely_on or trust and one that i have to supplement with local manual backups .
neutral	update - i received an_immediate_response from wowcher after my review asking me to contact them - which i did .
positive	package arrived within three_days .
negative	£_00 as a handling_fee over_£_00 in import_tax .
neutral	in fact , the way it worked was that i could text tutors but not actually meet up with one without first selecting that tutor , paying the fee and having a situation where that tutor was deemed to have been chosen without us even meeting .
positive	very happy with my purchase , even happier with the cost .
negative	i logged a ticket and received a reply leading me to link to track my complaint which requires a log in .
neutral	had i know the item was not in stock i would not have put the order in .
neutral	this however was totally_ruined by the change over of tour_guides when we decided to stay on to continue our journey to our destination for a restaurant we had booked .
negative	one bad_experience with either of these companies will fill you with enough hatred to last a lifetime .
positive	unlike_other advertisers who gave delivery date of maybe in 00 days time !!
negative	all in all , i think it '_s a terrible service .
negative	they are fond of posting a response on here that looks like they are going to do something about it but then they dont .
positive	i will use them again for certain .
negative	the window i was given was from 0am to 0pm ( even_though it says 0pm if you go to the " track my order " page ).
positive	really reliable and relevant searches .
positive	i went on line , found a compatible tyre , booked the time for it to be fitted .
negative	when things go badly ( returns , out of stock etc ) you never seem to get it right .
positive	i would recommend echo_supplements to anyone who_wants to purchase supplements online and without_any hassle .
neutral	however , i emailed customer support and after proving photographic_evidence of the breakages they replaced the broken stock straight_away .
negative	very , very poor service , for which i have paid .

neutral	i was very happy with the quality of the waistcoat but unfortunately it arrived rather badly_creased .
positive	response by phone and email were rapid .
neutral	i phoned customer_services 0 days after purchase to gain an update on my purchase and was dealt_with extremely efficiently and politely .
neutral	storage is a problem because you have to keep capsules in their box or you dont_know what you are drinking , the nesspresso capsules are colour_coded so you can have a few of each in a large dish so is handy to pick and mix
neutral	i wouldn_'_t normally mind , but the fact i '_d phoned to ask and was told they were fine clearly shows lack of knowledge .
negative	our apologies for this inconvenience .
negative	i ordered some products for my birds but they have not arrived after 0_weeks .

negative	!
positive	fantastic service kids_loved their trophies brilliant delivery and overall service thanks
negative	this increased my bt phone bill by over_£_00 .
neutral	i was very impressed with the service when booking and the collection went fine .
positive	i don_'_t do reviews , can '_t genuinely remember ever doing one before but was determined to do one for westin_gourmet .
negative	if i hadn_'_t contacted them , who_knows when i would have received either lenses or any contact from them .
neutral	ask for reviews after the product has_been fitted rather_than after it has_been paid for .
positive	great service will recommend to buy .
neutral	same as above
negative	all looked good , website looked nice , parcel booked in with ease , although waiting for a collection is another story . no show , myhermes said they would rebook when i called them , again another no show , so decided to cancel .
negative	so after having my grand die and having an_emergency c section to save my daughter life i choose to order mine and my husbands funeral clothing on boohoo . com as in unable to move around to get to the shops !
neutral	d
neutral	got my book back and it was very dark , i think you you should be able to use yours skills to adjust pictures within the book at your discretion .
negative	british_gas have the worst customer service in a company i have very come_across .
neutral	when i tried to set_up the account to pay , i kept getting a mesage that my email address already exists !
neutral	i carry in using the service because i have an account and can use the re - order button .
negative	pp disputes need to be raised withing 00 days so that is the path i took .
neutral	i have actually seen nicer bouquets in m & s for a fraction of the price .
negative	i will be reporting to trading_standards as they are still advertising as dispatch within 0 - 0_days on their website !!!
neutral	the procedure booking was quick and easy .
neutral	who uses a fax_machine nowadays ?

positive	totally efficient fast service which i was very impressed with .
negative	unreliable
neutral	voice_mail :
negative	thankfully the money went back to my account after 0 days , however the people i spoke to were unhelpful and rude .
neutral	so i '_m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
neutral	great products overall no_problems love the items , i like to order online as you can get better offers sometimes , its just easy to order and receive your item without going to find an actual store sometimes when you don_'_t have time to go out shopping .
positive	it was easily laid_out and when i was choosing my outfit it even made helpful suggestions as to what i would need to complete the whole look which i ordered .
negative	i checked and there is a label left by the manufacturer saying ' one seat only ' .
negative	travel up had duly cancelled all other four flights .
neutral	they have changed the catalogue areas from long benches to small circular table structures which now means that if it is busy you have to queue more to find an available catalogue whereas before there always seemed to be plenty of space .
positive	never recycled a phone before but glad i did as it was easy and got a fair price too .
negative	i will never touch vodafone again and i am pleased to say that my experience has persuaded many friends and colleagues to steer_well clear and when my company renews it '_s mobile_phone contract , which is a multi - million_pound contract , i will do everything i can to influence the decision to ensure that vodafone does not get it !
neutral	so , more phone_calls , more apologies , more messing_around generally , before the tiles finally arrived on 00st_january .
neutral	my dog_food was delivered on the very last day of the specified time .
positive	not the cheapest price i found , but i '_ve_used appliances direct before and i don_'_t mind_paying a little_bit more for a company i already trust .
positive	great choice of wallpapers - something for every age and taste .
neutral	the previous electronic stock finders might have looked a bit old_fashioned with their green screens and basic text but at_least they worked !
neutral	what more can i say .
neutral	i found a number i liked and went_ahead with the purchase .
neutral	my total expense came out to be about 00 $ usd and was expecting to pay about 00 $.
negative	in my view , they are unreliable and the whole_experience of after care was annoying , time_consuming and frustrating .
negative	amazon , john_lewis etc ), whenever they use hdnl .
negative	you are rubbish .
negative	drum_stop claims to provide :
positive	the service is fast , simple and reliable , i use them and recommend them .
neutral	i contacted dfs to express my disquiet however i was told that it had been in the sale but was now back up to full price , very helpful .
positive	0 ) tried three different cards
positive	i recommend to everyone .
positive	i '_ll be buying some more for sure , as i don_'_t always get a chance to get out of the office at lunch_time so to have a store cupboard of now yummy back ups is great as you can combine most with the packet rice to make a proper meal out of it .
neutral	making someone buy a new ticket as they ' re travelling on a different train by necessity is just plain mean .
negative	waited another 0_weeks to receive the glasses .
positive	my advisor paul kept me updated from_start to finish and i couldn_'_t have asked for more .
negative	after a week when my order did not arrive i contacted medicanimal and was told my order had been delivered , eventually i was told it had been delivered to the wrong_address and it would be collected and redelivered .

negative	i ordered nearly 000 prints from you and most of them have come with only half of the photo printed on it .
negative	and i wait .
neutral	you know you are backed_up by hostelworld so you are not afraid of the hostel beeing a fraud .
neutral	overall we are not too happy with the products however i know to reorder would mean paying again .
negative	ordered replacement saute pan lid at beginning of october .
negative	when the items arrived a week_later they were not fit for purpose .
neutral	i was advised that the delivery day would be confirmed my email , it was not so i was unaware of what day it was going to arrive .

negative	i am a very regular business traveller to brazil and have almost always booked both hotel and flights through_expedia . co . uk , but i won_'_t touch them again even with a barg pole .

neutral	i was reimbursed with the diffrence of next_day delivery compared to standard delivery .
positive	the whole outfit was surprisingly a really good fit - which can be difficult to find these days !
negative	i rang all numbers listed on my booking confirmation and received no answer which_resulted_in us paying 000euros in taxi_fare to the hotel .
positive	not so , but now with the corner_shop treats galore !!!!!!
negative	i thought it was sand at first !
neutral	very poor 00 hour express delivery service from parcelforce though - rugs were ordered & collected from rug_house on tuesday 00nd_april & finally arrived on monday 00th_april .
positive	great service and food .
neutral	the furniture is lovely !!
neutral	most notably this particular consultant scheduled to call and check i was still happy with the service after i had purchased the product .
negative	if i had managed to get_hold of someone from uw he would have been able to replace my meter within 0 hours .
negative	i was then kindly suggested some alternatives ( none even remotely similar and two at_least £_000 below my price range ).
positive	i will use them again if the price is right , which it was this time round . cheapest on the web and much_cheaper_than my local_stockists
negative	i called the company to explain only to be told that there was no way they were going to honour the vouchers .
positive	it pulls a lot stronger in second now and in - gear standing acceleration from 0k revs is a lot better - perfect for overtaking on the motorways without having to work the gearbox too much .
positive	hi mattress was delivered within_0days very promt .
positive	the whole_process was very simple to follow .
positive	ordered my sebo_felix rosso vaccum cleaner on saturday_afternoon and it arrived tuesday_morning !

neutral	i know she was at home because we phoned in the afternoon to congratulate_her hoping the flowers would be there .
neutral	i couldn_'_t add a photo to the card , so i went back and changed the card to one that doesn_'_t need to be personalised with a photo but there was no way to write in the card and no opportunity to review what the card said before payment .
neutral	tasty pizzas and with offers such as ' two for tuesdays ' they are more affordable than ever before .
neutral	i understand_why it is there but when it is applied to a harmless product like isogel , it is very irritating .
positive	free delivery and my orders were received within 0_days .
positive	i bought a walking_stick from them which was then stolen .
neutral	for standard or bifocal i would recommend everytime . unfortunately for now i will have to be ' ripped_off ' by the high_street .
negative	apart_from making very little sense i ' assume ' my glasses will not be delivered until the 00th .
neutral	i received my item just before christmas break , they said they would accept return after christmas as they were closed for 0_weeks .
negative	asked to call again next monday 00th_nov and if repair had not been completed a ‘ right - off investigation ’ would be initiated .
positive	temptations_direct is great for all_sorts of sexual items .

neutral	!
positive	i would recommend them without_reservation .
neutral	i phoned first thing this morning to enquire as to the status of my order and left a message for them to call me back .
negative	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn_'_t even been collected yet , it '_s been a tracking error ".
negative	chased by telephone to be told they had got lost , between eye sale and the lab .
positive	we ordered a tv_stand and it was our first time ordering from this company .
neutral	0_weeks after first using this , i '_m still_waiting for result !
positive	i did notice that the tracking section attached to my order on their website was not updated with my order or tracking_details , however the details they sent allowed_me to track my order via the couriers website , so no real problem there .
positive	the item isn_'_t yet installed , but i am sure it will be a great addition to my kitchen .
negative	the quality of the manufacture finishing also leaves something to be desired , specifically tacking threads left in , buttonholes not well finished .
positive	really pleased with all items bought and delivery was within 00_hours .
negative	steer_clear of both holidayautos and international .
neutral	this is disappointing as it is not my first order to this address and i very much needed the flowers to arrive on a specific date , so i feel it is only luck that they got there .
neutral	everyone who was an o0 customer is now jumping on our bandwagon , now that they want an iphone .
positive	ordered 00 . 00 on monday_afternoon , delivered 00 . 00 tuesday_morning .
positive	the renewal process was simple and easy .
neutral	that '_s just the biggest time management complaint that i had about the day .
negative	i will never ever ever use this company again !
neutral	supplements are big business .
neutral	we were thinking if updating our bathroom and thought we would go into our local_store to check it out .
neutral	an unnecessary hassle !
neutral	however , the delivery was not made until after 0pm .
negative	!
negative	!
negative	either way - i would have hoped for a more appropriate and helpful response from the company .
neutral	sales service was good but found that although the drivers mat was a perfect_fit for terios automatic , the rest of the mats weren_'_t the same shape as the old ones .
neutral	again today a game which is released today i haven_'_t recieved .
positive	my order arrived really quickly , really pleased and will buy from them again
neutral	i called them three_times to try and get a pickup driver , but was forced to leave my wife and luggage shivering by the roadside , whilst a warden made me drive around the block .
negative	the flowers look average and certainly not worth £_00 .
neutral	yours_faithfully
negative	i recently ordered some sheets online as they did not have any instore .

neutral	when the all in one pc arrived i was very happy with the quality for the price , the only
positive	i had previously always bought my glasses on the high_street because i wanted to be able to try the frames on first , but gd '_s free home_trial service meant i could be sure to get the right styles online .
negative	i replied to say that was not acceptable & couldn ’_t they just send me the belt ?
positive	all they needed was a few bits of info and my phone was unlocked within two_days .
neutral	i '_m not from a snowy country , and the need for winter_tyres was never explained to me by alamo or anyone_else .
negative	whilst trying to chase up i encountered numerous log on issues with the tyre_leader website .
neutral	i '_ve only tried the lamb casserole as yet .
neutral	flowers lovely just delivered on the wrong day !
positive	the order was delivered next_day .
neutral	the products and the service was fine but , there always is a but and the but is , that if i had ordered my products directly from toolandfix i could of saved a few_pounds because they include the delivery costs in the ebay prices but not on their own website .
neutral	for the holland in 0 day tour i was disappointed because although we visited three major cities we only drove through them .
positive	this is the first time i had ordered on line , it could not have been any easier , i was kept_informed all along as to delivery times , my aunt was very pleased with the flower_arrangement , i would recommend this very high class company .

positive	if you ' re not using quidco , you ' re missing out on decent savings .
positive	for the rear passengers to be able to listen to any music , the volume has to be excessively loud in the front .
positive	fast efficient delivery .
negative	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
neutral	that said , very little has ever been returnred to any of them !
negative	0 . ensure you balance the stage payments in your favour .
neutral	went_onto facebook and no updates this year , which raises further concerns .
negative	finally , or so i thought , they closed their mediation process and found in my favour and stated ' the customer review has_been activated '.
positive	dewalt_cordless_drill exactly as_described and delivered first thing next working day - as promised .
positive	would recommend this .
positive	all in all a very good company to deal with .
neutral	unfortunately the parcel was wrapped in brown_paper and was delivered early on saturday_morning - it had been dropped over a 0ft high gate onto wet concrete and when we found it the brown_paper was wet and the cardboard over the tubes of toothpaste were also wet .
negative	i had pre_- booked online via resorthoppa . com .
negative	paid for next_day and two_weeks_later are still to arrive
neutral	although the order arrived within the delivery timescale i think the delivery options are too long .
positive	thankyou
positive	the airram seems to pick_up well .
positive	of all the places i '_ve searched for good quality furniture at a reasonable price , pine_solutions is the best , after my brother and sister recommended the site to me i am now on to my third purchase .
negative	0 .
neutral	i would need a lot of convincing to use this company again
neutral	as i paid for fast delivery - £ 0 . 00 - i ended_up paying far more than had i bought directly from the party shop .
negative	i am greatly disapointed and un neverd as to how this is possible from a massive store as yorselves .
positive	sooo gorgeous !
neutral	her address is 00 cambridge road , about half way up the road on the left . luckily the neighbours up the hill notified her so she was able to collect them .
neutral	i would not normally comment on an issue that was resolved with myself and a retailer of anything - but , as the world seems to be " wired in " to pass comment on every tiny aspect of their existence nowadays = this " like " or " dislike " kack people seem to live by ( highly sad in my book ) : - my opinion =
negative	then what made it realy funny was i got a email at around 00pm at night saying your delivery will be here today between 00 . 00am - 00 . 00pm .
neutral	still , not bad but very frustrating when you are relying on a promised turnaround time .
positive	excellent choice of pens and super quick delivery .
positive	i have been using just_kampers for several_years_now , keeping my trusty t0 . 0 on the road .
positive	i booked our round the world trip for 0000 and have been watching hotels deals for months via various_websites .
neutral	the flowers i ordered from you on thursday where delivered yesterday and she said they are beautiful .
neutral	ordered a tennis_elbow strap , very easy process and easy to transact .
negative	if a company does not state which carrier they use then i assume it '_s because they are embarrassed to admit they use yodel and again i won_'_t use them .
neutral	i was charged € 00 (£_00 ) for a full_tank of fuel in a smart 000 - however as i own the same vehicle at home i know it only take £_00 max an over change of £_00
negative	00_minutes later i received an_email_saying that the tickets had been brought and the funds were leaving my account !!
neutral	i showed up on the day and although the whole waiting time took about 0 . 0 hours or so ( not really sure why you have to wait so long ) the procedure itself was done in less_than 00_mins .
positive	cons .
neutral	it arrived on the tuesday with no apology .
negative	the edges of the fabric was " frayed ".
negative	i received no call .
negative	do not go with this company ever
negative	he eventually came out with no apologises .
positive	brilliant service all_round , our son is so pleased with his ultra_thin laptop for uni . company highly_recommended .
negative	after being notified of the wowcher_code i attempted to order the goods via the link given and on each_occassion the code was not recognised .
negative	she eventually offered me 0 alternatives , all of which were horrible and obviously all they had left , and i was told that if i chose one any more_expensive i would have to pay the difference .
negative	the reason being is that he was refusing to drive the cabinet round the back of the house , even_though he was politely asked to do so .
positive	items turned_up super quick , were the cheapest i could_find online , and when i needs to refund it was a simple process and hassle_free .
positive	this suppler provides a fast and ost effecitive serives .
positive	i ordered on thursday and my purchase arrived at 0 . 00 the following_morning .
negative	however , they were wilting on arrival and only fit for the bin after 0 or 0_days .
positive	it was out of stock , but they were excellent in keeping_me updated and responding to emails .
neutral	i also put a promo_code which was accepted but on confirming my order it then disappeared and i didn_'_t get my free items .
negative	then next moring again i called and she said that she have not got received any email and there is no record that i rang and spoke to anyone .
positive	great prices for tyres and easy to use web_site , give it a click !
positive	best buy ever !
negative	please_please_please i implore you … give these_guys a wide_berth and go with well_known booking agents such as expedia , thomas_cook , trivago … anyone would be an improvement !
positive	customer loyalty_discounts which are a great little bonus !
positive	keith_stringer was so helpful with going over options of equity_release .
negative	unfortunately this is why companies go out of business as people will vote with their wallets , if you can '_t get valentines right then what about normal days , this rush for today had to be planned by a company in advance but from reading the reviews here you obviously didn_'_t plan very well for today .
neutral	i also asked if physique was easy to find and was told , " not really .
negative	and by 00 noon nothing had arrived .
positive	imac is working_perfectly with new memory and it was kingston branded too ( i presumed it would be unbranded or a poorer name but no ).
negative	i agree this company should be featured on rogue_traders .
positive	the whole_process was very professional - from order taking to delivery .
positive	you have kept me informed all the way through , from ordering , despatch & delivery .
positive	i placed my order in the evening and received it by ups 0 working day later !
negative	will i use this company again ?
negative	she won_'_t for much longer as she was silly enough to take their lower level wallet card so she could top up on the run .
neutral	not a brilliant customer service experience but the flowers were all in tact and very good .
negative	as they said it isn_’_t their responsibility !
neutral	once i discovered this it made all the difference .
neutral	paperwork should be clear about this including reminders of what to bring .
negative	we have emailed notification of change of tenancy numerous_times , sent letters and made phone_calls .
positive	thank_you
negative	again i called and pretty_much started the proceedings again .
neutral	have used national before and always had excellent service .
negative	prices were more than reasonable , products were good quality and despatch / delivery was quick .
positive	my son was so excited to choose the colour he wanted himself & when it arrived there was no stopping him putting it straight on .
neutral	only_disappointment was the pool , it was not heated , we asked three_times for someone to fix this and three_times someone came out , it seemed to bit a problem and they apologised but that didn_'_t make up for the fact we couldn_'_t use the pool as it was freezing !
neutral	phone_call 00 . 00 to advise delivery 0 - 0 , and duly_arrived 0 . 00 .
positive	this company is excellent delivery is quick communication is good ,, staff are polite and friendly on the phone and even returns are easy with e . mail notification being sent as soon as your parcel arrives back with them .
negative	this went on for a week when i took them back and took the manager of the shop that i would like a refund .
negative	we had high_hopes for the service from internet_gardener and have unfortunately been let_down on this occasion .
positive	just like ron seal !
negative	i have had to send in copys of my tenancy_agreement and also covering_letters and was told somebody would get in touch but still nothing has_been resolved .
negative	didn_'_t get timely response .
neutral	just returned from a good week in alpe d ; where we rented 0 pairs of skiis and two_pairs of boots from olivier sports via snobrainer .
neutral	surely as a repeat_customer i should be offered the best price , my having to start as anew customer again seems to me to be a waste of time , multitrip are not being honest with repeat_customers as new customers get better deals .
negative	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
neutral	my treatment went_ahead june_0000 , i paid for the middle package , and from the start the staff were brilliant . the procedure was great and talked through it and put at ease throughout . no_problems . but after 0 months my nightime vision resembles the cheapest package . loads of stars and glares and very very poor vision . i have been told to wait til january . but everytime i drive at night i put myself and others at risk . i cannot read signs and everything is as if it is as blurred when my glasses were off . not the treatment i expected and everyone seems to ignore my plight and i have been told throughout to let my eyes settle_down . not the end_result i expected to be honest . so very very dissapointed .
positive	etyres fitter was fantastic , gave great advice and worked fast and efficiently , right outside my front_door .
neutral	the girls there were so grumpy i could not wait to get out of there .
negative	i accept my handset was not brand_new hence_why i received a " used " quote .
neutral	i rang first thing in the morning to chase_up my email .
negative	it '_s no good telling watchdog and the press that there are no_problems everything is fine .
neutral	however , this second time i received an order the driver was quite_abrupt .
negative	i '_m_sure most people have another spare £_000 on a second order , don_'_t they ?
neutral	i am sure you know that there is a lot to be done to improve the ' looks of the facilities ' . you will get there for sure ( i hope )
negative	dale
positive	i would recommend ' glasses0 you '
neutral	good '_s were out of stock but they emailed me to let_me know .
negative	are you serious ???!!
neutral	i checked the site and discovered the shape ( path ) was no_longer available to order .
neutral	al principio el_precio parece muy barato pero cuando te empiezan a cobrar todo a parte ya no lo es tanto .
negative	i have two jobs to try and make ends_meet .
negative	however , when i went through to check out , shipping was about £ 0 with an estimated delivery date about a week_later .
positive	bought a tnf fleece for £_00 !!!
negative	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .
neutral	i mean , i never watch those videos , and i bet no one else does either , but it takes nearly 00_minutes to earn 0 swagbucks by ' watching ' them , and 000 = £ 0 .
negative	the lesson for anybody reading this is do not go to optical_express even if you have to use their toilets .
negative	in fact a spray didn_'_t get delivered - a bunch of wilted chrysanths did and they looked like they '_d cost a couple of pounds and been sitting on a garage_forecourt for a week .
negative	very disappointing inthe service , i will have to go to the vets tomorrow to collect some more which is additional time and money that is not acceptable .
neutral	after the product failed to arrive i contacted the company twice to be informed the courier had lost it and another one would be dispatched .
negative	ah not as easy as that , it will now take 00_hours . and so on it went . being_fobbed_off and continuously asked if id like to make a desposit and they would give me another bonus ?
negative	my bed never turned_up despite this company saying theyd deliver it on three different occasions !
positive	delivery was quick and the website has good size pictures so i new exactly_what i was buying .
negative	wtf . not impressed , in fact really disappointed
neutral	i have a strong prescription so paid_extra for think lenses .
positive	thanks .
negative	contracted ecologicliving ( carlisle ) to provide 0 seperate biomass systems ( both ' turn key ').
positive	order arrived very promptly .
positive	firstly , the custmer service received was excellent .
positive	very quick , efficient , helpful service .
positive	delivery service was very prompt .
positive	arrived first thing wednesday_morning .
neutral	0 .
positive	my good did indeed turn_up on time and in good condition .
positive	cheap to book with and there were no_problems .
negative	in my case after_contacting anyvan , they refused to intervene , were vague about how vendors were accredited and admitted that a vendor could indicate that they had goods in transit insurance - on their website - without anyvan even seeing any documentation to prove it .
neutral	0 . delivery date
negative	they are much more_expensive than specsavers but offer no customer service , no personal fitting and the glasses took two_weeks to make - only after complaining_about where my glasses were did they agree to send them out .
negative	dear_sirs ,
positive	good deal after a bit of haggling .
positive	definitely would recommend
negative	i want to warn_people about mk exhibition based in milton_keynes , as i have been the victim of the director '_s previous company house0market . co . uk and he has left me £_000 out of pocket .
positive	searched around for the best price and this was it by far and then uber impressed with the quick and ' free ' delivery - thank_you .
negative	how very poor the service is from city_link by the looks of all these reviews .
neutral	others i know in the trade have had similar_experiences .
positive	windows 00 is now reporting 000_mb of ram in my system !
positive	all were larger than i had expected and the quality and health of the trees was second to none .
negative	admittedly , the products seem to be good value for money ' on paper ' but considering i paid for my shed 00 / 00 / 00 and had 0 deliveries of various parts that still do not equate to an entire shed , then all i can say is avoid !
negative	customer service executive "
neutral	recieved the delivery on monday as instructed but i ordered my goods on thurs 00th_sept and paid the extra £ 0 for next_day delivery not knowing this would be 0 days_later !
neutral	thanks
neutral	now cinderella won_'_t go to the ball over christmas !
negative	i asked for redelivery and a refund of half the price of the flowers to compensate me .
positive	free delivery , genuine product at a low price and fantastically quick delivery - what more can i say ?
positive	product as_descibed and excellent quality , delivered very quickly .
neutral	the website is ok to a point i had difficulty in making the payment .
positive	it is also appreciated receiving emails to say order received , & order despatched .
negative	i find it unbelievable that there isn_’_t an_emergency contact point within utility_warehouse when something like this happens – the fitter who was eventually sent to replace the meter yesterday lunchtime said that he was available and on call the night before as lowie beck were aware of the situation with the substation fire .
negative	several weeks from first order !
positive	the price was good so i ordered immediately .
negative	very dissappointed .
positive	!
positive	couldn_'_t have received better service .
negative	all i want is a refund .
neutral	i was able to get the product online for less money and much sooner .
neutral	arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	your site completely fails to offer them in whatever options of pack - size there are ; and i was obliged to ring in .
neutral	" it could be you ".
positive	this company will be my regular supplier of photographic_paper , they just do it all properly .
positive	thanks very much .
neutral	i book every year a golfing holiday to spain the hotel alay appartments this year had to book 0 appartments with lowcost hols because was told none available from yourselfs !!!!
positive	placed the order & they arrived two_days_later
neutral	plus that the process for writing the gift message was time_consuming as it had ( not obvious ) character number limitations per line .
negative	it should be returned full or refuelling charges will be applied .
neutral	this is the worst aspect of their service and the one that greatly needs to improve .
positive	will_definitely be using in the future .
negative	they don_'_t have any advisers at all !
positive	i ordered a photo_book with photos i took of my friend '_s wedding .
neutral	direction wasn_'_t provided and was not happy .
negative	we had to ring trading_standards to get advice and confirmation that we were in our rights , which we were , there was a website error .
positive	had dispatch_notification at 0 . 00_pm .
neutral	only arrived today 00th_february .
negative	i '_ve been using paypal for the past 0 years , but recently i was robbed of over £_000 by a scammer on ebay .
positive	it was returned to sender and they immediately let_me know so i could give the correct details .
negative	on box a note says please knock hard i did not select that and overall was very disappointed and won_'_t be using again
neutral	!
negative	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
positive	thank_you to andrea and her colleagues at travel_nation who gave_me excellent advice regarding a forthcoming_trip and a really good price on internal_flights .
positive	and other products as well !
neutral	i am def having a moan .
negative	this is bad service .
negative	this is very poor delivery service and very disappointing .
negative	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
positive	surfdome always have top quality and deliver really quickly
neutral	however , at national they would only do the basics .
positive	beautiful flowers made easy by a couple of clicks on the internet 💐
neutral	if that ’_s not a scam then i don_’_t know what is !
negative	they still show the item being in stock .
negative	seems misleading and not very ethical .
positive	i first saw a tweed jacket like this over three years_ago at cheltenham races and have wanted one ever_since , but never been able to justify the cost .
neutral	i booked a 0 door corsa or similar what you get i what is available most times is a 0 door smaller car ?
neutral	sadly , this now will make me think_twice about ordering from them again
neutral	not lenstore faulk
positive	ordered a swing and slide set from the website .
neutral	when i ordered and paid for the flowers it said next_day delivery then suddenly 0_days_later i would not have gone ahead if i had not already paid but such a hassle to cancel and go else where .
positive	will_definately recommend .
positive	the delivery is very quick - within two_days - and the packaging is discreet .
neutral	my order was promptly converted into a despatch but the carrier manged to lose it .
neutral	delivery is often slow and items not always of the best quality .
positive	!
neutral	i '_m not even sure this is legal as per our consumer_rights , but i simply couldn_'_t be bothered with the faff of returning the thing .
negative	i then got another bill in december for 0 days standing charge and another estimated useage bill even_though i had moved out and they had the final reading .
positive	dubarry longford boots are fab .
negative	no apology , no telephone_call from the store nothing .
positive	no_complaints .
negative	yesterday my online_banking was blocked .
neutral	one other small point is that my instructions for them to be left with a neighbour if no - one was in were ignored and they were left at the front of the house .
neutral	it arrived in super - quick time , and the item is great - but £ 0 . 00 is way too much for delivery .
neutral	?
neutral	they order tyres from the wholesaler / manufacturer , and then rely_on them to arrange delivery to a third_party fitter .
neutral	donc , pas tres bonne experience commefciale ( c est le moins qu on puisse dire ) mais societe honnete et_de bonne foi , mon experience me le prouve a present .
neutral	got the wrong pair of sunglasses .
negative	please save your hard_earned_money by not going to kwik_fit !
neutral	this was very annoying .
neutral	i had hoped that they would be delivered before_lunch_time being as they left the depot a 0am .
neutral	dpd the couriers tried to deliver to the wrong street address and would not attempt delivery on day despite their mistake .
neutral	make it clear !!!
positive	thanks again
neutral	hvis det_er tilfældet , skal jeg lige have vendt det med mastercard , for det_er bestemt ikke i orden ?
positive	we live in spain , so we were a little_concerned_about delivery .
positive	i will be using this company again .
neutral	be careful , be very careful .
neutral	i have sent this back but i haven_'_t had a reply as yet !
negative	contacted them on the same day , however their rude and arrogant customer service even refused for the refund .
neutral	probably shouldn_'_t have accepted the wheels but thought i could fix .
neutral	great staff and car but the devil is in the details .
positive	i had chosen the machines based on the low running cost for the toner_cartridges and the support offer of three years on site next_day service if the printer should develop a problem .
neutral	ive found the signal to be always good but the tariffs arent the best around
negative	kind_regards
negative	i am now avoiding all companies that use yodel as a form of delivery !
positive	staff really helpful and friendly too .
positive	on the return we had not received a text on our mobile but the office had e_- mailed the reception at our hotel telling us the estimated time of pick_up .
neutral	the cost of postage was excessive for a light product
positive	the item arrived very quickly and my daughter absolutely_loved it .
negative	spoke to prestige_flowers today , they were apologetic , but referred me to their terms and conditions that state they cannot guarantee next_day delivery .
negative	i received them in the post and immediately noticed a two holes in the leggings when i tired them on .
neutral	panicked until it swore in english .
neutral	having read all these great reviews i was expecting to be impressed .
neutral	i am still_waiting .
positive	the website was very well_laid_out , organised and easy to use .
neutral	bought these two blinds , price was comparable to other_websites , arrived on time , easy to install , but no instructions in package , had to ring up for them to send me via my email address , again instructions clear apart_from the fitting of the valance , the diagram for the front clips that clip over the frame edge could be clearer as the diagram showing this is not very good , and the description of how to fit is not very clear , apart_from that everything was ok .
positive	would definitely use again
negative	so this makes it hit - and - miss as to whether you will be home on their first delivery attempt .
positive	highly_recommend mazuma
positive	price and quality as i said is second to none !
positive	maybe some testers would be good .
neutral	they will not pay for return postage .
positive	honestly i was sketchy at first , but the order was quick , simple and perfect , got my game & currently playing , excellent service !
negative	friday 00th_oct - called to request repair - computer saying that hard_drive was about to fail .
neutral	first of all specialtech seem to be decent but il go over pros and cons
negative	i hadn_'_t ordered anything in months .
neutral	whilst it was the cheapest tape on the website , it certainly hasn_'_t been value for money as it began to peel away from my shoulder almost_immediately after application .
positive	booklet should be larger than a0 and printed on heavier paper in bolder type for easier quicker reference .
negative	i ordered a new apple_iphone_0s on t - mobile contract .
negative	for some reason ( i '_ll probably never find out in this lifetime ), they could not port my existing number across so they cancelled the tv engineer '_s visit .
positive	i can highly_recommend this company
positive	i live in portugal and had a problem with my keyboard , i flew it back to them and they got me a new one dispatched straight to my uk address on christmas_eve ( amazing ) and ready in time for gigs over the new year !
positive	i had sent the wrong prescription but glasses_direct very kindly re - made to the new specification without charge .
positive	i always check prices with the competition before ordering .
negative	i had a problem where my order was rejected - the reason being that it was too far ( if you could say 0 mile was too far !)
negative	so i gave it an extra day before contacting them .
negative	******** update *********
neutral	my reservation is in relation to the mark - up from the actual ticket price - which was almost_double .
negative	the only_reason you have one star is that a lovely girl called rosie very kindly arranged to have our package redelivered in lucy '_s absence and was very friendly and helpful .
neutral	was very disapointed in service .
positive	thanks again :)
negative	hello
neutral	i have just purchased a 00cm swiss gym_ball with free footpump .
negative	am now going to have to write to the company i stead as they seem determined not to be contactable by phone !
negative	but i was totally in the dark about what was happening .
positive	excellent service and excellent products
positive	fab .
negative	when i asked him how i was supposed to do it , he shrugged and said " not my problem as it '_s not something i have to do ".
positive	sunglasses_shop , caught my attention for being well_layed_out & providing clear information & costs for the product i was looking for .
negative	i will not use again until the site is improved .
positive	i was a loyal_customer to another well_known online adult retailer but have been looking elsewhere since they stopped offering free delivery on any order amount and only applying it to orders of £_00 +, having paying for batteries of which i think should automatically come with a toy if it needs it ( either from the manufacturer of the toy or the retailer selling them ) and a few unsatisfactory customer service enquiries that have been less_than useful .
negative	however , after i was no_longer a customer , i was still receiving marketing emails and emails reminding_me about payment for services i had terminated a long time ago .
negative	i ordered flowers choc balloon and vase & card , on the wednesday before mothers_day , so i got a e_- mail saying we have had delivered the flowers , so i was very surprised when i called my mum on sunday saying she had nothing from me .
negative	the representative was very polite when i finally got through , though he did seem slightly_embarrassed on behalf of m & s , and i don_'_t blame him .
positive	kevin
positive	i keep buying from brandoso - and keep looking - because the quality of its shoes and boots are fantastic .
neutral	please make these changes to your fees .
neutral	our worktops however took nearly 00 weeks to reach us !!!
neutral	doubt we will use your service again .
positive	fast and efficient service offered through the chat_window and saved my time from sitting listening to hold - music !
negative	if you choose chess they will overcharge you , they will ignore your emails and when you choose to leave they will_continue to bill you and threaten you .
neutral	i have 0 young_children and needed the sideboard in place when they came back from nursery so had to remove from the packaging and manoeuvre onto its feet on my own !
negative	they still have my money !
negative	i had too explain the whole situation once again to mr mike norbury . he kept telling us to just take our shopping and use the e_- vouchers off our next shop as there was nothing else he could do .
neutral	i '_m loosing weight which is what it '_s about , but before signing_up to the 00 week plan i called and asked general questions about the diet and if there would be any offers coming up .
neutral	needless to say , though , i was a little dissapointed .
negative	avoid , avoid !
positive	a great team arrived with the sofa , and were most accommodating in getting it into it '_s situation in the basement of the house .
positive	i will be definately buying from these_guys again .
neutral	they would chase it and ring me back by 0am the next_day without_fail .
negative	not only have i been lied to over unlocking my iphone_0s at the end of a 0 year contract they are now chasing me with menaces for £_00 . 00 unlocking fee service that was never provided and i still have my iphone which is locked and useless .
negative	i booked this service and arranged collection between_0am and 0pm no one turned_up to collect my parcel .
negative	and you '_ll have to pay return postage even_though their t &_cs say otherwise - and even if the dvd they send is out of date - and you have to download it anyway .
neutral	i '_m finding .
negative	a further two letters , both recorded delivery and both signed for by soho00 at their listed address but no response .
neutral	after 0 days the pc developed a fault ( no fault of box . co . uk ), collection was arranged for the next working day .
neutral	however as soon as the company got the business they weren_'_t really interested in providing any further customer service .
negative	it also still says the tickets are not available . they also told me that the tickets were from a 0rd_party seller and that they have to contact them to get my money back which is absolute lies because the third_party seller does not receive the money for the tickets until 0_days after the event !
neutral	+ clear pricing
neutral	i placed 0 separate_orders and each order arrived with too few envelopes , and i expected after having spent a lot of money on orders these to be provided
neutral	it would have been helpful to have had car_park staff to direct us . we waited 00_mins for a bus , so in total it proved to be a time_consuming and rather anxiety provoking experience .
negative	i '_ll wait the week for you to get it back into stock , and spend the day i wrote off to wait in for the delivery publishing my experience with your company on - line , if thats ok with you ?
positive	twenty two and a half hours from ' click ' to ' bing - bong '!
neutral	the website and range of available boxes were brilliant and i quickly chose exactly_what i needed .
neutral	no problem with inter_city courier , great delivery on time , or tribal_uk , easy to deal with , would never order from hughes electrical '_s ( ipswich ) again ), poor customer service in my view .
negative	det kostede mig to tabte arbejdsdage .
negative	as it had been some time since the account stated the item had been despatched , he sent a message via_amazon , enquiring_about delivery .
neutral	so i sent it via the standard service that states i '_m only covered for 00quid also took a long time considering it states 00 it took 0days to reach them .
neutral	however a shipping charge of £_00 . 00 is a rip_off .
positive	i have used the services of hello_canvas several_times and been very happy with the results .
neutral	we did have an issue with beanbagbazaar , but i have to say after bringing up the problem here on trustpilot , it was resolved quickly .
positive	they helped_me loads when there was a problem with the delivery of my item and they sent replacement .
positive	thanks .
neutral	oh and delivery men fill in their own feedback questionnaire and then just get you to sign it and tell you it '_s part of the paperwork that needs to be signed .
negative	it said shipping was free and the items would be ordered via_amazon '_s check - out system so i figured if amazon were involved , it was probably alright .
neutral	was also suggested to me not to ask for replacements as the order was small .
neutral	as above , website had no number to recover from lookup failures . chat stated they would resolve but didn_'_t !
neutral	well a tale of two properties here .
positive	i ordered my new phone from hand technology on saturday and had it on tuesday_lunch time .
positive	the very reason i went on - line .
neutral	overall i like this company will update my review at a later date .
positive	i booked yodel through p0g - they are useless and didn_'_t turn_up .
negative	there is no tracking_system available to use which makes this even worse .
neutral	it took him 00_minutes and a bit of foot stomping before he came away with my order .
negative	got an email bounce due to some shoddy forwarding they use
neutral	the jigsaw it self was ok , but the box it came in didn_'_t have my picture on the front !
positive	first time i have used ld_mountain centre but they will be my first choice in the future !
positive	i purchased some drontal_plus tablets for my dogs from petmeds on one of their free_postage days ( to test their performance before i ordered anything expensive ).
positive	they even said they would come_back asap when we thought we left my daughters ipod in the car .
neutral	i have emailed to question the whereabouts of my order with no reply as of yet .
neutral	disappointed with this as my phone was in immaculate_condition and i had followed the instructions word for word .
neutral	after thought at home , measuring and discussing we returned to the shop where we were again looked after by staff as we finalised our purchase and i paid a deposit .
positive	found a pair i wanted for a great price so ordered ; within the hour the order & subsequent shipping where confirmed & i received them the next_day !
positive	thanks very much , will_continue shopping with you !
neutral	i accepted that and received an update email_saying my item had been dispatched the day after .
positive	easy to order , attractive website , great price ,
neutral	when i checked the contents of what i had ordered no items were missing and none had managed to be damaged .
positive	we came_across round the world_experts when we were pricing a trip to the far_east .
neutral	friends of ours have stayed in your villas and been happy , but obviously for some reason you do not have the same standards in all your villas ?
positive	having not visited australia before it was good to have someone in the uk to make the booking for us .
neutral	the procedure was fine , the surgeons and opticians were the best , but i found the attitude of the people in the actual store pretty poor .
negative	i contacted the company on 0st_november for an update on delivery as it was due for delivery to be told they were not able to get_hold of the go_kart so they would refund my money .
neutral	i was ordering floor and wall_tiles .
neutral	despite this , my order still took over one week to arrive .
negative	not in a box .
negative	whilst on paper the procedure was a ' success ', as my vision has_been improved , it has now been over 00 months and i am still suffering from severe dry_eye and struggle every day as a result of this .
neutral	in the product .
positive	easy process from_start to finish and kept_updated along the way .
neutral	your customer service staff was very patient and polite .
negative	!
positive	the fit was perfect , the material was stunning and high_quality and fitting the blind was very easy .
positive	well_done guys .
negative	we emailed 000 .
positive	used the mobile fit service , which was quick , efficient and very hassle_free .
negative	i told the assistant that i would have to cancel the order in that case as i needed to order it urgently from somewhere_else and she told me that i would not receive a refund for about 00 days despite the fact that they took the payment from my account the day after i ordered it .
negative	i wrote an_email to compare my move to flag this and i never_heard_anything back .
neutral	this time my order came in batches and the main food delivery was a day late .
neutral	delivery tube , marked ` fragile ` was badly broken in two places .
positive	the final step was seamless , with clear_instructions on how to supply one '_s own prescription for the selected frames .
positive	animed_direct are absolutely_brilliant .
positive	no_problems with the service , requested a quote which arrived promptly and karen suggested an_alternative which worked out better for us .
neutral	this time i phoned the nominated fitting_centre to confirm the time only to find they had no record !
neutral	i know that people are generally opposed to change in all forms , but in facebook '_s case i think that user opposition is justified .
positive	we ordered 0 huge beanbags - a whopper and a the original .
positive	they were extremely_helpful over the phone and you were not made to feel embarrassed ordering the items over the phone , as i would ordinarily do it online this being one of the reasons .
positive	we had been concerned that our hirer was a certain locauto ( italian rental ) that has racked_up a not inconsiderable volume of complaints , some just shy of fraud .
neutral	it is rather frustrating when this happens and wastes time .
negative	!
neutral	stopped using them for food - only prescriptions now .
positive	i will_definitely use this company again .
neutral	delivery times seem longer_than i would expect
neutral	refunding me the £ 0 was a nice_touch .
positive	i had asked for a model that used the same ink as my previous printer since i had a new set of epson 000sx inks by me .
positive	the flowers lasted well and were excellently_priced .
negative	i have a linux dedicated server running fedora with fasthosts web hosting .
positive	thank_you , thank_you
positive	easy to use website too .
neutral	i '_d a lot of cds to sell but used a competitor for most of them as they offered much_better prices .
negative	i wish i had gone to john_lewis who all actually stock the same washing but £_00 cheaper !
negative	however they would only do this on the condition that i remove the review i had posted and ceased to post anymore .
positive	i found mattress online & browsed through their mattresses & thought why not , so i ordered one & it came nice & early the next_day .
neutral	the product however is great : 0 )
positive	nothing to lose .
negative	my order was pending for many days .
neutral	flowers arrived sometimes twice in one day but sweets were orderd twice for th children but havent arrived
neutral	i used this service to shift a 000kg item so i was happy to pay for this sort : d
neutral	!
negative	it seems to me to be entirely pot_luck .
negative	another phone_call to be told the part still hadn_'_t come in .
positive	the delivery is fast and the products are good value .
negative	i confirmed my wish to cancel .
neutral	card had huge mistakes due to clash with the portuguese keyboard .
negative	i now don_'_t have the box as i didn_'_t need to send it with the phone .
positive	this has to be the most excellent service i '_ve received in a very long time .
positive	very quick .
neutral	but i got over it , thankyou .
negative	i got a new one , but then my bt_vision stopped_working .
positive	item wrapped in bubble_wrap and well_packaged .
neutral	whenever i tried selecting a contact using the dial pad from the rebtel app , the number of the contact that i choosed never shows up , it always comesback with a uk phone number it can be very annoying .
neutral	on a busy bank_holiday_weekend i was lucky they still had a room available .
negative	i was also not told until after purchase that delivery could be anywhere up until 0pm .
neutral	car appeared to have clocked some mileage on return .
neutral	i rang to rearrange for the following week and was told this would be logged .
negative	i made an_alternative choice the same day .
negative	the blind is very nice but what we had to go through to get it !!!
neutral	i received a lot less_than was originally_quoted .
positive	the service was great and the item was approx .£ 00 cheaper then major shops i will buy again from yourspares again
neutral	you emailed me on a saturday at 0am telling_me i had 00_hours to collect from the locker .
neutral	meanwhile mm kept sending emails to say my ( much smaller ) package was still being_processed .
neutral	however it then cost me £ 0 to send the phone and upon orange receiving it they gave_me a price of £_000 therefore £_00 less_than the original price .
positive	would have no_problems recommending to anyone .
neutral	ok , goods ordered pm , delivery free as order was over £_00 ex / vat , arrived within_00hrs which was fine .
positive	i placed 0 orders just before christmas and the 0nd order turned_up 0st .
neutral	so why did i have to spend 00_minutes on hold to the call_centre when the re - arranged delivery was ignored and the courier obviously had no problem finding my house the following_day ?
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt on 00 / 00 /_0000
positive	excellent service all_round .
negative	finally i got in the car and was able to drive away , quite stressed after what seemed an unnecessary delay and rudeness by all involved , not a great first “ hire car experience ”.
positive	all this with the promise of a really good price .
neutral	lucky that ferries ( both_ways ) were relatively quiet , so plenty of space to sit and get around .
positive	really cheaper_than lots of other online tool retailers
negative	eventually companies that operate like this always fail .
neutral	while the 0 is great , i still don_'_t know which one is called tri - enzyme resurfacing serum 0 and 0 .
positive	i needed a replacement dimmer_switch for my kitchen .
positive	we used holiday auto to book a rental care locally .
positive	i had a fast and full response to my email .
positive	the courier emailed me the next_morning stating that i could expect delivery prior to 0pm .
neutral	either customer service has no staff or asleep as i have heard_nothing from them .
neutral	next_morning at 000am the florist called asking for the full address and so on .
neutral	i haven_'_t received the device yet .
negative	however , i subsequently received notification i had received a refund .
negative	we were kept waiting for ages perhaps this was because we purchased on line .
positive	amazed at how easy to get a better price , saved nearly 00_%_off quotes given by p_& o .
positive	i consider it great value and was delivered quickly .
neutral	fast delivery though
neutral	i order from gd 0 years_ago .
neutral	i guess i wrote this more out of anger as my gf was very upset . as it was solved quickly i can change the star_rating .
positive	this was an easy site to naigate and the batteries arrived quickly .
positive	i now have a new door_seal on my washing_machine and would definitely recommend them to others and use them again .
positive	always great service , they let you know immediately if they are out of stock , otherwise never any_problems !
neutral	no explanation , nothing . :(

positive	first time i have ordered from chemist_direct and would shop with them again .
neutral	the tent wad a quality branded product at the lowest_prices i could_find on the web but i was a bit disappointed by the very poor dpd delivery who couldn_'_t find our house .
positive	very quick delivery , kept me informed on the status of my order .
positive	after trying numerous_times to contact the local transfer company to confirm collection , i was unable to get through .
negative	phones now on its way back to me but it '_ll take 00 working_days !
negative	sad .
negative	so in summary , if i were telling this to a friend , i ' d tell them for goodness_sake , don_'_t use citylink .
positive	when it came to delivery , i happened to be out , so the delivery service took the initiative , and rather_than just going away again with the order , they left my cat_food with my neighbour , and informed me of this - all very convenient
positive	i cant buy the tape in boots or local_chemist
neutral	i did get an_apology reply when i sent the relevant links to prove the info i had .
positive	it came on wednesday as expected , perfect_condition and great quality .
positive	this is the first time i have ever ordered a roller banner .
negative	absolutely useless .
neutral	not impressed .
positive	thank_you for the wonderful service !
positive	many_thanks .
neutral	strangely , though , another email arrived the very next_morning saying they had arrived and a cheque was on its way .
negative	the forms that i ' d paid for were useless as they showed divorce - online as my legal representative .
negative	just like mike i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying wrong information .
negative	been waiting for my delivery for over a week now .
neutral	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
positive	boots were great too .
neutral	- outrageous !)
negative	i had to contact the store 0_days_later as no one had contacted me .
neutral	i have been with quidco for a couple of years_now , and although i have always been impressed with the rates of cashback they offer , the service just isn_'_t what it could be .
negative	i have attempted on seven occasions to trade books with this company .
neutral	service great and purchased items up to expectation .
neutral	they now also smell lovely , it is just a shame they were not that nice when they arrived .
negative	obviously i didn_'_t even want the washing line after that !
positive	very easy to order i would recommend this company to all my family .
neutral	on first use the free footpump , although a little flimsy , did the trick .
positive	ordered my usual speciallist shampoo and conditioner .
neutral	if you are thinking of using this printer , think_twice .
neutral	prior to this new charge , i would have given them 0_stars , in large part because it gives the flexibility to order things when you think of it , instead of waiting to build up sufficient order size .
neutral	ordered duracell aaa_rechargeable_batteries but panansonic were provided , which would have been cheaper_elsewhere .
positive	being somewhat nervous_about ordering cards online having heard plenty of horror_stories in the past i have been blown_away with how good the people at magic_madhouse are from the prompt dispatches to the really helpful sales staff i honestly cant say enough good things about them but will leave you with 0 examples . the thursday before_xmas i ordered about 00 quids_worth of cards for myself and others . couple of yugioh starter decks and a booster box . now xmas being the following wednesdayand xmas post being its usual helpful self i was fully expecting ( and would have been happy with ) a j begining of jan_0000 delivery . the very next_day my items were dispatched and the following_monday my items turned_up . thats the monday before_xmas !!!!!!!!
negative	poor description of product and doubt the top line price .
positive	james newton
negative	after ( he ) trapping my finger as i tried to help the imbecile close the box , i endured a further minute of his profanities .
negative	i was told the car would be repaired and sent the next_day . the following_day we received someone_else '_s car !!
neutral	mens range is awful though .
positive	!
positive	they arrived quickly with no_fuss .
negative	no written acknowledgement after my first two emails of complaint so no sent a third one !
negative	wow !
negative	scentiments of wibsey .
positive	great company
neutral	so my question would be , if i take my car which as a tyre tread_depth of 0mm into a nissan_chorley garage for a annual service or mot would i be advised that the tyres would need changing or not ?
negative	overall , a complete_waste of money !
neutral	this has left me short of money !!!!!
neutral	hpc may get a good deal from shipping with yodel , but they were difficult to deal with , and that ultimately i nearly returned the products as they were too late .
neutral	will attempt to use the website again .
neutral	however , when i opened the grey mail bag , i was very disappointed to discover that this item had just been shipped in its retail packaging , and not in a box .
neutral	this time i upgraded to use of rightmove and used the service for a epc which i was happy with and i love the way you can upload directly to all the sites .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	and even had the cheek to write on the invoice ' vat for credit check £_00 '!
positive	simple and easy to use custom facility .
neutral	on enquiring with jessops i was told that the package was in the hands of parcelfarce - had i known this at first , that would have been enough to make me take my custom elsewhere .
negative	order was immediately cancelled , but then i was told it would take up to 00 days for my credit_card to be refunded .
negative	my advice in a nutshell is to stick to the reputable_companies that we all know and love , and you won_'_t be disappointed .
negative	i can '_t change the priority on a disk as it then causes an error and moves all the disks to different lists .
neutral	i have not dealt_with any other shop online or otherwise to date which follows this type of policy - normally a refund is a simple affair , whether its faulty or not you can get your money back and you certainly wouldn_'_t be expected to pay the postage .
negative	do not make a purchase with them .
positive	every think went as it was supposed to .
positive	i am very careful when it comes to buying tools and equipment etc .
positive	local tile dealer was not very helpful therefore internet_search located yourselves and a few_days_later the correct tile arrived undamaged and now fitted .
negative	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number ).
positive	blimmin lovely x
negative	they sent it to me with the belt missing .
negative	since an initial good natured exchange of emails they have totally failed to respond to any enquiry by email or phone despite having taken the money for the gift over 0_weeks_ago .
negative	my conclusion - don_'_t use this company , you might save a few_pounds , but at what cost ?
positive	of sending phones off .
negative	your rubbish !
negative	delivery was very slow , i had to contact them to find out about delivery .
negative	needless to say i will never use play . com again .
positive	quick delivery
neutral	however you live and learn .
neutral	delivery is quicker_than waiting in the shop for it . i went one tuesday and they had run out of pizza bases so sent one of the staff to another dominos to borrow some !
positive	this is the first time i have bought from you and will be very happy to continue for future_purchases and also very happy to recommend you to others .
negative	basically , they don_'_t want to know .
negative	anyway i have dug my heels in and demanded that i have my refund paid back to my debit_card , and was told by tt on the 0 september that someone from the ceo dept will contact me within five working_days .
negative	the guy on the end of the phone kept telling_me no one would have said that to me if it was not the case and refused to let_me speak to a some one higher up in the company .
negative	only after a direct email to jeff bezos , the owner of amazon , was my wifes status returned to it '_s former five_star_rating .
neutral	the doors are good quality , hardware is over priced and delivery is slow , quoted me 0 - 0 working_days but took 0
neutral	please try and sort_out these problems with these shops ( ie .
positive	the meat was still really well chilled .
negative	whenvever i find out that yodel are delivering my parcel ( of which i have many ) my heart sinks .
negative	that being the front_door to my flat that you can walk up to from the street with no gates security barriers or anything .
positive	great easy to find and very helpful service , we got to choose our car and the guy gave_us bottles of water and wished us on our way , those bottles of water were much needed as we had another hours travel and no change to get any , taking back the car again was super easy and the guy again very friendly , will_definately use again
neutral	just this minute received a phone_call to say thank_you for her 00th_birthday card . when asked about a flower delivery she knew nothing .
negative	it is obvious that the company knows that they make extra income on order errors by not requesting a copy of the prescription with the order .
neutral	needless to say when they departed there was an issue and due to there haste they forgot to put a splitter in the phone connection to enable me to use the internet .
neutral	j ' espère que cela ne me portera pas préjudice lors_de_l ' embarquement ??
positive	suspect it would have been first thing in the morning if i lived in a city / town .
negative	ordered for a christmas_present and arrived with a stain .
positive	thank_you
positive	very attractive - could just as easily wear them out and about without getting odd looks !
negative	however , in the end , we had to park at the heathrow_terminal 0 business car_park , because :
neutral	the staff were friendly and helpful but the experience was ruined by the other " customers ".
positive	steve barnes
positive	purchased computer memory , great value , quick delivery , brilliant communication , thanks !
positive	a very easy site to buy from .
negative	it was covered with a flimsy piece of tissue_paper , with a thin piece of bubble_wrap over .
neutral	i told them that the delivery was expensive and that i was a little_worried , and in their own words they said they didn_'_t care .
neutral	i ordered a pair of bifocal sunglasses , wanting them for my holidays in a few weeks time .
neutral	this made the overall price of the bulbs very expensive compared with other_sites .
neutral	i got an email it had been posted friday but delivery was not on saturday as promised but on monday .
positive	the whole_experience with mazuma_mobile was so easy from getting the price to receiving the cheque , i would surely use them again should i need them and i would recommend them to anyone_else that had a phone for sale .
negative	a machine asks you what your tracking code is , which is a mixture of letters and numbers and you can have hours of ' fun ' with the voice_recognition software as it guesses what you have said .
positive	customer service was a +.
negative	i would strongly_advise anybody not to purchase from these_people as you can hardly call them a company !!
negative	response via_email ( shabir ) 00 / 00 /_0000 00 . 00 am
negative	the only good thing .
neutral	if you have no issues , you are quids in , it '_s just a risk i wouldn_'_t be prepared to take again …
neutral	how you respond to that will be what counts .
negative	a direct cut and copy from the email i received previously .
negative	the gate was locked and the flowers and vase . were on the ground crumpled and looking a mess .
positive	i '_ve_used mazuma several_times .
negative	these are the people who put all the " fitted blind " adverts in the cheap - end - of - the market magazines .
neutral	we did confirm in our online booking and again on the telephone that morning about the trailer so were very disappointed at the error .
neutral	the first arrived promptly and as_described .
negative	i don_'_t know about your car , but mine needs four tires to run , so i had no choice but to pay for it !
neutral	through no one '_s fault we had quite a lot of leaks in the storms , four windows leaked so we asked for old towels to put to mop up the water , a day later someone bought one towel , i pointed_out that we need four and he said he '_d be back , he never arrived .
positive	no waiting around , the communication was good , packaging secure , and as it was via the post_office it meant i could easily pick them up .
neutral	the lense fell out of my specs within the first day .
negative	mobile number . nothing !
neutral	surely this is a common problem that the piece of plastic required s is a standard piece of kit that should be carried by your engineers ?
positive	clearly knew his stuff in relation to different versions of the watch .
negative	unacceptable , today is my kids birthday and i have tried to phone the depot again to see if it '_s on their vehicle , but at 00 : 00 i get the response " our opening_hours are from 00 : 00 "
negative	appalling service , no follow_up at all .
positive	but within 0 minutes of my purchase was playing the game .
neutral	delivery is by parcel_force , who failed to deliver or leave a note that it had to be collected at the post_office , as i had paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery although it was post fairly fast , i still did not get it delivered as expected
negative	then we saw that they were very wilted and unattractive .
positive	the website was easy to use and the order was so straightforward .
positive	ordered strings on tuesday , they arrived on wednesday !
positive	lovely net arrived the next_day and looks fantastic !
neutral	i am not sure i will be ordering this again as there is no guarantee that i will not be disappointed yet again .
neutral	i got a lot of my information from the locl county_court .
neutral	instant reaction , emails of despatch and anticipated delivery .
positive	very good service , turned_up when said they would , driver was very helpfull .
neutral	this company has disgusting customer service i receive an email_saying my order has_been dispatched , so i take today off work to await my order , i call citylink who have stated that my order has not arrived , i then phone the drink_shop to which the receptionist who has no idea about customer service casually remarks with no hint of sympathy or regret that yea they received an email this morning and it was he fault that i had not been informed , i await my call back from a manager with great anticipation .
negative	0 uger efter fik_jeg besked_om , at lampen var kommet hjem og_jeg måtte tage derop og_så bestille en taxa hjem for at få min vare med hjem , som_jeg til at at starte med havde bedt om at få lov at få levering på og_var helt klar_til at betale , da_jeg_ikke hr andre muligheder .
negative	!
positive	so easy to order and buy
negative	would not advise using this company and how do i tell the lovely friend that sent them for christmas that they came in a split sodden cardboard_box and the flowers looked very forlorn .
positive	our furniture arrived quickly , communication was very good , and we are very pleased with our new furniture .
negative	called the customer " service " just to find out the obvious - the flight is not happening .
positive	delivered on time amd good quality
neutral	i would love to have a change of luck in the site but dont see that ever happening .
negative	i then got a reply_stating that as i hadn_'_t used the return code it would be quite possible the game would be sent back to me again !
negative	im still_waiting for it ???
positive	only_reservation would be that royal_mail is used for delivery .
neutral	try to " read between the lines " if you can and build your_own opinion .
positive	just from the customer service alone encouraged me to make my final_decision on the purchase so i would recommend this shop to people starting on their musical journey to those on a career path .
negative	after about 00 promises and emails to the sales_team no callbacks happen .
negative	i ordered supplements for my dog . in good time before they ran_out , as i live in the country and cant get to the shops . they have well ran_out now !!!
positive	i understand cartridges without integral print heads are only good for melting down and so can be disposed of through my local re - cycling centre .
neutral	it would have been nice to be informed of this before i had to make the phone_call myself .

negative	i got lulled into a false_sense of security .
positive	website very clear and easy to use , never had any_problems .
negative	did not receive delivery , spent a lot of time trying to speak to someone from serenata but they have no customer service phone number .
neutral	some items description '_s are lacking in detail and you have to google them for more info ,

negative	thank_you .
positive	after_placing my order it updated instantly with the order and then tracking_details , and i was delighted with the speed of delivery .
negative	am trying to do so again now as i write this .
neutral	i love fb and i use it constantly .
neutral	i should have purchased from another company that could have supplied .
positive	i found this service very easy to use , was an extremly quick process and i had the money in my account within 00_hours of the process !!
negative	when i confronted it about this she refused to answer and totally_ignored my continued messages .
positive	their service and delivery is excellent so i have no reservation in recommending to you .
negative	there again , with so many clicks involved maybe nectar realise that they had better tell us all - that we are still on the ' right click ' - oops sorry , was that a left click nectar ?.
negative	i am a frequent flier and seasoned teaveller and have been looking for flights for early 0000 .
neutral	further , the cap on the bottle of concentrate did not have a seal .
neutral	but after many emails and two_days_later
neutral	if the delivery performance stays around a week to ten days , then i will keep on using them .
negative	super hub is only super in name .
negative	the address was complete and any london courier would know it , failing this why did ' nt they ring me to confirm it ( they ask for your tel_number when ordering ).
positive	0nd time i have had an oil_change very impressed with the value
positive	they carry a full range of artist paints both water - based and oils , pastels , inks , crayons , pencils , charcoal etc .
negative	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !
positive	would recommend .
negative	they cannot blame the christmas_period as i ordered the product after this .
negative	their communication is absolutely atrocious . the only contact i have with them since thursday is a automated email response and the contact_numbers they have are completely_useless no one ever picks_up .
positive	this extra help made it a far better deal than the 000 on line !
positive	we have tried " doggy cds " thunder shirt , rescue remedy in his water , pet calms .
neutral	when blue_chip heard about our problem the moved fast ; we had two small dogs so the options for another property was low .

neutral	i have ghosting , star bursts and glare , all perfectly normal with a multifocal iol i '_m reassured but to be honest i '_m ever hopeful that i '_m not one of the very few who apparently never adapt . it would be such bad_luck if this were the case i '_m told .
negative	why pay express delivery , nothing express about it .
neutral	good prices , easy to use website but all let_down by very poor communication concerning progress of order and delivery .
negative	got to the garage and the tyre had , ent arrrived was then told it would be monday before it would arrive .
positive	i wanted the ease of fitting , ' like for like '.
neutral	however , the time from ordering to receiving was protracted far beyond what i expected , and they arrived the day before we left for a holiday .
neutral	i ordered the guinevere outfit which arrived within the allotted_time .
positive	all_round highly_recomended
positive	very swift return of payment .
negative	i have had to contact interparcel repeatedly , and even escalated it to their customer_services manager [_external_reference_] who has done nothing either .

positive	very pleased with the product purchased .
negative	golden had posted tickets with theater for following night .
negative	awaiting a response from you ,
negative	i called up and the lady was very unhelpful and quite_abrupt .
positive	well_worth adding to the favorite '_s .
negative	anyway , i was looking_forward to receiving my items .
negative	completely not what i ordered , and i was super annoyed because it was a birthday_gift for somebody , and i had no time to get it replaced , and had to go out on a saturday_morning to buy them another game as a replacement .
negative	i had been on the coach for 00mins by this point .
neutral	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling_regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
negative	ordered a £_00 sure turntable cartridge saturday 0rd dec delivery 0st_class royal_mail .
neutral	envelope just had royal_mail first_class on .
positive	it '_s a fantastic website with great products , for items like specialised renal_cat_food , it '_s not only the cheapest around , but you know it '_s coming from a trusted_source .
positive	i was extremenly impressed with the service i received from the genelteman who took the original order to the speed in which it was delivered .
neutral	every time i phoned she was on another call or not at her desk and i had no reply to emails .
positive	i bought a speg minus top on sale , as usual it was a fantastic price and really good quality and the delivery time was sensational . what i also like is you are sent an email to confirm they have recieved your order immediately , and are sent another email to say item has_been despatched .
negative	then 0 days ago they cut the phone line off without_any warning .
negative	so then you do , and it throws up the " shop now " button , so you click , and it throws up ( if you are lucky !)
neutral	i did not receive my product for 0_days .
negative	service , i called back and after trying to explain everything again another customer service person has cut me off .

neutral	does wat u want it too at a basic level
positive	!
negative	this is one reason_why sometimes i go off shopping at tesco for a long time .
neutral	unfortunately the second item sent was not what i ordered .
positive	the only item missing is hand_cream .
negative	unfortunately can '_t even see the matter being solved any time soon .
negative	most of this is lies as he is a director , was involved as i dealt_with him and he can_afford to start up 0 new companies , but not reimburse his customers .
negative	apparently this is not a voucher and my voucher will arrive in the next 00_hours otherwise i can email somewhere .
neutral	i then get told over the phone it is 0 days .
neutral	if these sorts of issues could be ironed_out then i would have given a higher rating as i love the products .
negative	avoid if you can people , there are other choices that treat you like a valued_customer , not an_idiot
positive	he also is really pleased with the products supplied and fitted and will also recommend to friends and family .
positive	i ( like many others ) have done the legwork for you .

positive	!
negative	flowers were brown on delivery , poor customer service .
negative	i '_m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won_'_t pay the price that the phone is worth !
positive	i would definitely buy again .
neutral	next time i would prefer to work through a travel_agent and direct payments .
negative	i will never use expedia . com again .
negative	due to this i had to wait for the product to arrive from france , only to refuse it and send it back - a waste of everyones time .
negative	( this should be their job )
neutral	didn_'_t receive an email next_day so emailed them enquiring as to when my order would be dispatched as i needed it for a client .
positive	never_regretted any single purchase from wiggle .
neutral	after an ' investigation ' it turns_out they had no stock .
negative	!
negative	several booked flights were cancelled due to bad_weather .
negative	update_: the day after this feedback was left at trustpilot , supapefume gave_me a full_refund .
positive	kept up to date right up to the actual delivery .
negative	!
neutral	i '_ve still not received a refund for the extra postage they robbed me of .
negative	i got through yesterday , but this time their system was down .
positive	!
neutral	good usually but it would be helpful if orders are cancelled to know and toknow why .
negative	no apology , no recognition of the absolute hassle or the fact their food is dirty and not washed properly .
neutral	ordered a polisher from them , they contacted me saying the order has_been cancelled , phoned them up to find out why , but they said it may not go through as i have missed the next_day delivery slot .
neutral	i had also change the car_registration .

positive	delivered next business day .
neutral	once received will be well happy x
neutral	the ts_&_cs don_'_t seem to onerous .
positive	great service and will use again .
neutral	as above .
neutral	however i was not worried too much as it was a small item which my neighbours could take in without hassle if i was unable .
negative	you ask to leave and only then do you get the problem sorted .
positive	the kits and equipment they stock are of the highest_standards but you get what you pay for . a £_00 beer kit will produce better beer than a £_00 kit .
positive	xx
negative	perfect example of a company that will do as little as possible and then hide_behind there terms and conditions .
positive	:)
negative	the flowers were not delivered on the 0th .
negative	at this point i raised a complaint with ofcom about being mis_- sold and sent an email to the ceo '_s office at vm .
neutral	i expect 00 or 00_hours tops .
neutral	to be fair , they were very good at dealing_with a return .
neutral	ok both were fairly heavy but i regard the delivery charge as very expensive !
positive	one star for the product - abysmal performance in respect of delivery .
negative	shame on you review centre !!!
positive	great packaging .
negative	i have phoned 0 times_now , ( calls are to switzerland ) each time i am told the refund is being_processed .
positive	have used before , and will use again .
neutral	i was very concerned_about the size of the mattress and if it would fit in the car so emailed you .

negative	explained entire situation again to a new agent who again sympathised , again recognised their mistake , again apologised and said he would pass us to credit control now to sort once and for all .
negative	only one of the items have arrived and having tried to contact chemist - 0 - u about the outstanding one they havent responded .
neutral	never had that before in all my dealings in buying items !
positive	can only recommend , good price and quick delivery and beautiful flower as !
neutral	i appreciate electronic communication gets rid of the pesky customer but sometimes a conversation is needed .
positive	i was dealing_with a lady .
neutral	as i received a text prior i could arrange for somebody to poppy their house to receive the flowers but i shouldn_'_t have had to do this .
neutral	i tried to pay by pay_pal 0 times and it wouldnt process emptying the basket each time , so had to use visa_card ,
negative	i rang walls and floors on friday 00 / 0 / 00 who informed me that it was wrongly sent to birmingham but i would get it on monday 00 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	i '_ve_used liberette for a few_years_now .
neutral	when i spoke to the delivery driver about this he was very of hand about it saying it wasn_'_t his problem and quickly got back in his_van and drove_away .
neutral	i just wanted to reduce the order a little .
neutral	i do not know if the operators are direct employees of rte or free - lancers acting as agents , but i get he feeling the service depends on who answers the inquiry .
positive	i ' d looked them up on various review sites before buying and we are pleased with the quality of sound .
negative	if you '_d like an idea as to how unethical , unreliable and untrustworthy this site is , a site which is ironically called trustpilot ( a classic example of orwellian doublespeak in practice ), simply compare the trustpilot ratings and reviews for electricshop with those on reputable , bona_fide independent_review sites like reviewcentre . com ; the former are whitewashed and glowing , the latter largely negative and scathing - which pretty_much reflects my personal experience .
neutral	i cannot_rate highly_enough the quality of the kitchen , great value for money and i am really pleased with the overall result .
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered on valentines_day - they were not .
neutral	not available to me as an existing customer .

positive	!
negative	i '_ve bought gear from them before and they were ok but " it '_s all over now baby blue ".
negative	i was told it was in stock and there wouldn_'_t be any problem .
neutral	i eventually bought my new line0 hd000 foot_pedal from dawsons after several weeks researching prices and availability .
negative	i ’_m defo not a happy shopper maybe time to change provider i ’_m sick of no apologises and the fact the mess up so often .
positive	0st rate company and 0st rate service and glasses .
neutral	basically , i only recieved the masks by a massive stroke of luck , i . e .
neutral	for me it '_s not worthwhile spending all that time and then still not able to register enough to make a minimum transaction .
neutral	i did ask for a discount as i had to get someone to be available for another day to accept the order but this was declined which i did not think was good customer service .
negative	they said they would unlock it for a charge of £_00 . 00 which i reluctantly_agreed .
negative	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
positive	postage_costs were very reasonable at £ 0 . 00 compared to other_websites .
negative	they could not get the part freed .
neutral	the best before date , however , on all the cartons was only for 0 months , which i have never_experienced from other_sellers for this product .
negative	( telephoning was not an option as whenever i called i was always 0th in the queue ).
negative	if i wanted the tiles collected the fee would be over £_00 . 00 !
negative	finally we managed to get them to connect to our local sub station giving us the correct area code , yay we had a phone line !
positive	thrilled with the superb fitting of boot_liner , bumper and rear_seat protection flap for my audi q0 .
neutral	this does not match the really strong flavours offered by nespresso
negative	marcos
positive	after_searching the internet for a dualit_toaster , this website was by far the most competitive in terms of price .
neutral	took some time to come .
negative	i think a dis_- honest way of keeping customers trapped when raising prices !
neutral	after 00hrs i made enquiries , had to wait for on - line staff the next_day only to be told that the item was discontinued .
neutral	free bumper bulb collection received in good order and planted .
positive	it was delivered within a few_days of ordering .
negative	was ignored and sent another on sunday and still_waiting reply .
neutral	my mistake so nothing i can do now but frustrating .
negative	this company are worse than terrible to deal with .
negative	the advert says free next - day delivery , but when you do the order , it isn_'_t free .
neutral	the prices offered aren_'_t amazing , but neither did i expect them to be , so no real issues there either .
positive	well pleased with the products along with great service .
positive	money well spent on a product that really works .
negative	thats just what i thought the last time i had to go . only because it was still open .
positive	i needed a replacement pair of crocs cleo sandals after someone '_s dog_chewed mine .

neutral	d ' où mon inquiétude .
negative	i have cancelled it before its been dispatched !"
negative	then what happened - i got an_email on the thursday to say my tickets had been dispatched !
neutral	* update * it has_been sorted , they said the old box was used by_accident .
negative	purchased a tablet from this company and had to return for repair , so far so good .
neutral	font_size is probably about four ( non - bold ) and green lettering on a yellow background ( for instance ) gives poor contrast .
negative	i have sent iflorist a further 0 emails and tried_phoning but have had no response on any front .
positive	for me , taunton_leisure is such a company .
neutral	either they peel away ( maybe iron not hot enough ?)
positive	would we recommend them ?
positive	i phoned for some information_regarding the product and they were very helpful .
neutral	received email with tracking_number stating goods had been despatched .
positive	kept_informed all the way along with progress
positive	it was an easy to use website which was very efficient and good value .
positive	fast , efficient service and goods as_described .
neutral	they checked with the hotel and the parking company that they had the right info and then emailed me to confirm .
positive	after_searching several websites , found best price at tyreleader .
positive	very pleased with all_aspects of the company .
negative	after writing them a letter of complaint they offered me a settlement of and extra £_00 to be credited to my account .
neutral	there was no follow_up email and no delivery info .
positive	ordered on a wednesday and received on the friday in time for my party on the saturday , costume way above my expectations , loads of comments on saturday_night , went down a treat and scared the life out of people .
neutral	having booked and paid in_advance online for a better deal we yet again were held up on leaving by the ticket machine requesting we pay full price .
neutral	it would be something to consider if i did order from jessops_photo again !
negative	anyway the company is always slow with delivery took them 0_days to get back to me when i emailed them asking where a parcel was .
neutral	picture nice and clear but , surprised when i got it to find it didn_'_t fit the whole canvas , as it said it was adequate and it is not centred .
positive	very good .
negative	i won_'_t use you again
positive	i was delighted .
positive	stayed in all day on the lovely sunny saturday while my family went off to the coast , grrrrrr yes you can guess , the delivery company didn_'_t deliver , so let_down that i had ruined a whole day and with the prospect of having to wait in all day again on the coming monday .
neutral	almost every other shopping site in the uk offers free delivery , regardless of where in the uk you live .
negative	who_knows if i will ever receive anything !
negative	still nothing arrived so i emailed them again ( no contact number available and the live_chat doesn_'_t work ).
positive	i received the item 0 days_later .
neutral	the loading was fast and precise .
positive	very satisfied with service .
negative	it '_s friday_evening now and there '_s no news , is this a joke ?
neutral	didn_'_t find out until i '_d got to the end of the process that i would have to take my parcels to another location to be picked_up .
positive	easy to use web_site , had what i needed at a great price and fantastic delivery time , ordered one day received the next .
positive	just wanted to spread the word to save you money when you need yours replaced ; ) x
neutral	this website does not accept visa_debit_card which is a huge inconvenience for a young person like myself who does not have a credit_card , so i had to scramble to use somebody_else '_s .
negative	will give it until tomorrow then may well cancel and hopefully get a refund .
positive	in recomending the company .
neutral	i '_ve placed 0 orders with them , after about 0_weeks only 0 of them has tracked so have had to lodge claims for the sake of about 00p an item :
neutral	the materials used are pretty good ( especially the drivers one with the heel_pad ) but the finishing is not to the standard of the authentic honda mats .
positive	everything as expected .
neutral	the vendor also sent a garlic twist by way of apology - which is appreciated .
negative	had settee for 0_weeks and it looks 00 years old already !
neutral	unfortunately betta_living let themselves down with their service .
neutral	it would apeal to a teenage school_play ground .
positive	i would be more than happy to recommend this company and it '_s products .
positive	i bought some freeze - dried_raspberries , which are delicious and versatile .
negative	my online order worth more than £_000 , arrived in good time , but poorly packaged , dirty and damaged .
positive	cash transferred to my account straight_away .
neutral	having found a good range of tiles at very good prices and an easy to use website i chose a delivery date when i knew i would be in , when i returned from the christmas break on 00th_dec i found 0 delivery cards from 00th and 00th_dec , so then had to contact interlink for redelivery on my chosen date again , the box was in a very bad state when it arrived , it may be good sometimes to get things early but if you are asked for a specified date and no one contacts you to say any different ?
neutral	one item from the order was missing and was replaced after a couple of e_-_mails and a few_days ' delay .
neutral	at the moment i had better
negative	sellers get none .
positive	i also thought my frontline minus a box is a really good idea !
neutral	if they just royal_mail the friction would be reduced to a buttery glide .
positive	their customer service is first_rate , with emails being answered_immediately and by very helpful staff .
neutral	but would i buy from them again . no .
negative	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
neutral	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
positive	easy to book on line , fare price , brilliant access to the airport .
negative	!
negative	i stood my ground and wouldn_'_t budge , i worked in retail for a very short time and i have seen what customers do !!
negative	i '_ve had to call talktalk almost every day because they have failed to deliver on their promises .
negative	will not be using again .
negative	when she sent me a pic of the flowers that where delivered i was really disappointed .
neutral	the booking process was quicker this time but as i was booking the car for over 0_days i had to pay for a tank of diesel - luckily i used the whole tank otherwise they wouldve made money out of this .
negative	yep , a 00 - hour_window .
neutral	i thought i had changed the pick_up destination on the website but when we got to geneva , the desk had no record of my booking .
negative	i purchased my third trolley in 00 years from uk sport import ltd .
positive	thank_you .
positive	always genuine_article and arrives quickly .
neutral	when i had eventually finished my book i then placed the order and waited for the book to be uploaded - this i had to attempt 0 times as it kept freezing after only 0 minutes or so .
positive	sales_manager . aughton engineering supplies ltd . liverpool .
negative	when the day after my order arrived i was fuming .
positive	can '_t fault them .
negative	service is absolute_rubbish !
neutral	moral of the story ?
positive	genuinely recommended .
negative	these_guys have a very bad attitude_towards customers and thoroughly deserve all the bad_press that they get
neutral	they would have taken 0_weeks they said .
positive	less_than 0 hour later i had an email_stating it had been despatched ( nb i was using their free delivery service , not ' next_day ').
positive	first time i have used this site and was very satisfied with stock , prices , speed of delivery and service .
positive	the service i got was top_class i shall use serenata_flowers again im very pleased and so is my wife who the flowers were for
neutral	the product was as_described but over a week from order befor shiped and then only sent by normal mail .
neutral	the wrong item was delivered and it was a good job i checked the delivery note .
negative	to which i declined as if they cant give you their promised sign up bonus , who `_s to say you will get any bonus from these_guys ?
positive	i would ' nt_hesitate in purchasing items from charm school again in the future .
negative	when i got the flash i found out it was faulty , it wouldn_'_t turn on most of the times even with brand_new batteries .
negative	the greeting_card was small and lacked imagination and a personal_touch .
positive	twice a week i use the msm_beauty scrub and the green clay face_mask - it '_s actually a pleasure to use rather_than a chore - again the scrub is lovely to massage in .
positive	they are sturdy but light enough to be carried and are proving very good value .
positive	prices are decent and they have cards from plenty of expansions .
neutral	overall repairs were great but due to phone being beyond_repair took quite long to find out and several calls from me to get updates before being_able to collect ipod and broken iphone .
neutral	regular_emails_updating progress but even when items have been approved and payment is ready to be processed there are more hoops to jump_through - verifying bank details then confirmation that payment has_been passed for processing then it takes another 0_weeks for cash to be credited .
neutral	have to say that the situation was well handled by serenata though - well_done .
positive	i will always make it my first choice in future .
neutral	was totally_ripped_off
positive	barfootathelete has the best selection of barefoot shoes out of any website i '_ve come_across , it has a nice looking & user_friendly layout .
negative	i got a new pair of shoes last_week worn them once and they fell_apart so i took then back to the havent store the manager was very ride and refused to give me my money back she could not resell them again , which of course she cant resell them they fell_apart . better custmer service needed
neutral	i will use them again but hopefully those issues have been raised and the company has learned from the mistakes .
neutral	paid for 00hr delivery and received 0 days_later what can i say is it worth chasing no i wont go back im_afraid .
negative	do not order from this company if you need your sunglasses this year !!
negative	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing .
positive	the website is clear and shows all the available flowers that i '_m able to send to my beautiful fiancee in australia .
positive	get all your musical_needs and desires from guitarguitar , the place to go !
neutral	i had to polish the handles with duraglit to get_rid of the black marks and achieve some form of clean satin shine .
positive	even when i admitted that i was wrong they were very understanding and didn_'_t expect me to pay postage .
negative	i bought these for my mother who was in hospital to cheer_up her room .
negative	and now , suddenly , within the past 00_hours , fifteen people have given this company five_stars .
positive	all the staff gave_me a positive impression of the company and i felt_confident enough to buy this item based on their opinion .
neutral	i spoke to animed and they were very apologetic ( obviously this was out of their control ) and they explained that they never usually have problems .
positive	seriously , i '_ve never lost a competition yet !
negative	what has happened to their standards ?
negative	to add_insult to injury serenata have just sent me an_email and text_message to tell me my mother '_s flowers have just been delivered to the funeral home .
positive	many other_companies could_learn a thing or 0 about customer_services from powerbody .
negative	not only did the courier turn_up on the original date , he then tried to deliver to our neighbours , who were obviously unwilling to take in such a large item .
positive	i went on to their website , which was so quick and easy , found what i wanted , ordered paid , job_done !.
positive	very pleased with the delivery and the spats .
negative	daughter had problems with boohoo . com do not touch at all spread the word to avoid theft by them !
negative	david phillips .
negative	he said he made a phone_call too head_office and has refunded the shopping too our bank accound this he did by store after telling us this was not something he could do .
neutral	one of the drink holders arrived broken but it was replaced .
positive	can '_t say anymore ,, easy quick service r grant
neutral	i am , nevertheless very pleased with my own photo_book .
positive	the two oak items we bought are beautiful , the delivery was on time and expertly done . will be buying more furniture from them soon ,
negative	lesson_learnt about buying from viagogo - will never do it again .
neutral	very pleasant lady in customer_services was helpful but still they managed to send the wring thing .
negative	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
negative	after a lot of time trying to get some help , i was told they treat all customers exactly the same . which was not encouraging !
negative	the tyres were due to be delivered and put on at my house , the first delivery was cancelled , then the second day ( agreed by myself ) noone phoned to confirm they were coming , and no tyres showed up .
negative	once we bought the car , we soon found out this car had been in an accident at the front and back and had airbags missing !
positive	bought royal_canin at the best price online and it arrived next_day .
negative	i couldn_'_t work in my garden during the whole weekend because these people didn_'_t you their job properly .
positive	when i need any more evening wear i will be back
negative	i am now proceeding to my credit_card providers website to initiate a chargeback , before i go on to file details on formationshouse . com with hmrc '_s grey economy unit and city of london police .
negative	confirmed of course by the aforementioned female .
negative	do report them and make_sure you get your money back !
neutral	when
neutral	some times the bank connection issue can last a couple of days !
neutral	it seems the basic design of the product is poor .
positive	good delivery time and price
neutral	i referred a client ( and a good friend ) to regus for a short_term office ( this was before i was fully_aware of how regus operate ).
negative	any further censorship of my valid views could in fact be a catalyst to my further delving .
negative	bad enough you don_'_t do the job you are paid for in the first place as it is without expecting me to put myself out to that ridiculous degree .
positive	was looking for a key for a game i wanted and found this site through google .
negative	i also wonder what state the items may be in if they ever arrive having been out on the van for 0_days and now at the garage .
positive	i ordered it yesterday , it arrived this morning and i '_ve serviced the shower and it '_s now back in use again .
negative	by this point they owed me money but i am still getting daily texts and weekly letters demanding a sum of £_00 i dont owe and never have .
positive	i would recommend them to anyone
neutral	great prices , advice and delivery , but my varifocals are not that good .
positive	a company to be recommended for the high_standard of service and very competitive price .
negative	the route cause of this was that citylink had failed to update our it system with them which mean the majority of the packages we sent out would be sent to the wrong place .
neutral	we chubby / fat / obese / normal size ladies with a size 00 - 00 frame also want to look pretty and so therefore would like to see allot more choice in that size range just for a change !
positive	wageme provides you with a quick and easy application that '_s user_friendly .
negative	i have since received pushy_sales calls from the broker company which is behind moneysupermarket . com .
positive	a faulty in cartridge was replaced without_fuss
negative	response was no we can '_t do that , or meet my timescale so i instructed them to collect it a . s . a . p .
positive	the cot_bed arrived within a week , is as lovely as it looked on the website and was straightforward to assemble .
positive	arriving home we found 0 calls without messages from the same number .
negative	a few_days_later sent another e_- mail from my e_- mail account and another via my account on the site .
neutral	the clips in the holes don_'_t clip on properly so had to use old ones as these work better .
positive	probably because the service is good at a good price , you are hoisted by your own petard !
neutral	this was accepted within hours .
negative	now this is the best bit - despite us having paid for the pre00 :_00am service on that day ( and it now being past 00 :_00pm ) she said we could get the parcel there today but it would be after working hours and it was cost us £_000 . 00 !!!!!
neutral	i browsed the net and serenta were the most reasonable florist i found .
neutral	easy to compile
positive	fitting of tyres at a location and time to suit me too takes out the hassle of hanging_around and wasting my time . excellent all_round .
neutral	they managed to make a complete mess of the delivery by returning the item to cpc without explanation and the packaged was left in some obscure place at cpc .
positive	highly_recommended service , very easy to install and professional product
positive	not sure what i was expecting really but thought this was great and something i will use again in the future .
negative	despite my order being on their van all day , they didn_'_t deliver it .
negative	after waiting 00 weeks not for the refund , and after emailing them for the 00th time to find out what is going on , i just received an_email_saying they are only refunding a quarter of what they quoted .
negative	this is by far the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	she has_been without heat for a week now , they just do not care !
positive	i was trying to get a new door_seal for my zanussi washing_machine .
negative	the offers often seem too good to be true . because the are !
neutral	so sadly minus 0_stars for supplying non - uk product .
negative	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
positive	i was left_wondering_if photoworld did some " clean up " to make_sure there was no dust or scratching as many of these photos were scanned into the computer .
neutral	still_waiting .
negative	upon our dissappointment we expressed our great dissapointment in both queen '_s travel and to rickshaw_travel with no prevail .
positive	i had been advised it was the divertor valve and then the circuit_board , but it was this part that solved the fault .
positive	i would recommend
positive	the apartment was in a great position .
positive	ordered my jacket thursday_night & received it first thing on saturday_morning .
neutral	this has sadly , tarnished my experience of them .
negative	as of today , 00th_november , i still have no refund .
positive	good choice , easy to order on line , reasonable postage_charges and quick delivery .
negative	infurn e_- mailed me this week to say that they are not using dhl anymore and are using another firm , i have asked for the name of this mysterious firm and groupon or infurn are not responding .
neutral	however , the second battery purchased with the camera was an after - market copy ( not nikon ) and in - spite of its price ( not cheap ) didn_'_t work .
positive	excellent services , excellent product and excellent price !
positive	will return because i trust all individuals at this particular branch .
neutral	eventually the item was delivered to the post_office , and i went to collect it .
neutral	occasionally it just doesn_'_t work and you have wasted a capsule .
neutral	when waiting one of the staff went off to the cafe and left everyone standing so i left and did not add the other driver .
neutral	took their money anyway , as it was going to be a massive hassle getting the phone returned to me .
neutral	i am normally very happy with red_hot sunglasses in my previous_orders , but this time i am still_awaiting my item i placed the order 0 week_ago and haven_'_t had a dispatch email yet .
neutral	it was a quick and speedy service and i very happy for that .
neutral	when the online checker came up to ascertain that they were the right tablets there was no problem entering my puppy '_s weight of 0kg ( see ps for my other gripe ) and amazingly my order was accepted .
negative	thankyou
negative	items apparently arrived at depot in derby on on the 0th_april and was apparently put out for delivery on the same day .
positive	it arrived very quickly .
negative	and how come glasses_direct advertises a review from someone_who received her glasses the day after ordering them , when most of us have to wait 0 to 00 days for theirs ?
neutral	unfortunately i was out when the package was delivered and it had to be signed for , so they planned to deliver the following_day but no time given .
positive	i found this site by_accident so pleased i did , the two rugs i ordered were lovley and such good value for money with no postage to pay , that was the icing_on the cake .
neutral	the girl keeps phoning yes i '_ve got some orders to place small business but can '_t get place them until the customer is ready ,
neutral	so couldn_'_t keep in box to wrap it up
negative	i then updated my claims_form and resubmitted , as i now had confirmation on what had happened to the dolls_house
negative	so they have took my money but wont send goods .
negative	virgin_media helpline - spent 00_minutes with operator who was unable to help and so transferred me to customer service , then 00_minutes on hold before being told that customer service had closed at 0 .
negative	i continued to check the small_print which all seemed to pan out .
neutral	these were recommended as a suitable_alternative , slightly_different number from the one on the battery itself and had the advantage of being a strip of 00 , when i need 0 and have two such magnifiers .
neutral	by the time everyone had finished making their purchases we only had a half an_hour left for dinner .
negative	ordered some perfume just over two_weeks_ago and am still_waiting .
positive	hurtig_levering

positive	( i suggest possibly ordering half a size up from normal in this brand )
neutral	it was the best thing when i left bt and cheaper
negative	if you want a company that :
positive	would definitely use again and have already started to spread the word around work .
negative	alpharooms ' terms and conditions_state " once the booking is confirmed we will issue you with your invoice .
positive	the instructions for building could be more clear .
neutral	unfortunately my car failed so i was told by the lad on reception to phone back on monday and he would see if he could get the parts to do the job .

positive	firstaid0sport contacted me straight_away to inform_me the stock would be in a day later to which is was posted immediately .
negative	!
positive	printernet had the cheapest price of anywhere i had looked in stores and online and the service was not compromised by this at all .
neutral	as it happened the flight was late in boarding and my checked bag was able to be accepted through security .

negative	very poor service , would definitely by recommend and will not use again .
positive	i found the sunglasses i wanted easily on the website for a fantastic price .
positive	thank_you chemist_direct

negative	well , the staff in the orange shop couldn ’_t have been better and they were shocked at the way business phones direct had set_up my account .
positive	even_though your site has an excellent memory tool , i wanted to make_sure i ' d used it correctly and that the memory i needed was in stock ( i had an older mac ) the person i spoke to on the phone was extremely knowledgeable and helpful .
positive	i wont lie , i was a bit_skeptical beings as this was my first time using fragrance_expert and am a great believer in that if something sounds too good to be true then in probably is !
negative	we don_'_t know whether our direct_debit is sufficient to cover the charges and are worried we will receive a huge bill at some point - presuming they ever get to enter our electricity readings onto our account .

neutral	however , at times i have to turn chat off - the hosts are very variable .
neutral	so eventually i was happy and could use then again .

neutral	at_least a important is the poor positioning of the joint in the cord relative to fitting of the child safety block .
neutral	this is an_automated_message generated by steam account administration .
positive	the service was excellent with a really good idea of a ' check ' email to make_sure we were happy with the design .

neutral	i had waited 0_weeks for the order to come through and heard_nothing so i used the online_chat_facility , a very usefull_tool .
neutral	on the email_confirmation it doesn_'_t say they are being sent separately , and it says delivery within 0 working_days . called homebase / argos to arrange delivery , to be offered the 0rd_april ( it '_s the 00th mar today ).
neutral	.
positive	beat laura_ashley and john_lewis for price and quality .

neutral	i was waiting for about 0 mins each time and then there was a ring and an_automated_message_saying they were closed .

positive	most definitely will order from greenman again in the future .
positive	buy with confidence from chorley_group nissan at blackpool .
neutral	easy enough to use but some information hard to find .
negative	we were mis_- sold brightpearl on the basis that it was a product you could implement yourself without little trouble , the main_advantage with paying would be the speed in which it would be done but we could not justify_paying £_000 / per day for five days works , even_though this was given at a 00_%_discount .
negative	i will be returning on the 00th which is my day off to complain to your manager and if he is unwilling to do something about this i will happily contact the corporate line to complain with proof .
neutral	dining was not an issue as we could all be seated in either the indoor dining_area or outside on the terrace although we did get invaded by the famous canary island flies when eating outside .
neutral	delivery very slow even after i had been asked if i would accept substitutes for what was out of stock , which i declined .
neutral	next comes the ' enter phone number '.
positive	it '_s prices are very competitive and are underlain by a professional attitude to delivering its products quickly with little fuss and no bother .
positive	the staff ( including the driver ) were very courteous and the drive to and pick_up from the airport was very efficient .

negative	will no be using them again and would not recommend .
negative	recently i contacted wowcher three_times about a problem , this was over the course of a month and they never replied .
neutral	when picking the car up on arrival i was taken back to find there was additional_costs for insurance which could have been explained better on the on line booking site .
negative	i was happy with the contract while i just needed it for phoning , texting and occasionally using the internet .
positive	cannot_rate them high enough
neutral	i asked if parcelforce was still the same company as royal_mail and they confirmed this , but said it '_s not their problem .
positive	needed to return a product and there was an easy , no_quibble returns_policy .
positive	tyres supplied at an extremely competitive price (£_00 per_tyre cheaper_than my usual fitter ) and i was kept up to date with my order status throughout .
neutral	plus - delivery one item short !
positive	sent it off to them about a week_later , as it travels on land only , it took about one and half to two_weeks to get there , ( mazuma gave_me an extension on the order ).
negative	in all my refund took 0_weeks to be transferred , i nearly ended_up paying the bill of £_000 . 00 because of how bad a service they had .

negative	order 0000000
positive	gof to be tried
negative	rang worldstores and after being on hold for 00_mins on premium_rate number finally got through .
neutral	it would have been easy to improve the instructions by changing the design slightly .
negative	we sent them a drive and after the allocated time we had to contact them where they stated the item needed parts ( samsung 000gb drive £_00 at most retailers ).
negative	all in all boohoo have just added a bunch of stress on to a very stressful time .
positive	first_impressions couldn_'_t be better .

negative	!
negative	i would be very wary of them - i certainly won_'_t be using protechshop again .
neutral	the guy on the desk was really professional and i found i had got an upgrade .
negative	i tried the infurn website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
neutral	this was not the case , apparently as they use different supply companies they cannot say the cost , this should be stated clearly when you click for additional driver or if they know the cost of the car they should also know the cost of the additional driver
negative	how disappointed and sad i was the brilliant colour flowers i ordered as an additional tribute for my mother '_s funeral did not arrive .
negative	[_external_reference_] can give you an_hour time_slot with previous warning , so why can '_t yodel ??
neutral	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it '_s a very low ticket item .

neutral	i look_forward to a response from your company as i am dis - satisfied
negative	bought into the sales_pitch of 0 for 0 specs but only received one pair .

negative	i called customer service , how condescending to say " i , ll let marketing know "
neutral	the website said the furniture would be placed in the room of my choice , but the two guys who delivered it simply brought my package into the hallway and left it there .
negative	but smartbuyglasses don_'_t care so long as they have your money .
neutral	0 .
neutral	so the fault lies with the delivery company rather_than with madfun .
neutral	i then went to find the car .
positive	they checked for other items but nothing doing .
neutral	wondering_if i will see my canvas at all now .
positive	great way to get extra cash for nothing .
positive	thanks to all the staff i spoke to , everyone was so helpful .

negative	used this company many_times without to much bother .
neutral	when the cheque came my name was misspelt .
neutral	as luck would have it my previous printer was from the same manufacturer so the problem for me was solved .

neutral	price cheapest at the time , but took a week to arrive .
neutral	other than the state of the jacket i was very happy with webtogs !
positive	item despatched quicker_than_expected .
positive	ideal for those of us that aren_'_t very mobile !!!!
positive	the best way to send money for my family in spain .
negative	unacceptable !
negative	i ordered flowers to arrive at my partners work on friday i stupidly didn_'_t check delivery times although at no point in making the order online does the website clearly show delivery times .
negative	i did so , opened my parcel and it was broken in two parts .
negative	unfortunately due to the nature of our business we can sometimes be delayed and miss or be late for an_appointment , however out of over 00 000 jobs a year that we carry out , this happens with less_than 0 %.
negative	first of all the flowers we meant to be a 0st wedding_anniversary_gift for my wife to receive , the delivery came before 00 with i paid over ten_pound for this to happen as it would surprise my wife , which it did .!!!
negative	i want my money back .
negative	0_months later finally item arrives , again apart_from chris the communication has_been shocking .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i don_'_t believe you have put your customer first , and far from it , you have put your back pocket first in my case and the audacious response you have provided above is nothing short of embarrassing for you .
neutral	ordered the top as part of a birthday_present .
negative	" i have passed your message on to the department concerned and somebody will be in touch later ".
negative	i was trying to find a new shirt using their website and gave up after 00_minutes .

positive	i ordered it on the sunday , had a slight paypal issue so after not being_able to get through on the phone on the monday_morning , i clicked on the box at bottom of screen to speak with an agent and asked them to call me which they did pretty_much immediately .
positive	it took out all the hard work around finding someone to help me move house and the price and service i received from their accredited providers was excellent .
neutral	wrapping aper is great , box are ok , but they have their logo on so not very gifty .
neutral	a huge villa , great swimming_pool and gardens .
positive	i would recomment age_partnership to anyone .
neutral	would still use again though as repair was good and value for money .
negative	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
positive	the finished product exceeded my expectations , and it came quickly .
positive	great delivery service but what made a difference for my wife when buying a gift for our daughter - in - law was your excellent packaging .
negative	after numberous phone_calls to parcel_hero , i was reliably assured that they would be along on the following_day to collect .
positive	i have had bariatric surgery and depend_on an excellent protein_powder as part of my daily nutritional_needs .
negative	0 .
positive	the plastic christmas bags make ideal gift bags as they are much_stronger than the paper ones and are just as decorative with lots of different_designs .
positive	good value , good looking fridge_freezer .
neutral	it did not include the memory_foam pillow , however .
negative	odered roses pot to be delivered to my friend .

neutral	i was informed that the driver had been taken ill the day before and had missed the trunking deadline so it never got to the local_depot for delivery to me .
positive	this is really important as the ones i went for in the end were completely not the favourite ones when browsing the website .
negative	kind_regards
negative	i thought i had a good deal : first leg of the trip was british_airways which i normally book , no problem there in logging in and choosing a seat ( although the better seats were predictably blocked off for third_party customers ). on the way back i was supposed to be flying aa to chicago and iberia to london .
positive	wasn_'_t the quickest free delivery but it did arrive within the timeframe promised , so no_complaints .
positive	we ordered this item late on boxing_day and it arrived first post on 00th_december .

neutral	we had sky providing tv , internet and phone services for a few_years before recently cancelling our tv subscription .
negative	they said it wasn_'_t covered_under the warranty so i had to fork_out over £_00 for a new one , they posted it free with the manual .
negative	have phoned them 0 times and hung on and on and given up on all occasions .
negative	the chances are that you won_'_t receive them and they won_'_t answer your calls or e_-_mails .

positive	very reliable , quick delivery , i would recommend

positive	.
negative	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
negative	i should also add the small card from zazzle cost almost £ 0 to be delivered from uk , the other website cost £ 0 . 00 for a large card and fast delivery .
neutral	all in all poor customer service from all paris apartments , however saying that the end product was fabulous and very worth the money , just could have been doing without all the friction in the booking experience .
neutral	i would re - order in the future i think , if i was guaranteed from seller my order would be delivered by another courier who took delivery instructions seriously .
negative	no leaflet_enclosed so do not know how to take this product , as it states on packaging do not exceed stated usage , how can i do this when i don_'_t know what it is .

neutral	the fitting_centre contacted tyre_shopper who apparently said that the chosen tyres were not available after all and that they ' d tried to phone me .
negative	i was told to keep turning my phone on and off during the day and eventually the number will be transferred .
positive	perfect exactly_what we wanted .
neutral	i may use the service again but i would be worried of what flowers would be received after i had ordered a certain one .
positive	bookmarked their web_page !
negative	i emailed customer service ( cs ) & 0_days_later got a reply to say that even_though it was their mistake i would have to pay to send the dress back , then reorder a replacement (& pay for it ) when they received the returned item they would refund me ( within 00 days of course ).
negative	plus booking plus postage plus_vat
positive	why would any self respecting company buy all new equipment when reliable , reasonable spec ' clean computing ( for general office use ) is so cheaply available ?
neutral	on arrival at the ' first car_rental ' desk in cape_town , to collect the vehicle , i was informed i had to give them r0000 as a holding_deposit !
positive	as escapade are in my favourites_list , having bought from them before , they ' re my first and only choice for these types of products .

positive	sam_kakuji was very helpful when i was chooseing the right product thanks peter
negative	my original review :
neutral	but the item does not fit my shower_door .
negative	ended_up cancelling the whole order .
negative	i phoned his depot to complain and was told he would return and i would be given time to delete the personal_data off my phone .
neutral	her english was not great but i really felt it was better_than she pretended ( there was anorher woman there who had better english but who didn_'_t help even thought she was free for the last 00_mins ) and others may have just paid her for what they had already included in their booking .
negative	thursday received a call saying not to worry_about having to cancel the contract as the phone had not been delivered & was with royal_mail !
negative	so i waited again .
positive	very prompt and helpful reply far more so than nec !!
positive	for once , a company that promises something so good , actually delivered .
positive	this item was ordered and delivered in three_days , who could wish for better service .
negative	no complaint with the main goods and the help dept is great .
neutral	one was a delivery for a fridge ( 00000000 ) where they decided to leave a card but felt they didn_'_t have the time to bother buzzing my door .
negative	they also kept a parcel for over a month , taking it out for delivery every other day but never actually delivering .
negative	order number : 000a000000
negative	due to just moving_house there was a issue with the card , which i quickly sorted .
positive	when we are building specific , theme - based layouts , flexibility in what we can purchase and combine together is important .
positive	beautiful .
neutral	i found love holidays by searching google - and was delighted with how easy the site is to navigate , and then purchase .
neutral	returns were very responsive and instructions were easy to follow .
positive	definitely to be recommended !
negative	in overall working with santander was full of stress and i found them the most_unhelpful bank .
neutral	i ordered a canon 00 - 000l lens on 00 may 0000 (£_000 - very good value ), said to be " in stock ".
positive	super_fast delivery and great communication .
neutral	the only problem which would put me off would be as i work monday to friday i had to take the whole day off to get the machine installed as you are only texted at 0 pm the night before to tell you when the product will be able to be installed .
neutral	after a few_days i was contacted to say that due to issues with tnt losing stock they were unable to fulfill my order right now and they couldn_'_t tell me when it would be fulfilled .
negative	i have made no purchase with your company as the item was unavailable .
negative	apparently i had been emailed . i '_m still_waiting !!
neutral	the transaction fee of £ 0 , whatever the amount seems exorbitant particularly when i observe on the following_day that i never seem to have obtained as favorable an exchange_rate as the one reported ( and well below the rate for free transfers quoted by my bank lloyds_tsb
negative	i went and got an iphone 0 and now have the 0s and no issues .
positive	i recently_purchased a range of new door_handles from the website following a recommendation by a local joiner and i was very impressed at the range available and the value for money .
negative	they advised me to send it back by a freepost service .
positive	also think its a good idea that u can print_off address rather_than waiting for a bag to arrive .
negative	all i have done is give a honest review !!!
neutral	postage a little_pricey if you just want a few small items .
negative	total_waste of time using this site .
neutral	the downside was that the rod didn_'_t arrive in the time that was promised and it was quite some time after when it did eventually arrive .
positive	very good service , battery arrived the next_day after ordering
negative	don_'_t bother trying to call them .
negative	once i received confirmation it actually isn_'_t a true meet and greet .
neutral	i used this florist because they had many choices , including the one i needed .
neutral	thanks mvp
neutral	rebtel is pretty good in terms of rate and just loved the new rebtel android application .
positive	very impressive & very competitive with pricing .
positive	amazing !
negative	let '_s see how long it is to take for this refund .
positive	if you give it a try i hope you have a similar good experience
negative	when replacement would be dispatched they couldnt tell me so i asked for a refund instead i am still_waiting .
positive	i loved my experience with them and will be shopping with them all the time .
positive	the one time i received a faulty product ( not their fault ) it was replaced within 0 days , no_fuss and faultless customer service .
neutral	the product is meant to last 00 weeks , my cat is already messing right next to the product .
positive	gamola_golf has always supplied all that we need quickly , professionally and reasonably_priced .
neutral	luckily my mum being aware flowers were being delivered checked outside and there was a note put through the door saying the flowers were left on the door_step .
negative	my experience was awful and i will not trust hotel info again !
positive	great product with full instructions and a quality item
positive	you cant ask for better service and i am very pleased that i chose ipad_recycle .
negative	support email on the confirmation_email is a fake .
negative	i ordered the fitflop black boots as_described and pictured on the website .
negative	the customer service team at avis / budget were still too_busy dealing_with post rental enquiries so i was passed off to the admin team who did not contact me for another week and then did not know what my original enquiry was about so they guessed and gave_me a telephone_number to call and also suggested i ask for a discount !
positive	this company is supplied my goods on time , kept me well informed_throughout the ordering_process and the icing_on the cake is they use dpd to deliver the goods who in my opinion are currently the best delivery company out there , they even text you on the day with an eta and the drivers_name .
positive	i ordered one afternoon and the goods arrived the next_morning using amazon payments .
negative	i am now on email number 0 and 0 , same crappy generic_response and lets just say i wont_be holding my breath .
positive	i can strongly_recommend purchasing frontline for cats from petfleas . co . uk .
positive	thankyou for your speedy service , it was much_appreciated
positive	nowadays delivery times for things you buy on the internet are usually fast and efficient .
positive	easy to pick by price range or blooms .
negative	!
negative	numerous lengthy and unhelpful calls to the ' helpline ' ( i use the term very loosely ) and broken_promises of return calls from a manager later and i am done with these amateurs .
negative	i kept asking them if they are certain of that as i only have glasses for reading .
negative	so please be careful about the address you send them to , for example i wouldn_'_t send them to hospital as your friend may be discharged by the time they arrive .
positive	my new ( secondhand ) pc arrived the day after ordering ( even_tho ' i was a cheapskate and went for the free delivery option 0 - 0 working_days ).
neutral	i could of at the time of placing my deposit with iconic_watches obtained the exact_same watch from an other company guaranteed in stock albeit at a cost of £_00 more but in hindsight £_00 on a watch costing over £ 0000 would have been worth it .
positive	excellent all_round service with a quality product .
negative	this was fine , and certainly not fatal re : my travel_plans for later that day to get to casablanca .
neutral	the support from our account_manager is where we have had some bother .
negative	i urge any supplier to desist from using yodel and i will never do_business with anyone that uses them as a courier :
neutral	i am afraid in the future i will be going back to ken fraser interflora as you get more flowers for your money and arranged far more professionally .
neutral	just moved and the shower only has one bottom roller .
positive	keen_pricing - best on - line price found .
negative	its now 0pm so i ring back . com , to be told the driver had now gone home ( i was told it was stange as there was no accident or breakdown recorded ) which would have been easier to accept then just not bothering . he then apparently arrived back in store a little later with our shopping .
neutral	cab be poor compared to other nerworks
neutral	few orders placed from them never arrived due to poor courier service , however if you dint receive your goods , next will make_sure you keep waiting for good few weeks before outcome .
negative	when i explained that i didnt pay the full_amount on my bill as my account was in credit , the member of staff continued to say ( as if on loop ) that the bill was for £_000 and i didnt pay that .
negative	asked for their guidance on selecting a replacement as stock_levels low and few sizes and was just sent a link to their web_site , bikes now gone back and waiting for guidance on how to proceed .
neutral	overall not a disaster but not as good or as efficient as builders_merchants .
neutral	however , the boiler suit was poor quality and the zip_broke after a few uses in one night .
negative	the flowers were delivered one day late , today noon .
negative	q ) why not tell me from the outset that these phones were damaged ?
neutral	good value for phone , beware though as said screen was cracked and reduced price .
positive	good service online and over the telephone .
negative	ups are so bad it is barely comprehensible .
positive	i bought some headphones for my son for christmas and they arrived well_packed and very quickly .
neutral	the service was slow , three_days after_placing my order i phoned their customer service number so i could enquire_about an estimated delivery time .
positive	as it turned_out , the locauto office at palermo airport couldn_'_t have been more helpful . though i have only been back one day , i have their reassurance that my card_details are now blocked , and no money can be taken as we signed the vehicle off in full .
negative	for absolute tosh & brain dead excremental communication this is the place to go in 00_% of cases .
negative	the after sales service was non_existent .
neutral	thanks for delivering my flowers though .
positive	its been years since ive seen minitures and so many to choose from and all the bottles are glass not tacky plastic !
positive	they provided direct telephone access to the driver , so i didn_'_t need to sit in all day waiting !
neutral	expensive , and some poor quality .
neutral	i would imagine local trading_standards would have something to say about that .
neutral	i don_'_t purchase so much any more since it is not worth it any longer .
positive	i was also impressed with the service as the item was couriered the following_day .
negative	i ask what the new address is which he tells_me and it is exactly the same as the original address .
neutral	two_days_later . nothing , so i sent another e_- mail .
negative	the flowers came with a card saying ' no message required by sender ', which i was upset with thinking that there wouldn_'_t be a message if i chose not to pay for it .
negative	they said ok but they went_ahead and sent what they had .
neutral	rule 0 with smile .
positive	very , very impressed !
negative	it '_s an_absolute_joke and should be criminal .
neutral	and the delivery time for taiwan it not 0 - 0 working_days it over 0days !
neutral	my order came with 0 out of 0 handles scratched .
positive	where have you been all my life
neutral	the picture of the flowers which was meant to be the standard version portrayed the flowers to be a lot more striking and being as we paid for the biggest bouquet possible we were expecting a lot more .
positive	as soon as the email with the attached pictures arrived i knew i had to purchase the watch .
neutral	i had to do each order separately .
negative	if they offer 00p give the book to charity shops .
neutral	but for most people the tiny trays you receive can be eaten in two or three mouthfuls .
neutral	poor customer service and communication
neutral	overall , though , we think we got good service and would use loco0 again .
positive	i would recommend using bride and groom to anyone .
positive	another present for me and for more friends !!
negative	avoid !
neutral	they said
negative	since receiving your complaint regarding the ipanema copa rooms , i have contacted the property with regards to the issues you have raised .
negative	i reserved 0 child_seats but was only given one .
negative	i came_across this company as a reputable source of unlocking an i phone , i made a commitment to a friend i would unlock there phone for them , i quite happily paid the money and from then i had the most appalling service , i got an email_saying it would be done within 00_hours , made a complaint and was told it would be done soon , in the meantime 00_hours_later my friend to my embarrassment went and unlocked it on the high_street .
positive	tesco , co - op etc_.)
positive	excellent dealership , staff and service really good to deal with .
positive	excellent service - would use again and recommend .
neutral	there was an offer online but i didnt get it and customer service didnt reply to my email .
positive	ordered fibre for my dog , it only took a few_days to get here , brilliant service thank_you .
positive	very easy to order .
neutral	more experienced players that don_'_t wager huge_amounts will be disappointed at the lack of rewards .
positive	i contacted her late friday_afternoon , i had the proof back almost_immediately and order placed by end of play that day .
positive	roz
neutral	ordered an air_hockey table , with 0 / 0 days delivery , then email_explaining that due to the extra orders going through would be another couple of days .
positive	it was all very quick and easy , just how things should be !
positive	would highly_recommend .
positive	i was put through to a man called paulo who was patient with a luddite like me and listened to what i had planned and what i thought i needed .
negative	on inspection it was hard to miss the badly_damaged door .
neutral	i ordered my item , paid for it and then 0_days_later i received an_email explaining that this item wasn_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be for the next 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	if this would work on android ( maybe an app ?)
positive	the whole_process took 00_minutes and by the end a new contract was signed , he '_d sent me a copy of the termination i then posted to my current_supplier . deal done and dusted .
positive	i found so many that i liked and built several which was very easy to do then decided what one was the best .
neutral	this is a good site but not suitable for the non - technical .
positive	they sent a lot of emails so i knew where my phone was and when i would get my cheque .
neutral	when i received my order it wasn_'_t the correct batteries .
negative	the flight was unbelievably uncomfortable , i actually had a bad back from the lump , solid seemingly dark age seats they have on their planes - i know i know , its low_cost but should that really = bad quality ?
negative	site claims same day or next_day delivery .
negative	partly down to their decision to use a ticket system and offer no other form of contact !
negative	despite chasing them several_times it eventually turned_up , then they promised to refund the premium i paid for next_day delivery
positive	very happy with this transaction !
negative	!
neutral	however p_&_p v . expensive as it comes from spain .
negative	ref_:_0000000
positive	will buy again from these_guys .
negative	!
negative	first one arrives - absolute_rubbish silentnight one where it feels empty and all you can feel at the side is springs .
neutral	i have now sent 0 emails of complaint with photos but received no response at all
negative	from now on i will avoid both companies at all cost .
negative	we have processed it as agreed and is beyond our control if it is not yet back in your account ?
negative	ok , so the flight was cheap which is pretty_much all this company has going for it .
neutral	inputting the information on the website for hotel and valet_parking at gatwick , and then correcting inaccurate info was next to impossible for me .
positive	i was amazed at how new the hire vehicle was , it was in showroom condition on pick_up , as it was the first time i had hired a car from hertz i was pleasantly_surprised at the speed of pick_up and drop_off , and the helpful manner of the staff , i will_definately be using hertz again .
negative	so i ve been in touch with my creditcard company and trading_standards .
positive	found the outfit made very well . the whole_experience was easy and the goods were delivered very quickly .
negative	im damned if im going to pay nearly_£_00 quid a year for their super - dooper next_day service !
negative	my house was the only one in my street and even the whole village that was without power once the sub - station issue was resolved .
neutral	everything was present and all the boxes seemed to be undamaged .
neutral	after 0 minutes we spoke to a perfectly pleasant_young_lady_who then said she had to refer to her superior .
positive	usual and predictably faultless service experienced again and again .
neutral	la_calidad de_la bomba no es la esperada tal y_como de describe , y_el envío no fue todo lo rapido que esperaba
positive	great service and costume
negative	i would suggest ambiguity and unreasonable behaviour by supplier ( s ), i do not have a contract with manufacturer but retailer .
negative	so in fact our tickets are up much higher than we wanted ., in what would have been the 0th_row .
negative	the person i was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me , i asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor .
neutral	in fact the colour was closer to yellow !
negative	the whole_experience was an awful way to begin a holiday , i would rather pay the extra and park at the long_stay car_park at the airport .
neutral	in boxes 0 and 0 one of the sachets in each box contained only air .
positive	no booking_fees , and there '_s always nice hostels and hotels .
positive	many_thanks - best regards
negative	absolutely the worst internet experience of my life . avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive	i sent in my design and was quickly replied with a price and a digital mock_up .
positive	brilliant .
negative	i had to phone them to find out when it would be delivered .
neutral	a week_later i received an email_informing_me that they actually did not have the correct sized product and couldn_'_t get any in , i quickly received a refund including my postage cost .
negative	what a shambles of a company
positive	the costs are very competitive and delivered promptly .
positive	happy customer - get what was ordered , no_hassle , no_fuss .
negative	oakland_furniture refused to replace the goods mentioned .
positive	il be back . used you for a few_years_now .
neutral	0_months on and still no refund .
positive	thank_you for a great service .
positive	i bought my grandson 0 bow_ties from my tuxedo as he couldn_'_t make up his mind what colour he wanted .
neutral	.
neutral	in the end i was given the 00th_january as the delivery date , which is later than the worse case given !
positive	everything was i wanted it to be - quick delivery , careful_packing , first_class product , and almost above all else , a very easy site to negogiate - all without_any real effort on my part . i hadn_'_t heard of petfleas before , but i '_ll definitely use them again . tell you what , though - the name put me off at first !!
neutral	i rang interparcel . com at 0 . 00am the following_morning and they said it would be collected the following_day which was the wednesday .
neutral	two foil numbers still ok after two_days .
negative	allposters . co . uk is not a uk site , which had me fooled !
neutral	i cannot understand as to why we are being asked to write a review when all we have done is booked a holiday on - line for later this year - what is the point ?
positive	having received a document to proof , the order was received soon after .
positive	they never let_me down yet and i have bought quite a lot of items from amazon .
positive	this was the first time i ordered from davpack and i have to say that the service and the products have been excellent .
neutral	eventually found email address to contact you .
negative	just recieved information from the hotel i booked with budgetplaces . com that they had been booked up for over a month !!!
negative	thank_you justeat as we got 00_%_off via your site :)
negative	the thing is though , this is a totally_useless domain which only the previous_owner could_possibly want .
neutral	wish i had known that - might have shopped elsewhere as i need the items quite urgently .
negative	you guessed it , 0th phone_call , this time to the english sales_team to find out what was going on ( again ) - i explained the situation , the guy then read out the message that had been recorded on the system by the indian_call_centre in my previous call and neither he or his manager could understand what it was trying to say , so he is raising another transfer . so it continues !
negative	in august we purchased a hotpoint dynd0000 washing_machine .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 update - sent my iphone_0s off to mazuma and they had no problem with it at all .

neutral	thank_you for a lovely ( if not small ) bunch of flowers .
positive	parcel arrived well_packaged and safe a couple of days_later .
negative	until now i still don_'_t have a broadband / internet_connection .
negative	the fitter then returned on the 0th_june and the wardrobe_doors were cut incorrectly , and filler panels the incorrect size .
positive	was good to meet some one who actually knows what they are doing .
positive	there was a slight_problem with parcelforce failing to find my house ( but looking at trustpilot reviews of parcelforce it doesn_'_t seem unusual for them to get things wrong !).
positive	thanks to all at 0dvd .
neutral	apart_from the above complaint the delivery was very quick and , as already_mentioned , the blinds do look very stylish giving the room a cosy warm feeling .
positive	customer_services answered my emails promptly and confirmed what to order via a phone_call .
negative	items arriving damaged , no tags , heel broken on a pair of boots and a strap on a bag snapped .
negative	i will not be spending another penny in this cash_converters store they have no concept of customer loyalty .
neutral	apparently it came out for delivery , went on a journey and returned without getting to me !
positive	fitted in the afternoon & the mrs was happy :-)
positive	i will be recommending the site to my travel patients from now on .
neutral	so sorry to have to make
positive	etc .
positive	they match prices and ship super_fast .
neutral	my issue , and the reason for only giving three stars was with the lack of knowledge and near rudeness with the numerous sales_reps over the phone .
neutral	moreover , the invoice claimed to have sold duracell which is therefore incorrect .
neutral	the price was excellent value , the car was scratched , dented and battered but drove safely , although i had swapped the first one offered as the brakes were on a hair trigger .
negative	emailed zoverstaocked they said allow unto 00 days after despacth date , nothing arrived so emailed them again so the same email back but this time saying allow 00 days .
neutral	i ordered a sink and tap for a new kitchen .
negative	i recieved a few emails apologising for delay .

negative	skal jeg beskrive dem med ett ord vil det i såfall bli søppelfirma !!!!
neutral	the item was posted quickly .
negative	had the review been based_solely on the experience of talking the people on the insurance help line the number of stars given would have been more .
positive	the case fitted the phone perfectly and easily and was just what i wanted .
positive	they hold a great range of products .
neutral	i ordered a £_000 leather_jacket and i picked it up from store as i had to get it delivered as my size was not in store .
positive	without a doubt , one of the best customer service based companies out there . great range of e_- cig '_s and extras , best prices , best forum_members and a great team led by abe and matt . hightly recommend doing_business with this company if your giving up smoking . im using them weekly
positive	the service we received could not have been better .
positive	i spoke to dave_richards on a number of occasions and i have to say his advice was superb , at no time did i get the impression from him that i was being pushed into making a decision and the advice i was given was so important on deciding what was the best option for my particular situation thanks to dave for all his help and being so informative .
neutral	the process of pre_- booking and entry to the edinburgh_airport car_park went without a hitch - a welcome thing at 0 . 00 am , having driven from glasgow for the brussels flight .
negative	thank_you myherpes .
negative	the stress of waiting in and trying to get my parcel delivered was making me ill .
positive	great website with fast and efficient service from date of order to delivery .
neutral	once i had carried everything inside i opened the boxes and found the wc_pan had a mark on the front under the glaze , and the shower_panel bracket was bent in one corner , so had to call better_bathrooms .
neutral	easy to order and arrived quickly .
negative	do not purchase from this company .
positive	communication was excellent through email and text_message and made me feel at ease knowing exactly where my package was !
neutral	so overall , yes my laptop is fixed but a lot of stress , especially over prices which i was not informed over , and the fact they said it was fine and it was broken again the next_morning , a positive was that the second time i brought it in they got it fixed on the day .
negative	they have a call back option on the website however i challenge you to find an available slot !
positive	very nice .
negative	i had to go out and left my daughter to sign for the delivery .
neutral	amsterdam was so so , didn_'_t live up to what we thought but we made the most of it anyway , icebar was a let_down but it was a lovely sunny day had plenty time to do things , we said we will go all out as won_'_t do it again , have been saying it since but now do want to do it again as it '_s a nice 0 day getaway !
negative	if the service works there '_s no need for a community of other customers to paper over the cracks and offer the same boiler plate answers that just increases frustration .
neutral	friendly quick service .
negative	that way you '_ll earn their respect and they '_ll be happy that you ' re trying to help them , and there won_'_t be a problem .
negative	i am a flying blue member which_meant i could access my flight information .
positive	if you need some fancy_dress for any event then we would thoroughly_recommend fanciedress .
positive	however did not last as long as i had hoped but still pleased with product

positive	i can really recommend jgd_crafts without_reservation
neutral	clear website , good choice of bouquets , effortless transaction , swift delivery .
positive	very easy service and quick payment so i don_'_t waste anytime .
negative	there was also no response to my email .
positive	very good quality product , fast delivery .
positive	no_problems with dyson_vacuum and £_000 cheaper_than anywhere_else !
positive	will use again .
negative	received emails_confirming tuesday '_s delivery and updates via_text throughout the day , only to have the driver call me at 00 . 00 , an_hour and a quarter before the last delivery slot , to say he was going to finish now so wouldn_'_t be delivering it today after all .
neutral	we have had a problem with the home emergency policy - following a loss of power in the kitchen the appointed agents appear to have used their subsequent access to us as customers in order to exploit the emergency situation - wanting to inflate the cost of the required part by over 000_%.
neutral	also , having only one delivery man and not being_able to take it upstairs ( it took myself , the ' delivery man ' and a neighbour to carry it along the drive ).
positive	delivery was prompt and i will certainly use them again .
neutral	we then ordered our order of service .
neutral	!
positive	very quick .
negative	was told it was company policy and nothing could be done .
negative	they come and fix symptoms but refuse to replace the cable .
neutral	at this point , one was dispatched and it arrived two_days_later .
negative	wo for me and wow for them .
neutral	i look to the likes of chemist_direct to stock the products that high_street chemists no_longer stock - so it '_s a pity that chemist_direct can '_t seem to get hold of proper selsun shampoo .
positive	you are kept_informed_throughout so you know what stage the production of your blind is at .
negative	their service was dreadful on the phone .
positive	very pleased with whole_experience
neutral	chased on monday to be told ' it '_s on the engineer '_s bench , i '_ll see what '_s happening and ring you back '.
neutral	we did discuss returning the faulty shower , but of course i had paid £ for fitting , so couldn_'_t really do that .
neutral	incorrect splling on my flexible trust form , told this would not make any difference .
neutral	continually suggested that they would be delivered on the 0nd dec .
negative	then next_day , it '_s miraculously out again .
positive	what '_s not to like ?!?!
neutral	big roomy villa with everything you would need for a great holiday .
negative	these flowers were in no way worth the 00 quid paid
neutral	my other issue is that the book was a gift , but it arrived emblazoned with the fact that it was a photo_album which kind of gave the game away .
neutral	the first time we pulled the blind up on the first order it broke and we had to ask for spare_parts to mend it .
negative	i am very disappointed at the service and only hope the flowers are better_than the service received .
neutral	i order a few cd '_s at the beginning of december as christmas_presents , they hadn_'_t arrived after a couple of weeks so i emailed there customer_support .
neutral	if i had the option if going else where i would gave taken it .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery which indeed it did but the amp was placed into to box without_any surrounding protection with the remote_control and mains_lead loose within the box .
negative	!
neutral	they get great reviews most of the time , which is why i chose them , but this seems to have been a blip .

neutral	car had no spare tyre when i had a flat tyre near hawkshead in the lake_district , uk .
negative	made a complaint , got a response asking for further information , then heard no more .
neutral	so don_'_t rely_on the product reaching you as specified .
neutral	dear serenata the flowers that you delivered to my house for my partner were very attractive and festive , but i have to say having been in the flower trade for a number of years i thort they were very small for what i paid !
positive	the website is easy to follow , quick delivery and value for money .
positive	i even changed the order to ensure that my new kit ( mixing desks , mics , amps , the whole nine yards ) would be able to cope with future_projects and allow me to cover all bases .
neutral	a lot of messing for little money , ok telling you of each process that is going on but all that for so little
positive	a really straight_forward and easy to use website .
neutral	i think it is a pity that such a good , fast site is spoilt after checkout .
neutral	the display looks_stunning on the site but in reality the flowers looked thrown together and were not arranged in any sort of pleasing fashion ; the centrepiece rose was very small and not even in the centre of the display ; it was hanging off to one side .
positive	the produce was first_class and the service has_been superb .
positive	example 0 . i nowdont get my cards anywhere_else !!!!
neutral	order placed on 0rd may_0000 and am still_waiting for this .
neutral	i will edit this review accordingly .
negative	original text :
neutral	often out of stock of many products , and you never find out until they ' re at your door .
negative	i am out of pocket £_00 and don_'_t know what else to try .
negative	what a joke .
neutral	unfortunately they sent me the wrong_size for both_pairs i ordered .
negative	having ordered flowers , chocolates and a card on thursday for a friday valentines delivery , i was given a number of options for delivery .
positive	knowable , informative and interested in us as a couple to ensure she understood what we were looking for .
neutral	i wish there were some middle ground between having to deal with goofy things like this and being robbed blind at uk high_street " opticians ".
negative	never answer the phone - didn_'_t have the stock .
negative	i left house to see mother and upon my return a person came to my door and said she was visiting her friend some doors up and was given this box for me .
negative	when we tried to install it we found the depth was considerable more than stated on the website ( the drum_sticks out quite a way )
positive	furthermore , he ' d asked to combine the shipping to refund the delivery charges on one of the orders .
positive	borghetti caffe espresso arrived next_day great service , i have noticed a label change what i wanted used to be called caffe sport , i hope this is the same stuff looking_forward to trying it .
neutral	the transaction was smooth without issue , but i was disappointed that a very expensive ' genuine ' panasonic battery would come just wrapped in a clear plastic_bag .
negative	customer service useless .
negative	phoned customer service to be told that we they would not pick it up and that we must travel 00 miles to return it !!
negative	how can a company with such a poor reputation from across the country detailed so much on the internet possibly receive business ?
neutral	the site recommends posting the phone by special delivery , which in itself costs over_£ 0 .
positive	these knives are seriously sharp .
negative	was supposed to be delivered friday but didnt arrive until monday and tuesday .
negative	i was very glad i had not sent these as a gift as i would have been embarrassed .
positive	what can i say if you have a pet and your looking for a fantastic , service , tips , products then look no further this place is the best !
positive	if your looking for brand_names for a competitive price . this is the web_page to choose .
neutral	i ordered online and expected to get an_email_telling_me when i could collect from store .
negative	they shut_down business and charity accounts and keep all the money .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend buying anything from this company .
neutral	on the plus_side , they are often pretty good for stock control both online and in - store and the staff are generally helpful so i guess you could consider hmv a fall back option if any of the better places to go are unable to fulfil your query .
neutral	i completely understand that as an online_retailer it would be impossible to send out glasses that fitted every customer perfectly but seriously , why_bother sending them out unsuitable for use by 00_% of the population .
positive	i bought the draper 00 piece mechanics bit set ( stock no . 00000 ) for £_00 . 00 , at my local fastparts car shop they wanted £_00 . 00 only difference was it was in a metal case and the one i bought is plastic all the same tools big deal thank_you uk_tool_centre i '_ll be back .
positive	this company had the best price and shortest lead time on the product i needed .
neutral	at no point did regus head_office or centre management acknowledge the referral .
negative	the lorry they sent was so big it couldn_'_t get within three miles of me !
positive	this is one of the best companies i '_ve ever had the pleasure of dealing_with .
positive	where do i start ?
negative	we paid bill but not £_00 immediatly .
negative	more than three_days of trying !
negative	they operate 0 hour slots ( allegedly ).
positive	just one minor_point was that the order was going to take 0 - 0 days but received it in 0 as i was going to slightly modify my order before despatch .
negative	i will be taking this to trading_standards
neutral	good service finally after missing some questions on my top up i received it the following_day
positive	sometimes that means service goes down .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t order again if it is going to take such a long time to deliver .
positive	getting insurance for your phone is really easy with protect your bubble just a few_clicks and its done fab
positive	thanks !
neutral	it was resent and has now been received .
neutral	that '_s the best way he said he could describe it - ok but nothing special .
positive	found site by_accident and ordered because of other excellent reviews .
positive	this machine was to replace a reliable 00 year_old basic model .
neutral	physioroom is a good firm .
negative	it stated that my order had been cancelled .
negative	is that not the site is for !!!
neutral	i then had to drive 00_minutes to the depot and 00_minutes back as i couldn_'_t trust apc to re - deliver .
positive	really clever_idea to supply quotes quickly and simply .
negative	a member of sainsburys staff stole my nectar_card , used up the points i had ( around £_00 worth ) plus points i didn_'_t have so that nectar_card has put minus seven odd_pounds on my card .
positive	easy to fit and covers all as describe .
positive	the delivery was prompt and i received both an email and sms on the day wishing us a great time and a number to call if we had any_issues .
negative	i then phoned them up asking if i could just add the extra cash to upgrade it to the next_day delivery , they said no , so i asked for a refund .
negative	the items in the boxes are my own personal belonging not for resale and i just want them back .
neutral	not aware of conversion as they only handed_over documents after the credit_card was charged .
neutral	unfortunately no one answered it .
neutral	this means less weight and perhaps a saving on packing - time and carriage .
positive	from order to delivery everything was speedy and efficient !
positive	( a night '_s reservation deposit is never more than 0 pounds for me .)
negative	i took the 0 none working ones back and was told i would need to bring back all 0 and have the whole box swapped .
neutral	i did then get two emails acknowledging both orders , two payments made from bank_account and two lots of flowers sent to nursing_home .
neutral	so phones 0 u tell the customer the truth or get your stories straight when you tell the customer a porkie .
negative	i am beginning to feel that this is a bogus company .
negative	recently placed an order for around £_000 and got it cancelled with no reason .
positive	i ordered one afternoon , and it arrived with me at 0 . 00 the next_morning , now i call that outstanding , the delivery guys called me aprox 00_mins before the arrived .
neutral	however , the items i ordered were received by me the next_day .
neutral	i rang the hotel and they apologised and said he would be back in 00_mins .
positive	because i couldn `_t get the threads i needed from local stockists i went straight to the dmc website and they were ordered , processed and delivered all within four days as it was over a weekend .
positive	really quick service and no_problems .
positive	prompt service too , thank_you .
neutral	no matter what they say on website you are also only covered 0rd_party and if you want full comp then you have to pay when you collect an additional circa 00 euro .
neutral	the rating_system is not helpful in my case so i just used it to be able to post these comments so don_'_t use it as objective as we did not have the experience .
neutral	i did not like the way payment was taken immediately and not on despatch .
neutral	however the man i spoke to at the folkestone branch was very nice , pleasant and efficient .
positive	bozo the budgie likes them too !
positive	kept_informed by text / email at every_stage .
neutral	why can '_t they take it off the price i have already paid for my tyres ?
neutral	i recently created 0 calendars on the jessops site and to my delight they arrived very quickly .
negative	), barney phillips ( wholesale channel dir ), vanessa errington - beech ( corporate relationship_manager ) and andrea murray ( operation manager ) know what '_s going on in their organisation .
positive	this is the second time i have used mattressman .
negative	as soon as i got home i got a call from my partner saying that the delivery man had been and gone .
negative	!
negative	my advice is go direct .

positive	it fitted perfect and made me looked smart i know that '_s hard to
positive	their price for the same key was only £ 0 . 00 - including_vat & delivery , so i thought i give them a shot .
positive	i would definately recomend them .
positive	good very good
positive	i would definitley use you again .
neutral	the base of the tree had to be hammered down , just to get it into the stand - from which it won_'_t be coming out of ever again !
negative	sellers sell none .
negative	obviously its too late for me now as i couldnt possibly face the process of going through a reorder of the item .
neutral	0 days to get the tyres in stock !
neutral	good cash_back site but very slow on responding to questions raised .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t really sign up , if you don_'_t shop that often on line .
neutral	once paid the invoice pops_up , which requires you to print it off ,
positive	the package arrived exactly when they said it would do , and i was very excited to receive this particular product of make up called bare_minerals that i had been told is the creme_de_la creme !
positive	the sales_person agreed to get back to me with a recommendation .
positive	good quality goods with lots of choice .
neutral	i never received the promised call to tell me the item was ready for collection but had to call a couple of times myself .
negative	bestilte_en dyr buket til udbringelse på_en arbejdsplads før kl 00 .
positive	many_thanks for your quick and safe despatch of both the model 0 / 00th bus and the paints .
neutral	i am quite it literate but some aspects of the formatting , cropping , downloading and design proved tricky to make my book look as i wanted it to .
positive	returned immediately within 0 days recieved my argos_voucher informed by email all the way
neutral	although i am happy with flowers they were a day late which is a shame when it was for my grandma '_s birthday and she had waited in all day for them to be delivered .
neutral	it is a shame that the customer service was such a let_down as everything else was perfect , customers should always be kept up to date when going through a purchase such as this
neutral	for people who consider eating a couple of nuts and a sultana a day a " snack " they may be ok .
positive	!
negative	stay well away buy tickets from direct site !!!!!!
positive	excellent service at a really good price
neutral	the laser_treatment was fine and you can neither see or feel anything happening .
positive	from prompt dispatch to hassle_free returns these_guys are simply awesome .
negative	unfortunately a further call was required this time answered by someone reluctant to give her name - until pressed .
positive	the colour_swatch samples received and the personal_touch when i received an_email from mr sawyer himself , a great family run business with bespoke tailor_made options !
negative	customers dont have to put up with bad service , and i wont put up with it .
neutral	great service but i have a problem using them because the insurance level is only £_000 . 00 and most of the products we send out are more then that . also they have lost 0 parcels that have cost well over £_000 . 00
positive	i am very happy items and the service i recived will recommend to all my friends and family . the prices are very good will be buying more item soon

neutral	i am on a £_00 a month plan .
positive	they immediately contacted the courier and no more than ten_minutes later , phoned me to reassure_me that i '_d receive my order as scheduled -- there '_d simply been a mistake .
negative	i have purchased a product , via amazon , and the supplier uses_yodel to deliver to their customers .
positive	ordering was easy and there was an impressive level of attention to delivery details and even a helpful relevant video on the website .
neutral	but it is only a fire_blanket , not the crown_jewels and doesn_'_t need security type courier delivery .
neutral	i wouldnt mind so much if the prices were cheap but when you have other shops that are cheaper selling the same sort of thing its quite annoying !
neutral	customer service promised to send me an email update on the friday if they came in with the possibility of a saturday delivery .
negative	these cover every item known to man , which then covers them for never paying any compensation out , even when they are proven to be at fault .
neutral	we had asked for it to be delivered at the start of a week '_s annual_leave so it was not a problem being in for the rescheduled delivery , but in other circumstances people might be very inconvenienced should it happen to them had they taken time off work specially .
neutral	can you imagine the headlines ' child poisoned by poisoned strawberries '.
negative	anyway we paid the extra , which turned_out double what we paid for the car originally and we decided to take it up with argus when we arrived back .
negative	don_'_t do what you don_'_t wish upon yourself . think - how you feel if you are on the waiting end ?
neutral	apart_from that the car was fine for what we wanted .
positive	my car was special to me and it has_gone to a good home at a fair price .
positive	their follow - up systems are also excellent .
positive	it is a bit of a trek to the 0rd_floor , but not as bad as you might think .
neutral	not only are the arms way too short the length in the body is also way to small , it fits at the waist but its tight across the chest .
neutral	package arrived very battered and looked like it had been sliced by a knife .
positive	hills were really good , phoned and emailed to arrange delivery date even_though our circumstances were complicated .
negative	either way it is extremely bad business and in my eyes its a scam .
positive	brilliant !
positive	we found travelwx had the best rates and the service we received was excellent .
neutral	je_ne souhaite pas fusiller l ' enseigne et abonder dans tous_les forums avec_des commentaires négatifs et ne demande qu_' un règlement à_l ' amiable , comme avec toute enseigne sérieuse et respectueuse de ses clients et_de_la législation .

neutral	the pictures that were delivered that were the right size and werent blurred were very good however .
neutral	recently travelled economy to dubrovnik in croatia and whilst the flights were bang on time both_ways , the stewards and the food were not .

positive	my friend_suggested that i try the memory_foam mattress and after finding these competitively_priced at the memory_foam warehouse , i decided to try one .
positive	wow this service is quick and efficient .
neutral	the product arrived on the date , as stated and generally was good quality , for the price .
neutral	this was an inconvenience because he came to my work and i had to arrive hours earlier for my shift because that was the only times slot available to me .
neutral	shame same cant be said about the delivery which was not quite what i expected .
neutral	first puchase went without_any problem and was delivered in a few_days .
negative	!
neutral	oh and they won_'_t give you the tracking_number of your parcel , again for security_reasons ?!
negative	that is a 00_hours window for a company claiming in their site that they will give a 0 hour_window for delivery .
neutral	based on my experience i wouldn_'_t use again .
positive	was very happy with the service , delivery within two_days abroad and excellent quality .
negative	having not recieved my parcel , ( 0st time customer ) - i had to chase pest_control the following week to be told that they could not find the house .
negative	i was furious as one day i had the phone and it was completely switched off with the sim removed so there was no way it was used .
positive	would recommend to everyone .
neutral	got a few emails_telling_me they were then waiting for the frames so was delayed a month .
positive	the service was good too .
negative	oh - and their promise to check it before despatch !
positive	- thank_you :)
positive	fantastic service , would definately use again .
positive	the illustrations were good so it didn_'_t take long to find what i wanted .
neutral	they recently_moved to silverlight , whatever that is - maybe that improves things .
positive	i '_ve always had good service from myswitchshop .
positive	!
negative	they offered me alternative frames (' click here for our huge_range of in stock items ') and a 00_%_discount .
neutral	when i made contact with the company on the tuesday after easter i was informed that they did not work over the bank_holiday .
positive	the website was very clear and easy to use , with good information on all products .
negative	size wasn_'_t quoted on website .
positive	order arrived the very next_day , brilliant , thank_you .
negative	and then inform_me if i still wanted the item (!?!?!
positive	the information provided was clear and accurate .
negative	i do not recommend them .
positive	i sent my phone away and had my money transferred_into my bank_account the sam day they received my phone :)
negative	00 : 00 00 december 000 .
negative	emma was mostly polite - and said they were too_busy to answer the phone .
negative	!
neutral	but what makes it a nightmare experience with you is the using of dpd delivery services !
negative	sort it out man
positive	if you know what your looking for they are generally the cheapest and service cannot be_faulted .
negative	i am fed_up and just want to cancel so i can go somewhere_else where i can receive the services we are paying for .
neutral	i had to phone the office yesterday as wanted to cancel the insurance due to the non response to my emails and non receipt of my insurance_policy that had been paid for .
positive	i am a complete_novice but she put me at ease wit her patience and understanding of what was required .
neutral	music samples are to short .
neutral	if you only wear this occasionally it '_ll be ok .
positive	great range of products .
neutral	every time i squeeze the frame , gently , i hear an unpleasant squeak from the frame .
neutral	delivery arrived next_day .
neutral	apart_from this , dispatchment is fast , some prices are great and the online store is huge .
positive	good service .
positive	the ipsl staff i dealt_with were friendly and helpful .
neutral	i will post again to tell you of the next step .
positive	the site offers a great collection of items and the delivery was very , very quick .
negative	my advice is to read_reviews carefully before_deciding what and who to buy from .
negative	in fact they have failed to collect every one , thats around 0 , these last few_months .
positive	and so easy !
negative	if its out of stock or low stock when you order it tell us don_'_t leave us expecting delivery when it its not going to turn_up when you expected it .
neutral	not to bad , but they was off with their timing about the transfer from one bank to another .
positive	service excellent and it was good to be informed by text of progress and actual delivery .
neutral	item as_described , very pleased .
positive	talked this through with the sales_team and came right in on budget and with a great spec .
negative	i feel let_down and scammed by the company , and feel that it is their fault as the website is not clear .
negative	i waited all day for the call .
negative	once again the fitter had to come_back out to correct the errors with the wardrobe on tuesday 00th_june , and there are still issues .
negative	still_awaiting a report , the courier in question is citylink .
neutral	ok , parcel was delayed .
negative	i have corresponded with prestige_flowers by email and by telephone in a futile attempt to find out what has happened to my order .
neutral	yodel '_s website tracking said they had left a calling_card at the house but they hadn_'_t .
neutral	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
positive	!
negative	basic info !
neutral	i then decided to email the vendor of the apartment direct to find out the issue first hand and i was told the truth , all paris apartments had double booked us through no fault if our own .
negative	he rang back shortly and said that the tyres were not available at the moment , being on back order , and that the person at tyre - shopper had said that an email had been sent to me a few_days prior .
negative	on arrival i went into the reception to find no staff , no problem i thought as they might be busy .
negative	overall therefore disappointed , to say the least .
neutral	the trustpilot site you have chosen is very annoying .
neutral	superb product but the young_men i spoke to were dopey and didnt seem bothered it almost seemed that as i was ordering just one bottle that it was an effort for them , im saying what i have experienced not to moan but to hopefully improve their telephone service !!!!!!!!
positive	well i must_say , that i will not be going back to the conventional type mattress !
negative	slow delivery
positive	seems a quality item , produces a fantastic juice , a little_slow , but more than worth the effort , all said a great buy from a top company
negative	i sent them back at my own_expense , they then refused to refund postage stating that the cushions are 00cm square or 00x00cm and that this measurement refers to a diagonal from corner to corner !!!
positive	thank_you !
neutral	!
positive	i am amazed by the results , the detail , the quality and it was so easy to upload especially with faces to indicate whether it '_s good , ok or rubbish enlarging a print to that size .
negative	an_email didn_'_t arrive until the next_day .
negative	it gave_me the option of thu / fri / sat / mon for collection .
neutral	so i have to go to the supermarket and pay a couple of pounds extra for a fresh battery .
negative	extremely unprofessional , unhelpful and rude .
neutral	i chose to pay for the table in advance to take_advantage of a further discount but this was a mistake as communication from ambienti direct was poor and involved me having to make phone_calls and send several emails to find out if payment had been received and when the table would be delivered .
positive	they are normally cheaper_than some other online companies and they are free
neutral	couldn_'_t believe the pressure on my ears as the a000 descended into manchester_airport .
negative	nigel_o ' hara processed my refund quickly and with no questions , but later reported my review on trustpilot .
neutral	within the hour , for someone to stay in from 0am - 0pm just to recieve a parcel is to much for someone at home
positive	the delivery had been very fast even if i live in france .
negative	i posted a review of a company on trustpilot three_days ago .
positive	great customer service .
neutral	also not much point in having tv '_s in the bedrooms as there were no channels available .
positive	good fan ( airflow icon ) 00 , easy ordering , brilliant delivery service so i will always look at fastlec first in future .
negative	what followed was profoundly pathetic .
neutral	except my order is still to be fulfilled
neutral	manager now is not sarah potter but a new guy called rob apparently
neutral	a convenient and easy way to pay . but if it faults you can in my experience pay for something 0 times over and then you have to wait up to 00 days for a refund
positive	i purchased for her a gf breads recipe_book with some very interesting variations that suggest she might get some decent flavoured bread .
negative	still_waiting_patiently after 0_weeks !
neutral	drive into a car_park got a ticket but was not sure if this was the correct
positive	will definitely keep ordering from them .
positive	they gave the best rate of all the companies i checked and delivered on time
neutral	thought that was a bit mean but anyway all was nice in the villa .
negative	i explained i was only in st_tropez for 0_days and that i had no clothing / toiletries with me .
positive	gur_sewing_machines have such a straight_forward and solid website .
neutral	!
positive	ordered strange " flat_iron steaks " which have proven to be tender and tasty .
neutral	one trip is acceptable but two was not .
neutral	still no sign .
neutral	00 out of 00 to purple_parking , stress_free parking . won_'_t use again .
positive	quick and easy , no_complaints to make .
negative	i just wanted you to know that this was a really good experience , and i really valued his patience and good manner even_though i could see he was busy and stressed .
negative	when i complained i was told it was my own fault as i had fitted it half a mm off center .
negative	blind arrived , looked good , took old ones down , filled holes , put new one up , went up and down but didn `_t open and close . phoned company said blind is fautly would like a replacement . apparently this not classed_as a fault { the blind not working } and because it was made to measure they would not replace it { total b . s } and lies because the law says if an item is not fit for purpose it should be replaced , wether made to measure or not ! as i was not prepared to have a bare window while they collected and repaired it , they sent me a replacement part which luckily i am competent enough to fit . the quality is rubbish , it dosent hang straight , the slats are not straight but i can `_t be bothered dealing_with people who lie and obviously know their product is rubbish . taught me a lesson , spend more on quality and service !
neutral	i was pleased to order my offroad lite sandals before they were available locally but the toe strap nubuck leather had some small dirty marks on both shoes .
negative	i was impressed with the price so decided to give you a try .
positive	i have had excellent service and the products are brilliant !
negative	i have raised a complaint via pay_pal and will report the company to their local trading_standards .
negative	when she realised i am really angry she said she will transfer me to another department but i need to answer several security questions again !
neutral	i wonder were the manager was , and worse still when a potential customer leaves your store will they come_back .
negative	in the end i had to resort to a rather serious letter to the ceo directly , at which stage i suddenly got what i needed .
positive	one needed to go back for an adjustment .
negative	lost out big time .
neutral	please either sort_out your quality or sort_out your guarantee to enable people like me the right to goods that they buy , matching their expectations or the right to return faulty goods as they come_across them .
positive	now if only i could change a tyre .
negative	!
positive	good i didn_'_t as i turned_up so soon !
neutral	when it arrived i was so excited and couldnt wait_till try it on him , to my total disappointment it was huge .
negative	used their tracking_system to find out delivery company used would be xdp derby .
positive	what more could you want .
neutral	great website except that it is confusing when you select your dates .
neutral	0_stars for service but 0_star for website descriptions .

neutral	i nearly gave up .
negative	better that then deal with these fraudsters !

negative	stay away & go with a reputable provider who has uk_based call_centres .
neutral	bjorn recliner_chair and footstool :
neutral	i tried to adjust them myself , but i couldnt seem to make them better .
positive	the last order i put in arrived two_days_later and their product is good quality .
negative	he said it was common_practice to have these problems in his industry and that he could not guarantee a delivery time because the drive might have a heartache or crash so he would never give a gaurantee .
positive	chose standard delivery and arrived when it stated .
neutral	they now stock shelves during the day , or rather during the busiest times possible , rather_than at night , which is very frustrating trying to dodge around them .
positive	excellent .
positive	good quality , quick shipment , great customer service
positive	not only did best0systems have the part in stock , they dispatched it that afternoon and it was delivered first thing next_day .
negative	ripoff merchants and daylight robbers !
positive	the order went through easily and was delivered within two_days .
negative	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via_groupon , 0_weeks before christmas ; waited 0_weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before christmas .
negative	although the flowers arrived , they were in a poor condition looking as if they were well past their best .
negative	i can get a proof of the calls made and received from my phone .
negative	i had booked hotels where alpharooms stated the hotels as having rooms with facilities for the disabled .
negative	i did complaint and said it is not good enough and why has this not been done .
neutral	a new arrangement was then delivered on the requested date and the flowers were beautiful .
negative	we decided to cancel the product and ask for our refund which was over £_000 .
neutral	quality is not amazing for this price . however quick delivery and well_packaged !
positive	i would definately recommend them and will be ordering from petmeds again ( after looking around and comparing_prices of course )
positive	really added a finishing_touch to our baby girls christening preparations .
positive	i also liked the ecologically sound delivery day option - that is delivery when your van was already in the area .
positive	nearly christmas .
negative	on contacting hotel to book taxi from airport , hotel informed be not booked .
positive	i have bought a few things from gear0music and i am very pleased with all off their products , great workman ship , very easy to buy online and delivery is excellent .
positive	i found this website very easy to use .
negative	!
neutral	flowers great but delivery . you needed to be an olympic runner to catch the delivery man .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for more .
neutral	i '_m a small lady and this was not easy to do and quite dangerous . would expect the 0 men that delivered to un pack and check the item was not damaged etc . would put me off ordering again
neutral	i was informed_throughout on the progress of my order which was excellent .
positive	they are a joy to shop with .
neutral	had problems / delays [ over two_weeks ] with my initial order of a winter_wetsuit due to a fault with their order processing .
negative	they even delivered it the following_day !
positive	great service , great prices and great range of products .
positive	the service was second to none ; tails arrived when they said they would and i was kept_informed by text and email at all points , truly great customer service .
neutral	arrived on time , in tact and worked as expected .
negative	oh - i forgot to mention that each time i tried to make a booking the price kept creeping_up , so i ended_up paying around £_00 more for the week .
negative	as part of the order we paid £_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden_frame bed for them to collect .
negative	also , my wife put herself down as second driver on our friends car , the family who did not book through holiday autoes and they were charged 00_euros , so explain_why the same person is charged_twice as much through holiday autoes
negative	after a conversation on the phone i was told they were looking into it with royal_mail .
positive	im so impressed ive introduced all my vaper work_colleagues to the site all who have purchased with good feedback .
negative	total con !
negative	still advertising 0 days .
neutral	i contact my dad several_times on mum '_s birthday to see if they had arrived , by 0pm i was a bit_worried that they weren ’_t going to arrive at all so called eflorist and to my horror i had inadvertently order postal delivery flowers not courier as expected .
positive	alll in all very happy - was a bit_nervous bout getting_ripped_off . didn_'_t happen !
neutral	thank_you for my topper zleeps , and good luck to everyone else who has ordered - you may just need to be patient !
neutral	took a week to get here and was being sent to wrong_address .
neutral	first world problems i know but it '_s an easy thing to get right .
negative	she returned and the flowers had withered away .
negative	e . mail several_times after giving up trying to call them , and they now have automated line about bean_bags .
positive	the product arrived very quickly and was exactly_what i was looking for .
negative	for that reason , i wouldn_'_t attempt to book through them again as my issue was something that could have so easily been rectified .
negative	our flights are with air_france and aero mexico ( both members of the sky team ).
negative	definitely not worth the time and effort .
neutral	i will use again but make_sure i order well in_advance of a special_occasion
neutral	i got the results and service that i would expect to receive as a minimum .
positive	i didn_'_t want to pay too much - they were £_000 cheaper_than elsewhere .
neutral	these things_happen , the issue was dealt_with and so far as i could tell from taking the blinds out of the box but not opening them out ( in case the whole lot had to go back ), the blinds looked exactly_what i wanted .
neutral	the following_morning we received an email_saying our original accommodation had been double booked so we would have to change .
positive	i cannot_believe i have not used you before you have delivered a brilliant service and cannot_fault you whatsoever .
neutral	this needs to be ironed_out though .
neutral	the offers and product range are great .
negative	no one called .
negative	0 .
positive	i would definitely use beanbag_bazaar again .

negative	luckily the sales_team are available , oh but they can '_t help me .
positive	i was very impressed by the very prompt response and resolution to the problem , which was totally out with the companies control as the damage was caused in transit .
negative	a hint of an_apology would have helped the suituation .
positive	we will definitely use this company again .

positive	the order of service i ordered are fantastic quality and look amazing .
positive	from the point of ordering to delivery everything runs_smoothly .
negative	the checking in process before boarding the bus and at the bus
neutral	reason being given , to £_00 approximately . if i hadn_'_t been in such a need to book this quickly , i would probably have looked elsewhere . the
neutral	but i was expecting them to be delivered inside the vase so she didn_'_t have to do it herself but apparently the vase was delivered separately in a box .
positive	does not get any better_than that .
negative	flowers from serenataflowers arrived on time well past there sell by date only place for them was the compost heap very very disappointed recipient .
positive	tyre - shopper were the cheapest and i especially_liked the simplicity of the website - no_hidden extra '_s etc .
positive	i would highly_recommend tickettree and the show abba .
positive	the ordering was easy and the tablets arrived faster_than i expected .
negative	this female customer service person then went on to tell me and i quote " no we have record of receiving the goods back ".
neutral	in general i am happy with range of products and the prices of course - but now i have to wait approx 0 month and twice the delivery has_been postponed . so therefor a 0star
positive	i can '_t sing the praises_enough .
negative	try another online flower shop there are plenty of them !
positive	will use them time and time again - cheap , reliable and top quality
negative	switch to someone_else while you can folks , because there won_'_t be a first_utility left by the time i '_ve finished with them .

positive	user_friendly safe secure and works .
negative	to return it , only got 00_% refund .

negative	i contacted clarins and they informed me that they do not supply this company and the only way i can buy the product i bought is in the clarins website .
neutral	by way of compensation a pair of remote_control units was received .
neutral	ok , good service .
positive	i spent about 00_minutes putting them together .
negative	packing , dismantling own furniture etc
negative	i have been calling the company all day , and ran up a rather big mobile bill in the process as i was just left on hold , with no sign of anybody answering .
neutral	in general the company are fast and cheap but dont always follow delivery instructions .
negative	on contacting customer_services they state " the felt needs replacing ".
negative	they were dead and the sorriest flowers i '_ve ever_seen .
neutral	the others have so_far not appeared .
negative	i have done this today .
positive	thanks you guys !
positive	slightly_confused as received 0 confirmations saying 0 different days for delivery .
neutral	good thing is that the customer service are polite and looks_like trying to help but the servers are too slow with many outages and especially when i need to login to domain control_panel the cloudnext system is not working .
positive	i can wait weeks at my well_known high_street_opticians .
negative	it '_s strongly_worded but no shouting or swearing asking for someone to call me back .
positive	what a result .
neutral	when i queried this they said it was because they were waiting for stock on one of the items .
neutral	i called customer_services to be told it had been delivered to the store a week_ago - day after i ordered !!!
positive	i '_ve had sample sachets of protein_powders , intra workout drinks , pre_workout , a free_shaker and free lifting straps !

positive	delivered on time and as_described
neutral	that said machine looks and works great !!

negative	!
positive	recommended .
neutral	funny how they can instantly respond to such reviews and ' sound ' great and concerned to anyone reading them , but then . still do nothing !
negative	no driver ever attempted a collection .
negative	so i ’_m waiting for a call back as if that ’_s all i have to do is wait around .
positive	very easy transaction fitting_center only 0 miles_away and a convenient time .
negative	i have discovered today via a competitor that balance_optics are no_longer trading but their website is still up and they are taking orders and people '_s money , but have no_intention of for filling any orders therefore do not buy from this company
positive	well_done .
negative	however they didn_'_t .
neutral	it is all to easy for consumers to find the best price available .
negative	shocking .
positive	i '_ve placed a number of orders with cyclestore & every time i '_ve found their prices to be unbeatable & the delivery is really quick , pretty often the next_day .
positive	i would definitely recommend using serenata . com flowers .
neutral	the shipping was free and really fast .
positive	collected the car effortlessly when we arrived in austria and were pleasantly_surprised at being given a new car .
neutral	my other comment is that kwik_fit did not call 00_mins ahead of the job to let_me know when they would be arriving , which is what kwik_fit '_s customer_services had advised me .
positive	with the royal_mail it '_s always a gamble if they will arrive at all .
positive	they have been helpful and friendly and tried their hardest to get my orders to us .
neutral	layout and feature overhauls aren_'_t uncommon , and after they are introduced it doesn_'_t seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent .
positive	very good facilities , all very well and conveniently situated , with minimal walking .
neutral	the service is good , quick to send and in decent packaging .
negative	i then went direct to the firms web_site and managed to complete the tranaction direct , although this was not recognised by wowcher , who kept e_- mailing me to tell me that i should redeem my wowcher before it expired .
neutral	if it ’_s true that i am among the top worldwide 00_% most read reviewer , when are you going to employ me ?
negative	i '_m seriously dissappointed with the service here - i understand that hitches happen , but the lack of contact and resolution has left me never wanting to use this website again
negative	despite stating that my online account , on their website shows my account balance as £ 0 .
positive	its like sleeping on air i wake_up feeling like ive had a really good nights_sleep and totally awake ready for the day ahead .
neutral	ordered a 00kg_bag of dog_food and some dog_biscuits .
negative	anyone reading the reviews on this site will see this as a regular concurrence .
neutral	the simplicity was what separated it and made it stand_out from the other social_network websites !
negative	i work from home and this is completely_unacceptable .
positive	i '_m a returning_customer time and time again . wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else !
neutral	i was offered a refund but now i have to draw on savings to go look for the frames elsewhere whilst waiting for my refund .
neutral	if i '_m spending > £_000 i don_'_t expect to have to pay p_&_p - i would have gone to the store to avoid the charge but the local_stores only had 0 apiece and i needed 0 .
negative	i have advised them to cancel the order and refund me due to the unacceptable level of service .
positive	the owners were there most of our holiday and were very helpful and informative .
neutral	i ordered some valentines flowers for my wife , to be delivered on valentines_day .
positive	obviously , it '_s not nice if your experience about somewhere or something has_been less_than favourable , but as long as you point out that this is what happened to you personally , then it really is up to the reader to make up their own mind and take your comments tongue in cheek .
neutral	the catalogue is confusing , giving very little information as to what problems the pills are for .
neutral	my experience would have been a lot smoother had they just concentrated on the job in hand .
positive	great product & very good service , i had a problem with my first order , phoned & a replacement was there the next_day
negative	i purchased mothers_day flowers from this company and they never arrived .
positive	excellent will be using this again .
positive	i was down to the last tablet for my 00 year_old dog so was over the moon he didn_'_t have to go without .
neutral	overall i like the product - but the front_cover is not exactly as i had hoped it would look - slightly off centre and some of the photos could look clearer than they do .
positive	i ordered some glasses from drinkstuff . com .
neutral	worse , if you urgently need to get hold of them by phone , their phone number is a premium_rate number .
positive	will use gak again and would not_hesitate to recommend to friends and families .
negative	disgusting .
neutral	paypal .
neutral	please notify_me at the earliest time poss trust me we go every year 0 to 00 people thx
positive	quick service , great price and great price
negative	they immediately took the payment using paypal and then . nothing .

negative	this has deeply upset me and spoilt christmas .
positive	i ordered loads of threads for two different projects .
negative	i ’ ve just contacted the cheshire business leaders and cheshire community foundation , who were keen to hear about chess_telecom and the way they do_business .

positive	ordering_process on their website is quick and easy , the payment was secured through palpal and delivery arrived when expected on all 0 occasions .
positive	what a great service and competitive price , we shall be ordering more in the future
negative	on my return i have tried to contact the company to get our fee back ; as yet , the phone remains unanswered !
negative	to make it worse the item is still advertised as being available on the website .
negative	doesn_'_t deserve a star .
positive	the bunch of flowers i bought were reasonably_priced and the recipient has told me they look far more_expensive than what they cost .
positive	looked at a few pharmacy '_s and wildricks was not only the cheapest but gave a great service
negative	bold lavender 00 pk x 0
positive	we chose optimalprint as they had a great choice of card templates for our baby_daughter '_s thankyou cards .

neutral	the replacements arrived and all was fine .
neutral	i will book with aferry . co . uk again as they are a very good hub for ferry bookings , but next time i hope i don_'_t have to go chasing to find the confirmation_email .
neutral	it was good to link various_places and note where to return to next time we are in london , when we have more time to explore .
neutral	so , first the description of where to go at heathrow_t0 wasn_'_t very helpful - " next to prada " but where is prada ?
neutral	the product itself is a christmas gift for my daughter , i was surprised that there are not extensions to the return period in view of this .

neutral	additionally i ordered a vase as wasn_'_t sure if they had one but it wasn_'_t big enough for the bouquet .
neutral	excellent .
negative	i still didn_'_t get it so i called on monday and the staff that spoke to me found out that it wasn_'_t even sent at all , and she was telling_me she wonders why that should be .

negative	ordered a bouquet for nearly_£_00 (£_00 . 00 ) including delivery for delivery on valentines_day : comparable to other_suppliers prices , however i really liked the picture on their website so decided to use them rather_than one of the more established suppliers - a mistake i never intend to make again !
positive	i was away from the family , need an appliance , need the old one disconnected , the new one delivered and fitten and the old one removed .
neutral	nowadays everything works to a 0 day week and would have thought this would be the same .
negative	only one containing the poles delivered the box with the awning is missing , value £_000
positive	the desktop is exactly_what i wanted , it is perfect , i only had one issue i bought a new 00 " monitor with my purchase and they probably unknowingly sent it with a 0 pin_plug , which luckily wasn_'_t an issue for me as i had an_adapter , but others may not be as fortunate .
negative	i re emailed asking for a refund no reply .

neutral	items not delivered on time and to wrong_address .
positive	as a first time customer with cyclestore . co . uk i was very pleased that they were very quick to dispatch my order and kept me up to date with my parcel .
negative	took payment and order on tuesday , called them on the wednesday to explain that i needed the gift to be delivered before the friday of that week as this was a business address and there would be no one to sign for it after .

positive	prompt efficient service
negative	i '_ve ordered lots of things on the internet , and apart_from a few minor quirks , all the transactions have been conducted in a professional_manner and very smoothly , but i guess we all get_stung sometimes , and i basically fell_into a massive bush of nettles with gameseek !
neutral	customer_support is friendly
neutral	i called customer service to amend my order five_minutes after_placing it .
negative	however , although i had written my greeting for the card , it was just a blank card .
negative	i am now paying a local watchmaker £_00 to service a watch that i had much greater expectations of .
neutral	have never had a problem getting media or games for play , but a couple of times orders from their gifts and gadgets have taken longer then the cds / dvds to arrive , and once was not in stock despite taking the order online .
neutral	the only_downside was the actual flowers , i '_m not sure what florist they came from but they were awful .
positive	requested special delivery instructions which were carried_out .

positive	the delivery men were excellent , polite , considerate and concerned for our cream carpet .
neutral	sas are probably the most punctual airline i fly with , but this comes at a cost , the service is very expensive , there seems to be no limit to how much they charge on some routes , the price for an economy return ticket from manchester to stockholm can be as high as £_000 during busy weeks , meaning i often use lufthansa via frankfurt instead even_though this service is a lot more inconvenient and very prone to long delays .
neutral	i initially was not sure_whether she was listening to me at all .
neutral	certainly , although i would have no_hesitation using the whisky_exchange again , it will not be until they change their couriers .
negative	waited in all day .

positive	much to my pleasant_surprise , i got an email with a couple of hours to say it ' d been dispatched and lo & behold it arrived the following_day .
negative	i asked for a refund , the squrming and wittering was embarrassing to hear , i had to wait days for the money to be returned and in the end i had to place a claim through paypal .
neutral	iv had that i placed an order when the website was being changed and it wasn_'_t acknowledged iv had that things have been out of stock but not updated on the website which i just find disappointing that i have to then choose something_else to what i had my hopes up for and also the fact the items i order are for presents and iv had close calls with them not being sent in time yet i order in plenty of time but the problems don_'_t seem to flag up fast enough how does it take 0_days to notice an item is out of stock from the order being placed ?
negative	a ) why they were advertising items they didn_'_t stock
negative	( that '_s unfair , everyone has their own likes and dislikes with music - but seriously , i '_d rather hear coldplay !!!)

positive	did what they said , completely stress_free
positive	thanks .
neutral	never had a problem with the delivery before but after nearly a month the dog was wasting away without his food .
neutral	i bought the cigar for my husband , as his friend has one , and thought it would save him money and cut him down on real cigars as they are expensive , he_likes the cigar look , but would like it to have a cuban cigar flavour , as he_finds it very bland in taste , as he put it , its tasteless as far as a cigar goes but its something to do with my hands , if i don_'_t have any proper cigars and feel like a smoke .
positive	have been buying from natures_best for several_years and will_continue to do so .
neutral	most of the problems weren_'_t missguided '_s fault , but if i '_d of known a signature was required , i wouldn_'_t of gone with next_day delivery , as it could of been left with the neighbour then .
negative	after a few more phone_calls , during which i '_d been promised the missing item , i was told ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ), that the item is not available and would be re - ordered from the supplier .
negative	the phone was in perfect working condition .
neutral	other than that the service is good and i will probably use again .
positive	would highly_recommend and such a huge_saving compared to high_street diy_stores .
neutral	i had to look hard on the internet for info re fitting the boards , i was also unaware that they needed to be stored flat , and they warped , which made fitting more difficult , had to use props to jam against wall .
negative	i work in a completely remote_location with no links to public_transport and all my colleagues had left for the day .
positive	they have done all they say they do & in me have a customer for life .
neutral	price agreed through your company and actual ; price charged at the end of the rental has a £_000 difference !!
positive	my daughter '_s boyfriend ( kieran wood ) let_me try some of his food , i '_m glad he did .
negative	i am very very unhappy .
negative	forget double pay promise . still_waiting for topcashback to cough up that too . that '_s nothing to do with their clients . just them being lazy .

positive	i was very impressed by the speed of delivery - better_than some uk high_street chains !
negative	had to close my business account because they don_'_t employ bankers - just so - called " customer service " staff to whom they pay minimum wages .
neutral	this for some reason is not as easy as it should be and may hinder future orders .
negative	we made a point of checking on of their online " reviews " one of which turned_out to be fake ; there was no " z black " and the company had never_heard of soho00 .
positive	received both back without_delay or fuss .
neutral	i thought the puzzle didn_'_t really have enough scope as my 0 year_old granddaughter did it straight_away and once it had been solved it '_s use was over .
neutral	fast delivery and dispatch , would recommend though packaging was not discreet h i hoped it would be .
positive	someone put me onto pc_specialist .
negative	bank confirms the money has_been claimed , delivery address is the same as billing_address .
positive	i purchased from another well_known supplier a saturn back to wall_toilet and installed it earlier this year .
negative	really not happy with the service i '_ve received .
neutral	not 000_% convinced but will reorder and keep an open mind .
positive	i want my printer to a ) be fast b ) be easy to maintain and c ) cost_effective .
positive	i can '_t thank them enough for taking all the stress out of my claim .
neutral	i inserted a video and the film strip graphic was added to the page , but the mock perforations of the film strip allow the surrounding photos to show through which looks messy .
negative	most of them insist on cash payments ( i have no idea how tax is therefore paid on these jobs either incidentally ), and few are trained in any recognisable way past being physically able to lift things .
neutral	you force the buyer to eat - consume all fast .
negative	i emailed cex but after two_days of no reply , i went to my local cex store .
neutral	i took some photos of the cleome , and sent it to dobies , but unusual for them , i have not had a reply .

positive	the driver gave_me the paperwork at the end of the delivery which explained the process .
negative	this is what we ended_up doing and my father is delighted with the small shoprider monaco scooter bought from the well stocked retailer ‘ the mobility shop ’ in west moors , ferndown , dorset .
positive	the staff were always knowledgable on products and helpfull in finding the right products for me .
neutral	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
negative	we repeatedly requested a returns number - our requests were ignored .
negative	you live and learn !
negative	then when it '_s posted they use royal_mail snail service so don_'_t expect to get your goods anytime_soon .
neutral	good pre and during care but lacking in follow_up .
neutral	ie some sort of message service for recipient and clear separate billing for customer .
negative	i wish i had read all the negative_reviews before i placed my order .
positive	great service with no_problems_whatsoever , prompt delivery all good .
negative	we then had to arrange to be in another day ( they don_'_t deliver on weekends ) so that the broken sink could be collected and a replacement provided .
negative	i had to spend precious time carefully separating them .
neutral	speaking with customer_support was a little difficult , i had a mix - up with regards to what course i was enrolled in and i didn_'_t get the feeling the customer_support was genuinely listening to my concern .
positive	we always seem to have a rapid_response no matter_how strange the part required .
positive	i regularly shop with beautybay . com for my facial cleanser , a product i cannot buy in the shops .
positive	dhl then did an outstanding job .
neutral	the advice was as minimal as possible and when i asked a question it was yes / no as if i should know what to do .
negative	apart_from their inability to provide the goods that are ordered from them , they obviously also can '_t count as it '_s now 00 september and yes , you '_ve guessed it , i '_ve still not got my money back .
negative	i asked them why they never_let_me know about the stock issue and delays , but they just ignored the question and said it ' d be sent as soon as possible .
neutral	needless to say i shall not be making any further on - line purchases .
neutral	however , this time , because of a ' change to their computer system ' the guy at the nottingham office typed in all our details and said ' computer says no '!

positive	not sure of what to expect as found blackcircle on a web search .
negative	i have been waiting for groceries meant to arrive 0_days ago .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed .
positive	i fully recommend mazuma .
negative	do not think about ordering anything off this totally_useless oufit .
neutral	you get e_mails saying your goods have arrived , then they ` re being checked ( and if any are not acceptable - they don_`_t return them or let you know , you have to check yourself !).
negative	this is the worst experience i ever had .
negative	who wanted to talk more about the membership i enquired_about .
neutral	not even up to the standards
neutral	as i paid good money for these i expected better .
negative	they were extremely rude to me when i rang them and hung_up on me .
positive	the products i purchased were really good and i will use these again .
positive	communication was also first_class advising delivery date and even time .
positive	smooth website , swift service and cheap
negative	at 00 . 00 this morning a driver rang me waking me up to tell me we will be there in 00 - 00_mins i explained that someone would be there around 00 . 00 or that i could advise them of a secure area .
neutral	the pricing on the website was great , however there isn_'_t enough information_regarding the need to send in a prescription and i didn_'_t get the email requesting it til the following_day .

negative	0 ) might i add they deliver super slow .
neutral	when l placed the order l was not told of the change , they did not contact me , although they said they phoned my mobile but l did not receive an e_- mail or message on my land line so when the insulin didn_'_t arrive l had to go to my vets and buy another bottle .

neutral	i have used iflorist on several_occasions now and on the whole the service is good .
negative	i asked to escalate the issue and was again promised a callback .
neutral	they ' re selling a product .
negative	and before you try , in your usual way , of distancing yourself from all your responsibilities , i would also like to mention that friends on the same flight as us who booked their car through another company , not holiday_autos , were not charged this 00_euros .
negative	the courier said " oh i '_m new to this round , and i don_'_t know the area , so i didn_'_t come ".

neutral	i sent an_email to customer_services and they responded very quickly , sending another replacement dish straight_away .
neutral	we order phospherone for our dog and find it very usefull when she is left at home on her own .
positive	not the cheapest on the market but you generally pay for what you get and i '_m pleased with the price / quality ratio of these .
neutral	quite disappointing actually
negative	this is in breach of the distance_selling_regulations .
negative	they should not be taking customers money , making promises that the delivery date would not be changed again only to let you down once more .
neutral	ha !
negative	now , i '_m told my original documents are lost by the bank ( again as though this is somehow my fault ).
positive	if you want good quality chocolate at a reasonable price you can '_t go_wrong with chocolate_trading

positive	we have used the service twice_now and have been very impressed indeed and will be using again in the future .
neutral	very disappointing experience
neutral	otherwise , mechanics were generally happy to help and advise and i '_m happy ( as happy as can be when spending hard_earned_cash on car tyres ) with the end_result .

neutral	i buy flowers for my wife regularly , and this product doesn_'_t compare to other services i have used .
negative	when asked why they cannot arrange_collection they replied they only have facilities to accept royal_mail .

negative	i contacted them and they refunded it but said they couldn_'_t give an explanation - just not a good enough response for such a breech of trust !
positive	delivered exactly as stated .
negative	very disappointed - not at all what i had ordered .
neutral	because we had to wait for other people making purchases that decreased the time we had for dinner .
negative	it would appear they have absolutely no_intention of publishing reviews below 0 or 0_star , despite their claims of guaranteed ' real customer feedback ' - it seems all reviews go before ekomi '_s review team who release the review providing there are no 0 , 0 or 0_star_ratings , if there are it goes to ' mediation '.
positive	fast shipping , excellent communication
positive	fast acknowledgement they had received my phone and it was checked and funds received same day .
positive	outstanding quickness .
negative	i then changed the order and was due a refund - this was never sent .
negative	they were not the colour i expected
neutral	iv called lesters but all they have fine is give me my delivery code ( already had it ) and told me to check on hermes site .
neutral	website should be more clear in usd .
negative	was continuously told that the email had been sent and that it was a problem with their computers . rather conveniently though the email with the link for payment seemed to arrive in my inbox just fine .!
neutral	communication :
neutral	i got this went to book my seats and guess_what you can '_t do it .
positive	will definitely go back to them in the future , very high_quality goods
neutral	again it was easily_rectified but it did give the impression that the process was poorly implemented .
positive	i submitted my request on a thursday and got a quote .
negative	i ordered waited 0 hour 00_mins .
positive	product was exactly as_described and seems good value .
positive	hi ordered my memory from mr_memory and the service was second to none was really surprised by the superb and fast delivery from the original order to the courier arriving , recommend them for memory anytime :-))
positive	very efficient business .
negative	we were going to have a conservatory made by supaglazing , thankfully we did not sign the dotted_line .
neutral	so by the time i phoned a query i didn_'_t receive the item for over a week and a half . however i did get a refund and an_apology from cpc .
neutral	and the other thing about the android_app .
negative	stating that the flowers have now been delivered and for me to have a nice day !
positive	excellent and fast service
neutral	if they send me a reminder next december , in anticipation of my wife '_s birthday , i shall use them again .
neutral	there are many_times when i try to check - in when in a store only for the dialogue box to come up " you must be in the store to check - in " but i am !
positive	i '_ve just bought a massage_chair for my wife as a birthday_present .
positive	i ordered two small trophies as part of leaving gifts .
negative	0 . very dissapointing indeed .
positive	a short_walk to your left and you were on a vaporetto going up and down the grand canal .
neutral	you have to question why they only have a ' 0000 ' number .
positive	huge_range of quality products .
negative	the agent iman on the phone said he would call me back in 00_minutes .
positive	great service & great value .
negative	i would not recommend eflorist .
positive	wish them continued_success
neutral	however , since being sold by baa you have hiked up your prices and now levy a ' handling_fee ' for certain methods of payment .
positive	no luck .
negative	i would never use virgin again .
negative	it is easy to be cheapest , when you hide charges .
neutral	i would have given more stars but the product package was a bit bent .
positive	excellent on prices as well .
negative	after asking fro prices them confirming my order i was told it would take up 00 working_days as some of the items were not in stock .
neutral	we '_ve had a lot of deliveries , large and small and never had this problem before .
negative	they hurt , they are big ( so they dont stay over your eye ) so i think i have payed for nothing .
negative	at 0 . 00 im phoned and told the driver is over 0 hours away , driving from dover ( to hampshire ) and that actually they are going to cancel my fitting !
negative	despite me contacting them three_times , each time waiting between one and two_weeks for a response .
negative	if a medical company can '_t stock something as basic as a syringe , there '_s no hope .
neutral	ramada .
neutral	good price , good service . for front end poor !
negative	absolutely apalled .
neutral	it left me under the constant threat to run out of petrol before i even reached the airport and it reflects_badly on the provider who is clearly trying to make money with the fear of their clients - not very nice .
negative	british_gas is the main supplier of 00_% of these sites .
negative	my credit_card was debited on placing the order , not on despatch as some better companies do .
neutral	( i van hear you all saying well all fool you but i would like to decide what gas i guzzle ) insurances against the silly things in life such as scratches tyres etc .
neutral	the company resent the correct item on the same day which turned_up three_days_later .
positive	exellent service and after sales advice .
negative	a waste of an_hour and goodness know how much for the 0000 number .
positive	now for some accessory purchases .
negative	it is not right that a company like this can get away with what they do when all they have to do at the end of it if someone takes the trouble to go to cab or trading_standards is there money back - your just back where you started then , with no bed !
positive	i shall now investigate my vet '_s attitude to providing prescriptions , as i can see from your weebsite that some prescription items - eg advocate spot - on - are even more heavily_discounted .
positive	very professional !
positive	i found the prescription service easy to use and the prices of both the food and medication are very reasonable .
negative	thought their prices were too good to be true but thought i ' d give them a go , what an_idiot i was !!!
positive	part arrived with in 00_hours of purchase great service
negative	in return i got a email back from mr simon_betts spouting more rubbish but the threats had now got serious .
positive	very efficient .
positive	well recommended .
positive	thank_you for such excellent customer service .
positive	will always recommend .
negative	cut the cost or remove the deliver cost and one might consider returning .
negative	when i reported this to serenata_flowers i received an_email_advising that they had spoken to the driver and confirmed they were left at the correct_address .
negative	let_me make it clear that i require a refund for the item .
positive	an absolutely_brilliant shop well_worth being your permanent costume shop !
neutral	a really nice lady on the end of the phone was most helpful .
neutral	so if i hadn_'_t been concerned and contacted zen_bedrooms the day before , that is the ridiculous_amount of notice i '_d have been given about my delivery .
negative	garage contacted me to bring my appointment forward , i arrived early and all appeared well , until i got home & realised that the tyre_fitter had fitted the new tyre the wrong way around on the rim & had also damaged the edge of my alloy_wheel .
neutral	i dont mind the look but the categories are all over the place .
neutral	i '_ve been sick from the last 0 pizza rounds from my local domino '_s , so i want be ordering from them for a looooong time :(
negative	i was happy with the product and the delivery .
negative	if my mother organises for the flowers to be redelivered through the post_office and they are dead and my mother can call and get a replacement .
positive	the sweetcure bacon is the best bacon i have ever had .
neutral	not left_securely ( even_tho they reported back that they were .)
positive	the web_site is easy to use and the address book is very handy .
negative	why would i pay again for something that they should have sent correctly in the first place .
negative	0 lettuces with yesterdays date on them , ( the date we orriginally ordered )
positive	goods were delivered promptly
positive	very pleased with my goods .
positive	no_problems at all .
neutral	the online tracking_facility showed the parcel as ' out for delivery ' during the day , up until 0000 ( when it had not arrived ) and the tracking then showed ' at the depot '.
negative	so disappointed and angry at the service i received . also i phoned every day since the thursday after outfits were ordered and not a lot if help was given .
neutral	service was ok quick boarding and ship was fine , however the toilets were disgusting , the children '_s play_area was broke ( we had to tuck a bit up out of the way so the children didn_'_t strangle themselves ), false_advertising in the duty_free shop i thought a bottle of perfume was good value for money after_seeing the tester bottle being the larger one only to find it was for the smaller one - with no option to buy the next size up .
neutral	buy from wowcher if something interests you , but use some caution as it '_s not like buying from [_external ref .]
positive	i received the packages promptly .
negative	seriously ?
negative	result ( my wife buys a pile of stuff on ebay on the saturday and it all arrives well before my item does ).
neutral	was dismayed that i now have to pay (& not a few_pence !)
neutral	a couple of the items i had to return and this is not easy to do either .
neutral	so they said they would post immediately for delivery the next_day .
negative	item was out of stock once i had paid for it .
negative	i ordered a bunch of flowers for my mother on mothering_sunday .
positive	and when i phoned them they were very helpful .
positive	nature shops pricing is excellent .
negative	just google them !
positive	i was after a replacement stylus for my audio_technica at00e cartridge .
neutral	i was told i could return the pack and they would send me the groupon deal but i would have to pay for postage to return which a was minimum £_00 .
positive	easy to use and very straightforward
neutral	most annoying thing was waiting in all day for a non delivery !
negative	i waited on hold for 00_minutes only for the phone to cut_off .
positive	the things i look for in a supplier is the product i need , at the right price and quick delivery .
positive	to my amazement it arrived on the thursday !!
negative	nothing came , they said there had been some_confusion , they didnt think i wanted it any more ( they didnt think to refund me tho ).
neutral	besides that the strimmer looks good , but i haven_'_t had a chance to try it yet until the facemask arrives .
neutral	the cheque finally arrived a week_later , the date on the envelope from fonebank . com '_s franking machine indicated it was not posted on the same day , but rather some 0 day after they told me !
negative	does anyone have any help they can give me , what to do next .
neutral	i was a little disappointed when i saw the flowers especially as they were to celebrate the birth of a new granddaughter .
neutral	so who made and kept the copy ?
neutral	makes me think_twice about where to place my next purchase .
positive	never had any_problems with a booking , and in fact the last two theatre trips through lastminute have resulted_in free upgrades on arrival .
positive	faultless service .
negative	the failure to fit my brakes properly also leads me to have concerns about the quality of the rest of the work done on the car .
positive	!
neutral	dissapointed .
negative	shelves should be stocked appropriately and should not be mixed up with different offers .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t have taken much to either secure them in the boxes to stop them moving round or to add in some bubble_wrap to protect them in transit .
neutral	ordered a light online on sunday_evening and paid up front so i could chose a collection day of the following_tuesday .
negative	annoying !
negative	the old bed that had been taken apart was not in state to repair , so we just had an old mattress on the floor to sleep on .
positive	quick delivery and very pleased with quality .
negative	i ordered a pair of shoes from ebay .
neutral	i want to take your offer of a voucher to redo the order but need to know how to get it and how to send book back . also address in which to send it .
neutral	delivery let them down , ended_up a week late
negative	mistakes can happen , but i felt they should have done more to put it right .
positive	phone_calls and texts to let_me know when it was arriving .
negative	didn_'_t receive my item .
positive	chemist_direct not only offered the cheapest available prices for the pet dietary_food i needed to buy but the service was swift ; goods arrived securely ( not_overly ) packaged no later than mid - morning of the next_day ( with the £ 0 . 00 next_day service ), eventhough i '_d ordered the goods after the advised cut - off time ( 0pm ) the day before .
negative	she said she heard someone at the door , but before she got there the person had gone .
neutral	.
neutral	wasted half an_hour on what should have been a simple query answered .
negative	not that important but the promotion was james_bond and the new dvd skyfall and that wasn_'_t even in the package .
negative	the wardrobe that was delivered could not be dismantled and it spent a month in our_hallway whilst laura_ashley argued over their returns_policy .
negative	beware .
neutral	the company service is generally good - but i have not yet had a problem with an order besides the courier turning_up at 00 past 0 when everyone had gone home ( and a 0 o_clock cut_off was specified ) but the driver was more than happy to return the following_day .
negative	bank is not involved at all .
neutral	it said packaged with care . this might be true but they need to work on getting the delivery sorted_out because by the time they arrived at the destination the presentation was not great .
positive	i hope to see you next year !
neutral	surely any delivery company worth its salt would at_least attempt to reach the delivery address .
positive	bagsdirect delivered promptly .
positive	could not be easier .
negative	i had to buy bt wifi access for 0 quid a day for the last 0_weeks , because they can '_t even tell me when the fix will be available !
negative	i reported the damage to the car_park office , but they were less_than helpful , and although i was told someone would be in touch no one has contacted me to date .
neutral	basically they messed_up my order .
positive	the dealer was great and reassured me of all their safeguards for my money .
positive	great service and come in allocated time_slot .
negative	i did show your distributor this last night .
negative	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
positive	having used this company previously they were first choice when i needed party wear again for an 00th_birthday_party .
positive	when my stuff arrived and i was unsure what to do i called again and got the same girl who pointed me in the direction of the video they had posted on how to put_together the vivarium .
negative	he then went on to say that this was the maximum_amount i would pay if the tank was empty .
neutral	found it impossible to find out what time they would be delivered - they didnt arrive until around 0 . 00 in the afternoon .
neutral	bought the orange and blue max shelves .
positive	fast delivery of my dogs protexin and lowest_price on whole of the web .
positive	it was so refreshing to deal with a company who did everything to make_sure i got the correct product at the cheapest price .
neutral	however the recepient got them and all was well .
neutral	i have been using google from the beginning .
positive	they came the next_day in the post and were very well priced .
negative	not likely to happen as i won_'_t be using them again
neutral	my much needed radio_mic replacement was not in stock as ordered and subsequently proved to be no_longer available .
negative	still_waiting for goods to arrive .
neutral	the protein was good as the flavour was great but not enough protein_content was in the protein and the stability ball was disappointing as the ball would not inflate and the ball pump broke which show build quality was not good and a refund or a replacement was not given .
negative	my conclusion is that trust_pilot is not a reliable forum for consumer_protection in the least .
neutral	i work 0 days a week from 0am_till_0pm so i missed the delivery , when i called the company to re arrange delivery to either my worksite or a neighbors house they said that they could do nothing without permission from the sender , and unless i sorted it out by that day it would be returned to sender .
neutral	update 0 - red bean_bag arrived mid feb after valerie arranged to send another in the post - agreed one lost in postal_system .
positive	i found a fantastic deals on grohe taps , saving a lot of money , and i was very pleasantly_surprised by the free next_day delivery .
neutral	no saving over local_dealer and you don_'_t have to wait for the delivery .
positive	i ordered 0 online from medicines0pets for £_00 . 00 and they arrived 0_days_later .
negative	when amazingly someone answered !
neutral	prices erratic against_competitors
negative	wonder what the customer service will be like .
neutral	everything was great from consultation to operation , but my only_concern was the lack of after care comunication , i had to call for checkups , my husband had to take time of work to travel from fife to dundee for my 00 minute appointments when there is an optical_express within 0 miles from my home and a bus journey i could have taken on my own .
neutral	when we contacted the store they said they did notice it but sent it because they knew it was a present .
negative	no delivery arrived and today we have an_email_saying we weren_'_t at home .
negative	i have previously been very happy with the downloads .
negative	i want 0 euros refunding to me to cover the fuel that is always left in a tank
positive	a fast efficient service made easy highly_recommended
positive	the very next working day they called me and arranged for the item to be returned ( a very reasonable sum of £_00 carriage ).
positive	the item was purchased in the afternoon and it was delivered the following_morning as promised at the websit .
positive	i wish more companies treated their customers like this !
negative	only gave them a star because i couldn_'_t post unless i did believe me they don_'_t rate at all .
neutral	i find purchasing with littlewoods as a bit hit and miss .
positive	i have used sevenseas three_times now , uk to au , au internal ( mel to bris ) and au to uk .
negative	felt the man i spoke to just wanted to say his bit and get off the phone .
negative	i will not order from here again and that includes their other site zavvi .
neutral	0 . it will be more convenient , if the website can list the fully paid and unrefundble hostels .
positive	took just over a week to deliver from purchase , but it was totally worth it - both_pairs are of high_quality , and they look awesome on !
neutral	the last time we needed to fly was when our car broke_down in france .
positive	easy site to navigate around and simple forms and guidance to complete the transaction .
negative	i will be contacting britelite to express our disappointment and needless to say will not be using them for our work .
negative	would happen maybe one day in four .
neutral	goods got despatched ok but their courier service is rubbish !
negative	!
negative	they don_'_t answer emails and it '_s takes at_least 00_minutes to get through to someone on the phone .
positive	always excellent service and speedy delivery .
neutral	however , all the staff i spoke to seemed most efficient and courteous , and even the late delivery driver couldn_'_t have been more helpful . just unfortunate that by the second delivery date ( after waiting for the item to be in stock ) time was crucial and so particularly marred my opinion - shame this is the first of 00 radiators needed !
neutral	no help from the company - just a statement that , since i had put it up myself it was beyond their control .
negative	reply to reply :
neutral	once the member of staff finished his job he told me he has not fitted my spare_wheel back under my car because it was too " stiff ".
neutral	i would not recommend market money based on my experience .
neutral	great seating for bruce springsten concert .
neutral	great service to start with , ok service resolving the problem .
neutral	0 times i have tried to use and 0 times it has failed and the worst thing was that i was in a position where it wasn_'_t even clear if my trade had executed so i had to do the trade again .
negative	i offer to pay by credit_card for order and they can put through order as they want and i am told they cannot do that because of data_protection !.
negative	at the moment i do not trust tesco !
positive	very happy with the service and the price .
neutral	!.
neutral	comfortable .
positive	wonderful customer service .
positive	item is exactly as_described and worth_every_penny !
negative	!
positive	the speed and courtesy shown at shoetique is second to none and it is tremendous in this day and age to obtain personal treatment .
positive	i couldnt have asked for any more .
neutral	i '_ve_used for restaurants and hotels and my advise is the same for both .
positive	vast_majority of orders are shipped the same day as ordered and with you in 0 or 0 days normally .
positive	when i went through towards payment , i made a stupid mistake , i made the payment with paypal , but forgot to change the delivery adress to my girlfriends adress .
neutral	i would like a bit more detail on size and fit too .
neutral	it took longer to repair than to assemble .
negative	figleaves . com refuse to admit this item is not fit for purpose and will not acknowledge / recognise my complaint
neutral	i placed my order online , having given tooled_up personal setails .
positive	i found 0dvd on the web as i was looking for someone to transfer a video 0 film to dvd . the film was found in an old camera in the back of a cupboard and i managed to coax enough power in the cam corder to see that the film had some family shots .
positive	others take_note .
neutral	not a bad_experience all in all , but they really do need to work or their correspondence .
positive	on suffering from plantar_fasciitis for the past 0_months i took delivery of the night splint and awoke the following_morning to my first pain_free morning steps .
positive	ref .
neutral	otherwise , the flowers are very nice and came with a nice card .
positive	i would highly_recommend serenata_flowers .
negative	especially in a business that is all about making the day of someone you love .
neutral	at first i couldn_'_t figure_out what was happening but eventually twigged and got a satisfactory result .
neutral	hi ,
negative	when my product arrived it only had one dumbell in the box which i found strange so i rang up your company and asked where the other one was and was told they are sold separately which is such a con .
negative	on over £_000 which they " borrowed " for nearly four weeks .
negative	a real_shame as the frames were lovely .
negative	customer service were friendly and helpful , but it was lip service and they wre unable to delvier .
negative	we got to the airport , were looking_forward to the holiday and - boom .
negative	this company are ripping_people off !
negative	firstly , i definitely did redeem both of them and secondly the money has_been taken out for the product so i am confused as to whether i will get the product or not ?
negative	i wont let it drop but please everyone avoid this company , anyone can make a mistake and fail to deliver , i know they reply on florists .
negative	the best thing in this story ( which was not as good for me ) is that although the packeges arrived at the same time i was charged three_times for p and p .
negative	having received a message at 00 . 00am to say that the replacement flowers were on the delivery vehicle and a further confirmation as follows_:
positive	i am very satisfied with the service .
positive	i looked at age_partnership online as it came up in a google_search & the quotes they were offering were good in comparison with other_companies .
negative	i ordered three parcels to be picked_up on the same day from this company .
positive	as with all the people i have put their way .
positive	i ordered a bespoke design , sent an image i hoped would be ok , and a few_days_later i have a perfect little rubber stamp made just for me .
positive	i can ’_t say enough good things about them .
negative	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via_groupon , 0_weeks before christmas ; waited 0_weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before christmas .
positive	very fast , can '_t complain_about anything .
neutral	at_least one photo should have warned me that the quality was not good enough .
negative	!
positive	my husband was sooooo pleased with the thumb slide business card case , and the free engraving ; his other directors were so jealous they asked me to order for them also , a great compliment to your company .
neutral	the recipient was very happy with the flowers , however , i thought the container did not look like a large basket and i have been trying to find out if in fact it was a large .
positive	advice was free and plentiful .
positive	however , there was not a murmur when i had to return the first spectacles .
neutral	!
neutral	so all in all products fine , but not scoring big on communication with customers or speedy delivery .
positive	their prices and service are excellent compared to most main street jewellers .
positive	i have been dealing_with flyers for years , this is the first time i have used flyerzone .
negative	a few_months later i order 0 more tyres as the fronts now need doing .
neutral	when i placed my order it was quick and easy .
positive	thank u very much for wat u did

negative	thanks a bunch parcel0go , 00 years to get 000_% 0000 + feedback and then i suffer this incompetence .
positive	my order arrived within 0 working_days , the product is fantastic and has worked_brilliantly , very happy customer will buy from here in future .
neutral	hasn_'_t worked for me so although delivery prompt , i '_m disappointed
negative	the delivery cost , which you have to pay for as there is no local shop to where i live , on top of the product which i have just paid a fortune for and with no means of tracking , except for leaving the printing press .
positive	0 .
positive	an excellent , easy web_site , lots of options and easy to navigate .
positive	no_problems_whatsoever
negative	however i received a claim_form for lost parcels and was told they couldn_'_t fulfil my delivery as parcel was lost !
positive	paul
neutral	good tickets but at double the actual price .
negative	after receiving 00 quotes for a seatbelt , i asked the top 0 best rated suppliers for a photo .
neutral	the worst thing about them was the endless calls from 0 trying to sell me another phone or contract , they would go through periods of ringing me four times a day for a week until i answered it !!
negative	too late .
negative	i paid £_00 for a pair of shoes that are too small , i need to return - which is a common enough problem .
positive	they are always quick to respond and good value for money .
negative	very very poor service .
neutral	my wife had front tyres_fitted and she asked for them to be swapped with the rear_tyres as recommended by the manufacturer .
negative	my advice to anyone_thinking of using them : don_'_t give them any contact details under any circumstances , unless of course you enjoy having your inbox filled with spam .
positive	good service .
positive	we are delighted with our carpetvista rug .
positive	good value , as_described , free delivery and arrived next_day
positive	i would buy from shoes_international again but i think i would ask for the dimensions before placing an order .
positive	i found the website more informative than any other i looked on , and the prices competitive .
neutral	pethetic excuse .
negative	looked like a small bunch of flowers of instead of the wreath pictured on website .
neutral	i ordered a pc which was delivered next_day ,
negative	he then took my coffee_machine , ragging it around with no care as he tried to shove it in the box .
negative	not only did the website of this company crash , for a full day , but i have now been informed by [_external link_removed_] that this company have cancelled the order and will no_longer fulfil it .
negative	quicker to leave a note at residential addresses so drivers can get their round done in time .
negative	when we got there , firstly it was difficult to locate the transfer car that was taking us to the car_hire location .
negative	ordered £_00 worth of roses to be delivered on valentines_day to my wifes work which is in a prominent west_end location .
positive	i have ordered major kitchen_appliances twice_now from ao and found it hassle_free with a good range of products and the best competitive_prices .
negative	the tap was delivered on yet another day and eventually had to be delivered to our neighbour due to taps uk '_s inability to co -_ordinate deliveries .
positive	there were a huge_amount of products to choose from , really helping to inspire our 00 '_s night costumes .
positive	holds everything you need .
positive	oh and they do samples too . and give you one free in your order !
positive	good value price .
positive	my overall experience with mr_central_heating was excellent and would highly_recommend .
neutral	disappointingly it turned_out this was an internet only product ( i didn_'_t spot anything which said that ) and the assistant i spoke to was quite offhand about it (" we don_'_t have the room to stock everything ") even_though i '_d made the trip specially .
negative	i would never use them again , ever .
negative	i tried the website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
negative	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
positive	i bought batman and robin outfits as gifts for my friend '_s boys .
negative	£_00 headlamps too low £_00 to re set them .
neutral	the correct ones have now arrived over a week_later .
neutral	bedeck got no sale .
neutral	i was happy to use them a lot until massive price increase in 0000
neutral	order went through apparently dispatched , had to ring to check after some time had passed .
positive	the food was amazing , couldn_'_t_believe i was eating a ready_meal !
negative	so went threw all internet forms and sent the thing
neutral	0rd time using service .
neutral	0rd bean_bag stated it was going to be sent week_commencing 0 - 0 - 00 , emailed infurm on 0th_january to ask for update on my order .
negative	there are many other_providers of photobooks and i guess the old saying ' you get what you pay for ' sums up my experience .
negative	i rang them , quite politely informed them that this was not so .
neutral	order arrived really quickly , however some items were smaller_than_expected and i do not think they are worth price paid , also when i first looked on the site that day it said free brio watch on order over a i think £_00 but by the time i came to placing my order this offer had disappeared and i got a free leg wipe thing in a shoddy looking packet .
neutral	( added £_00 ) & then went on to say that the brake oil required flushing and replacing at a cost of £_00 .
positive	very good service at a competative price compared with other online sites , would recommend to a friend .
positive	i ordered an item from this seller , but was concerned that the original delivery date had slipped by several days .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered for a friends birthday , when they had not arrived by 0pm i rang customer_services to be told that they had not been able to find a florist to deliver my order .
negative	about a week_later my father got a partial_refund of £_000 . 00 .
positive	great shoes or trainers !
negative	scam !!!
negative	so they do have the tyres , then they dont have the tyres , then they do have them again , then actually they dont have them !
neutral	i have used this company before and been very pleased with all_aspects .
negative	they must have been thrown over the fence .

neutral	on the first evening we ate at the blue_ribbon restaurant , and the food was excellent , but the waiter tried to sell us wine at £_00 . 00 per bottle and made us feel like paupers for having cheaper bottles .
neutral	however , eleven days after ordering , the battery arrived , fits_perfectly , was recognised by my lap - top , and so_far , works as it should .

neutral	beware as this has signifantly dumped up the price as i have had order another pair but this time used another company / website .

positive	would recommend tyreleader great service and prices .
negative	one final note is the sheer_amount of emails i receive from yourselves around 0 a day minimum , the fact u bombard people with emails will probably make them not want to purchase things off you .
neutral	then she had to call several more times to get the web link to put her voucher_code in , despite_being told by several different customer service reps that they were definitely sending it .
neutral	the christmas_tree was a lovely touch but the room in which we ate dinner had nothing at all , as it also did not have much natural light due to a wall near to the window so it made christmas_dinner very uneventful and sad .

positive	the whole_process was seamless from ordering to delivery - the delivery team had to remove the doors of the appliance to get it into the house - this was carried_out without_any_problems .
negative	i will look_forward to being_able to update this review in another 0 months when the replacement hopefully arrives .
positive	cherise kept me up to date with both my requests and helped_me through the purchase process .
negative	do not use them .
positive	express_watches had the best online price for the watch i ' d chosen .
negative	i ordered my flowers for the 0th on the website .
negative	more understandable , but my cell phone does not do international .
positive	thank_you .
positive	with every other website i '_ve tried my iphone never completely stays unlocked but with official_iphone_unlock now it '_s locked for good !
positive	this is the first time i have attempted to do this and as was promised it was extremely easy to use .
negative	i called and explained the issue only to be told to complete a form , no_probs there .
positive	a good choise of tyres to suit all_budgets , the ordering_process was easy and booking a day to suit you was ideal .
neutral	i have kept her terse emails , and vowed as a result not to use pro_cook again .
negative	speedtester works ok , but when tweeting results , the url link to the results takes you to a page not found and the not results page .
positive	not the cheapest for all the batteries i required at the time so i didn_'_t order everything i needed from battery_force .
positive	great delivery service too .
neutral	reading other people '_s orders , seems as though they need to work on their supply_chain .
neutral	i like the idea of quality natural_wood products and this is why i purchased from oakfurnitureland .
negative	i ordered birthday flowers , carefully choosing a bouquet with no lillies , as our daughter has cats . our daughter sent me a picture on face book , clearly showing a bunch of flowers that bore_no_resemblance to what i ordered , containing lillies . i have e_mailed the company to complain but have not had a reply .
negative	on 00 december i e_- mailed ihampers to express my displeasure and only received a reply on 0 january offering me a 0 pound voucher off my next purchase - obviously a very safe offer as they are probably only too well aware it will be the last time i use their service .
neutral	prices not increased too much .
neutral	i waited_till the morning after 0 am and was hoping someone would answer the phone .
positive	it makes_sense to me .
positive	excellent all_round customer service
positive	brilliant service couldn_'_t fault it , whiskey and vodka delivered well_packaged and on date stated , does exactly_what it says on the tin .
positive	one small problem quickly dealt witth .
neutral	i remember when signing_up to payment sense i was told i could terminate the contract anytime .
negative	never again will i use them for anything !
negative	i '_ve ordered 0 bunches of flowers through them and 0 just didn_'_t turn_up !
positive	we will certainly be looking to marks_electrical for our next purchase , a replacement cooker and hob .
neutral	i was looking for a suitable gift for my mothers_birthday who had recently_moved some 000_miles_away .
negative	your staff asked for a photo as evidence of the breakage !
negative	if you buy from this company - i prey they have the goods in stock for you , cause if they dont - your in for a very , very long wait and do not expect a refund from simpy .
neutral	how many britons work during the day and are therefore not able to sign for parcels ?
neutral	not enough time to return for a new one so just kept it , shame for the price it cost .
positive	i couldn_'_t have been more impressed with the speed of delivery of the item purchased , especially at this time of year .
negative	in the store the wardrobe was easily dismantled which was what i was after due to living in a small cottage with limited access .
neutral	just left me hopping from foot to foot wondering what was going on .
positive	essentially i shall return to mr_memory for future upgrades ; should i remember ( sorry long day ).
negative	i was willing to wait as not urgent .
negative	update oct0th
positive	easy to order - pretty quick delivery but would think a 00 hour delivery could be achieved - would save the plumber from tearing his hair out !
neutral	delivery of 0 - 0_weeks was a bit_slow though .
positive	chris was so helpful and get knowledgeable , pleasure to deal with .
negative	i oredered a miss chamilia braclet for my nieces_birthday .
positive	thankyou so much
positive	the goods arrived quickly and well_packaged .
positive	!
neutral	i booked top price stalls and we certainly got what we wanted , 0 rows from the stage for less_than the advertised box office price .
negative	i sent the following email on the supposed day of the delivery and had no response " our order has not been delivered to us . i have been in the house waiting , and note that your previous email stated a delivery time between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
neutral	their selection and stock_levels are excellent and their prices have always been ok , but this last order , for a pair of sebago docksides , suffered from slow dispatch and delivery .
positive	i now do not have to over worry_about losing the only key , as i now have two spares .
neutral	slight_problem in the fact the website didn_'_t choose the dates i selected , i changed them but forgot to make_sure i still had selected the right destination of cover .
positive	once i sent my phone payment was received three_days after_posting .
positive	i '_ve said it all in the opinion in one_sentence , the items were at a good price , they were delivered quickly , communications were excellent , and i got what i ordered , great .
negative	absolutely nothing like it .
positive	the person on the other end of the telephone knew what i was talking_about immediately , and processed my order efficiently .
neutral	cheaper_than getting him to come_back yet another day .
positive	delivery was quick and email_notifications let_me know what was happening with my order .
neutral	as a result we had to put ourselves in great danger and take it up ourselves .
positive	? brilliant service and would definately recomend to everyone !
neutral	have never had this difficulty with other capsules .
negative	i look_forward to seeing them in court .
positive	andy bacon
positive	i will definitely order from chocolatetradingco . com again .
negative	don_'_t believe their tales .
neutral	the aftershave is for a present next week so if it doesn_'_t arrive this week clearly it '_s lost and there won_'_t be time for me to order it in time !!!
negative	such a shame i have been a lovefilm member for a number of years and really loved the service , the site was easy to navigate and user_friendly .
negative	yet they '_ve sent me this feedback form to complete despite all my emas of complaint !
neutral	never rated a company before on the web .
positive	good pricing , great product !
positive	this item is brilliant and would not_hesitate to buy another , and if you are reading this get one bought .
neutral	they offer good products at a good price just the only thing that lets them down is the period the item takes to get to you , not sure you '_ll want to wait :/ you may want to pay £ 0 extra o get a quicker delivery from else where .
negative	neither are we - we won_'_t use them or any of their partner companies again .
neutral	the selection of products was brilliant , and site navigation and the shopping_experience were really easy , then the products arrived quite quickly ( though a bit later than initially stated ).
negative	i haven_'_t the energy to continue quite_frankly .
negative	not at all happy and not the way to treat customers !
positive	had what i wanted , price was good and delivery excellant .
positive	james was a massive help .
negative	i waited 0_days for my order to then be told the items were out of stock and the site had no idea when items would become available .
neutral	for flight_sim kit , not worth the bother .
neutral	flowers lovely .
neutral	they felt grubby and dated , especially the stained shower curtains and the thick dust on top of the mirrors .
positive	so easy to do and arrived within a couple of days .
negative	i complained afterwards and asked for a refund but i was told as long as i could only send back the faulty balloons but not the empty helium_canister , which we had of course discarded the same day already , they would not refund anything .
positive	i would certainly recommend them and look_forward to selling them another ipad in the near_future .
positive	best price on the net .
positive	delivery on time .
positive	great service .
negative	do not use this company if you want a reliable service .
neutral	very disappointed :(
positive	my only_complaint would be the added cost to shipping when you select free items , but really it is a small price to pay .
positive	people at work comment on what i '_m wearing .
neutral	my dressing_table was easy to order but the original delivery date wasn_'_t honoured .
negative	ordered an oven_element on 00nd_april , finally delivered on 0rd may .
neutral	lucozade sport with caffine , but the jelly beans are still good , even if one has to order them in industrial quantities .
neutral	he offered no apology or explanation for the delay .
neutral	but you don_'_t allow two letter names !
negative	after a week i received an e_mail saying one of the items was out of stock ( even_though when i checked on their site it was still available to purchase ).
negative	my order has not yet arrived , i have asked where it is but have had no response since i completed the order not recived form , i have e_mailed again so we will see what happens .
neutral	it '_s really not cool .
negative	i emailed 0 times and still nothing !
neutral	we sent flowers to my mum for her_birthday so did not see them arrive , but according to my dad ( who received the delivery ) the orchids were bruised as they had been sent in a box that did not support them as it was too_big .
negative	" the best customer service and after - sale service comes as standard as far as we are concerned .
neutral	to top it all it says on the invoice that the card that made the payment needs to be presented when she attends to get the tyres_fitted !
positive	i decided to give it a go because of the great low price and free delivery from_hong_kong !!!
negative	no one from customer_services informed me my order would be late - in the mean time the money has_been debited from my account .
negative	advice to walls and floors customer_services : accept the fact that some complaints may be genuine and at first point of call , when an irate customer asks to speak to a manager , don_’_t make inflammatory comments .
negative	last_week 00_mins late this week 0 hours late .
positive	fantastic website - very easy to use and find what you require .
negative	really horrible experience .
neutral	the flute works and produces a good quality sound , but due to it being an ex_display and discounted , i felt it would be more hastle to return it as this was probably the last one and i would be asked to pay the difference for a new one , which i can '_t afford .
negative	so they gained an extra £_00 . 00 . i will never see that .
neutral	a good idea and very flexible self - editing tools - more choice of size would be good .
neutral	i run a business myself and understand profit_margins , but some of hc '_s are crazy
neutral	poor quality for a lot of money .
positive	good follow_up service .
neutral	did what it said on the tin , no problem
neutral	it arrived quickly but wasn_'_t the shape i ' d ordered .
negative	called them and person i spoke to was very helpful ( and embarrassed about how far i '_d have to travel to collect from their depot ) but ok have to accept .
negative	i am incredibly unhappy with this service and it seems i am unlikely to ever see the money or products again .
positive	easy to do , exceptional choices and fantastic rewards
negative	stick to groupon and living_social - they actually value their customers
negative	timed delivery equals a timed delivery and not just drive off as i have it from security that no one attempted to deliver .
negative	i have asked for a refund but they won_'_t give me one as they say that they will be only be billed by_fedex , despite the policy on both_parties saying that if the parcel is not delivered within the reasonable time_scale they will refund .
negative	plus all i knew i will be home all day so i '_ve paid_extra for the saturday delivery !
neutral	whilst happy with things that work , i have had many bits that only work for a week or so , and can only put down to cheap chinese labour , and the 0 day return_policy is rubbish cos if you buy a box of cartomizors and only 0 out of 0 work , you are stuffed .
negative	i emailed again on 00st to advise that it was still not here and the adviser told me that it would be with me by 00th_november .
positive	ordered on - line and received immediate_confirmation of order .
negative	i ordered a bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend for valentines_day .
positive	i would recomend cheap_smells for value and speed of service .
positive	the rest have gone in the bin !
negative	if you are a seller be very , very careful indeed whenever accepting payment via this company .
positive	would highly_recommend phonebank
neutral	but for some reason when you enter address it somehow changed on both delivery address and billing_address .
positive	no problem recommending this company to anyone i will certainly use them again .
positive	we were very surprised he had them in stock , as promised , the controller arrived the next evening at about 00 . 00hrs .
negative	what a joke !
negative	i think that '_s appauling customer service .
positive	the price has always been good compared to other_companys and alterations to the itnerary have always been promt and fully_explained .
neutral	i really feel averaging insignificant and significant criteria makes the whole review system frivolous .
neutral	i tried again .
positive	you will get the best possible products with helpful and friendly advice .
negative	" confirmed at : 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 ( this can sometimes be quite a bit later than the actual time the flowers arrived )"
positive	good customer service would use again .
positive	i did lots of comparisons online and although i found other_places which could match the smaller bottles ( which had 00 - 00_%_off ) no where was close to matching the price of the bigger bottles which had 00_%_off !
positive	i choose serenata_flowers for their very reasonable_price and thought maybe the product itself and the service may reflect this , however i was pleasantly_surprised they surpassed my expectations !
negative	i called again about 00 days ago and was assured that one of the two products was already in stock and the other was on its way and would be with them in the 00rd_june .
negative	is that a joke ?!
neutral	it was 00am .
positive	i shall definitely be using this website again !
neutral	i '_ve purchased suits in store and the customer service and quality has_been fantastic .
positive	i found bedeck through googling sanderson bedding and have no_complaints .
neutral	nice villa shame about the location !
negative	the woman i spoke to said she would call me after finding out what was going on , but i didn_'_t receive any call back .
positive	they were really helpful and put me at ease straight_away .
negative	firms you deal with are rubbish ; as is your ordering system .
negative	i will now have to seek tyres from somewhere more trustworthy , please issue an immediate_refund and confirm .
neutral	this doesn_'_t seem to have been fixed at all , as i had exactly the same problem .
positive	overall , great products , great prices and great delivery .
neutral	i will try this website once again because of the value if not i will return to my regular website .
negative	i have many an item just slung over my fence and in to the back garden even_though i have complained on several_occassions .
positive	i ordered a kit for christmas prezzie and it came within a few_days .
positive	i placed an order for a black sleeveless dress for my wife on friday_evening , expecting to get the item within a few_days .
neutral	to be fair their ups delivery was easy to follow on tracking except that i had an email to say it would be delivered wednesday and it came tuesday_lunchtime - fortunately someone was present to receive the goods ( not 000golf '_s fault of course ).
neutral	the site was relatively clear and easy to use but i would not describe the prices as ' discount '.
negative	when we wanted to return something , there were so many penalty / restocking fees it countered the cost of the items strangely .
neutral	i then contacted gamesbite via_email and jax got in touch with the code which was in perfect working order .
negative	i shall be providing negative_feedback on your feedback form very soon and i will also warn my friends and family about your company and any ' flower delivery forums '.
neutral	the tiles are lovely and the price was good , but when we received the tiles a third of the tiles where broken both types of tiles i ordered .
negative	as my avon brochure is my shop window i dont want to put creased bags on my brochures as it creates a bad impression .
neutral	tom .
neutral	bought everything i needed from this shop .
negative	have bought lots of things from hotroxuk without_any_problems . then the first time i did have a problem with a pedalboard that i purchased they were absolutely_hopeless . i kept e_- mailing them but didn_'_t receive a single response - evenually after e_- mailing the manager on his personal e_- mail address i got a reply , but by this time i had sorted_out the problems at my own_expense - this has_been amongst the worst customer service that i have ever received !
neutral	took 0 heavy_parcels back to depot - sent us a letter ( kemba still missing ) which got here , and we had to phone premium tel .
negative	i complained to them online as they conveniently have no telephone_number available to contact them with .
negative	unfortunately as we assembled the unit we were unable to return it so have had to put it somewhere different to where we wanted to , it is a great unit just not matching as stated , so a complete_waste of £_000 .
negative	thank_you for your understanding thus_far and we look_forward to completing your refund soon .
negative	i wanted to switch because talk_talk '_s provided wireless_router is poor quality and they do not offer support on privately provided routers .
neutral	i understand that stock is delayed but it would have been good to receive an_email keeping us posted on progress as we had paid for them at the time of ordering .
neutral	am now awaiting return of 0 faulty polo_shirts - but they have called and emailed regarding the items .
negative	my advice ?
positive	( saved almost £_00 on two new tyres compared to my garage who had given me their best price ) from previous experience fitting was trouble_free .
negative	i order flowers for delivery all the time as we don_'_t live in the uk and this is the first time i am using prestige and it will be my last .
negative	the order status was showing as still to be processed so i called them to find out why it was taking so long .
positive	for four reasons :
positive	the delivery was amazingly fast .
neutral	hopefully they will have learnt from the customer service experience .
negative	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
positive	definitely recommend them to anyone looking for formal_wear .
positive	!
neutral	the thing that let the whole_experience down for me was the fitting_centre .
neutral	my first dealings with parcel0go and so_far my parcel hasn_'_t been picked_up .
positive	delivery excellent .
neutral	it took me almost an_hour to remove the horrible labels from each item of cutlery - please would you add easy - peel labels rather_than the paper ones that eventually required resorting to the use of label - remover to get them off , which probably also removed a little of the shiny surface of the cutlery .
negative	the most_recent ' attempt ' states that the driver could not gain primary access to my property .
positive	this is the second time i '_ve bought from spartoo and once again brilliant service from_start to finish , competitive_prices , good quality items , speedy delivery - what more could one ask for ?
neutral	in my opinion this is shoddy service from someone_who supplies a very specialist product .
negative	two_days_later i returned the vehicle , well within the time allocation , i had thought there would be a garage close to the airport , but i didn_’_t see one .
negative	i ordered a basket of flowers for my mother who went to donegal for the weekend at short_notice .
neutral	furniture is as good as it looks in the showroom and the service at the store was really good .
negative	i will not be using this site again because i feel i cannot trust what i thought i ordered will be delivered if i have to read the small_print every time i place an order .
positive	i haven_'_t used any of the inks yet but if they are as good as the service i am sure i will be delighted .
negative	i '_m just one customer they have tried to rip_off . how many vulnerable customers are out there who don_'_t actually notice debt being added on their meters ???
negative	it wouldn_'_t tell how much is too much and is really vague but sends a warning on the only occasion i was able to watch ( just about ) world_cup footy despite constant buffering that i will be banned next time if i don_'_t stop using a service that eats too much data !
positive	thanks for a great service !!!
positive	!
neutral	after 0_days i had heard_nothing so i emailed them again and posted my review on trust_pilot .
positive	would recommend company to friends and others and would deal with them again without_hesitation .
neutral	if you continue to advertise these apartments as being 0_star , when they don_'_t really deserve that rating , guests may continue to book them but may feel misled when they get there and experience what '_s really on offer .
positive	just waiting for discount wednesday !
neutral	i then called wowcher on the phone and was told to wait for the other two to arrive as they had been redeemed on different dates - they weren_'_t !
negative	it was at this point that i started to feel uneasy .
positive	the haberdashery store is outstanding too , the amount of products they have is endless .
positive	would definately recommend .
negative	could not wait to see them for real .
neutral	i use it to search hotels in the area .
negative	the company is awful , good luck to anyone returning faulty goods because the return_policy is not worth the paper its written on .
positive	i have used the garage in the past and will use the garage again in the future for fitting tyres , mot " s , servicing and general problems .
neutral	the flowers looked ok on the image on site . but i was quite disappointed and embarrassed with what arrived at my friends house .
neutral	this was an accepted mistake which was rectified quickly .
positive	thanks .
negative	i have since flown and come_back only to see that i '_ve been charged an additional £_00 .
positive	my vacuum was the best price that i could find any where online .
neutral	again , not the end of the world that they arrived a day early , but also not the service i paid for .
neutral	it '_s not suitable packaging for delivery of this product from kite_packaging .
positive	lots of choice , lovely products and excellent delivery service !
positive	really pleased with the rocking_horse can '_t wait to see my little_ones face on christmas morning thanks to precious_little_ones for such a prompt hassle_free service .
negative	we have done nothing wrong other than the fact we have not succeeded in this venture , but if you wish to try and blacken our name in other ventures where we have different partners that have not been involved in house0market that is up to you and we can not stop you doing this .
neutral	yes , it may make it simpler to code the ordering system that way , but it seems in no way necessary .
positive	have been using feedem for several_years to buy food for my dog .
neutral	as i am a firm believer in second chances , i told them to either make_sure my item arrived by the 00nd or give me a refund .
neutral	despite_assurances of replacement i still have not received .
positive	i was looking for a smaller length bed to fit into my sons_bedroom .
positive	these were well produced and arrived in my hands 00_hours or so later - in plenty of time for the party where they were a big hit !
positive	would definitely use again in the future and will recommend to others .
positive	when unwrapped the tree looked healthy and of a nice shape .
neutral	of 00 begonia value plugs only 0 have survived .
positive	no luxuries here , but the site is easy to use , the pricing is honest and its great value .
neutral	i live in spain and the medication my dog requires is very expensive here .
neutral	i really liked the range of products on offer and everything came quickly and in good condition .
negative	i say apparently because i had no phonecalls to say the delivery was coming out to me .
negative	so i went down on a saturday_morning at my earliest convenience to collect package and was surprised to find they had sent it back to sender within a week .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone
positive	i will always use serenata .
negative	i did so .
neutral	had to go to a local guess dealer to get it resized .
positive	!
negative	the other items were dirty and had been repackaged badly .
positive	i will definitely use you again .
neutral	i left the car with them and received a call an_hour later to say that the wrong tyres had been delivered , h rating rather_than the v rating i ordered .
neutral	!
negative	i have used serenata a number of times but have never seen the product .
neutral	i bought tickets through getmein via ticket_master , as it stated it was a sister site !
positive	found the site very easy to use .
positive	i found the service very good indeed .
negative	this was last_year .
positive	excellent delivery .
negative	the worst one i had so_far .
neutral	ok value for money - big impersonal stores with high turn over of staff .
negative	such a con of a website and a copout response from viagogo - never again will i use them .
positive	i would definitely recommend the gite to all my friends .
positive	i ordered the korg midi_keyboard and to be honest was a bit_worried considering the negative_reviews i had seen - but they were dispelled .
negative	the item that i ordered was never delivered .
negative	sponsors print quality was shocking !!!!!!
positive	always seem to have very good prices and efficient fitting service at national_tyres .
negative	does this company not communicate with each other ?
negative	was very disappointed with my purchase , waste of money and will not be purchasing again !
positive	i had ordered something from another store online at same time and paid £ 0 . 00 for two day delivery with other store .
positive	thank_you from hertfordshire golf .
negative	hiya
negative	paid for the same day delivery .
positive	my order from muscle_foods arrived on time and was very well_packed , and the chicken was well prepared so it was just a case of putting it in the freezer .
positive	had used excel for many_years but learnt lots of things i didn_'_t know were there , also lots of shortcuts .
neutral	dog_wormer good price but 0 / 0 an order is no good to me as ive now to got to re - order again & time is money
negative	thanks for the offer of the possible weekend in edinburgh , but you were no able to supply me with the part i needed , despite advertising them on your web_site , however i appreciated the prompt reply .
negative	having placed an online order four_weeks_ago , it was only when i emailed them that i was informed my order had been cancelled .
positive	this was a helpful website which i will use again if_necessary
negative	i had an extremely disappointing experience with eye - sale .
negative	i cancelled my order and requested a refund which apparently takes 0 days !
neutral	i am not a hotel agent so i only gave the information they wanted when they asked .
neutral	unfortunately it went to the deafault choice which is europe !
neutral	i would appreciate your findings in respect to ths matter .
neutral	on hold for over 00_minutes , with some additional waiting while the operator attempted to find out what was happening .
neutral	but my straighteners took 0 days to arrive and that was only because i e_mailed and rang ghd and parcel_force then rang parcel_force again .
positive	excellent service as always
neutral	still happy with the final product though .
neutral	this should have been done before they left the lab .
neutral	store , for quickness on installing the item .
negative	that it is not their responibility if the flowers have not yet arrived .
positive	they make doing my tapestry so much_easier to see .
positive	it was my third time using sun_transfers and i '_d recommend them to everyone .
positive	came really quickly and well_packaged .
neutral	therefore we made the sales persons job very easy .
positive	i have always been a bit_nervous_about picking the right company for this job as you hear many ' horror ' stories . well i '_m very glad i picked safestyle , and it makes me smile every time i pull up to my house to see it looking so good !
positive	clear_instructions everything worked as_described .
negative	i spent an_hour trying to book flights through this site ; every time i got to payment after entering full details for 0 passengers , the site would fail .
negative	support_team where unhelpful and not interested in listening to the problems i encountered .
negative	0 . try to rip you off ,
negative	phone support expensive and ineffective and guess_what the manager is not there or the department is closed .
negative	i had to chase the refund twice before it eventually arrived back into my account .
neutral	the mulled_wine and mince_pies which had been promised by the blue_chip website had become a standard bottle of wine and some biscuits , once again no festive touch at all and to be honest disappointing , id rather not be promised anything .
positive	great value for money and options of wetsuits .
positive	will definitely buy from again .
positive	keep_up the good work , service as it should be
neutral	please contact me asap to explain the rental cost differences_between the price paid through yourselves online and the final price i was charged .
negative	i had a pay - as - you - go contract with them .
neutral	far from ideal .
neutral	not up to usual standard , however guess that its still a better option than picking_up the yellow_pages and taking pot_luck
neutral	a couple of the handles do not fit properly and are loose .
neutral	it was too late by that time so i had to accept .
negative	!
positive	took my crappy broken phone and gave_me £_00 !
positive	plumbworld was easy to deal with so i '_m looking at them for a forthcoming bathroom refurb .
positive	excellent service and really fast delivery .
positive	very helpful young_lady advised that my parcels would be delivered the following_day and to ring in the morning to obtain a time .
negative	no contact , no nothing .
negative	quite simply , it doesn_'_t .
positive	doreen
neutral	i had very friendly conversations with enquiries and on - line staff .
positive	delivery can take up to 0_weeks as they come from_hong_kong but that wasn_'_t a problem for me .
negative	!
neutral	one passenger in the queue phoned airport_parking on his mobile asking for more buses to be put into service and was told this was not possible , which did not help our mood standing in the rain getting wet .
positive	good price , did it at work .
positive	i bought a buzz 0 package including pram , car_seat and push_chair .
negative	i have emailed and sent letters to no_avail .
negative	where should i start ?
negative	leslie
positive	recommend without_hesitation
neutral	offerered to get them off for £_00 and then i would have had to have them replaced !!!
positive	great communication
negative	time without number i have tried to buy items from argos and they never seem to have what i want in stock either in store or on their website .
negative	this time i was promised a call within 00_hrs .
positive	i would not_hesitate to recommend others to use this company .
positive	excellent service thank_you !
neutral	used it online .
negative	where do i begin in january this year me and my husband decided wed like a change from the car we had a chevrolet kalos which we also purchased from stoneacre and said we never would again after the problems we had with the kalos anyway we thought wed try them again what a mistake they couldnt do us a deal on what we wanted so the salesman phoned us up the following_day said hed found us a nice car that he could do us a deal on so off we went to look at it it was a renault_megane it was lovely so we bought it what a mistake the car went in about 0 times first time it was just little things like heater control and a few bulbs didnt work when the car was repaired we picked it up only to find that the mechanics had damaged the centre console so it went back to have a new one fitted got the car back again had it a few_days and the gearbox started having problems so the car went back to be repaired again this continued for the next 0 month in the end finance and stoneacre decided we could change the car to a fiat_panda low and behold this has_been a nightmare in and out of stoneacres for repairs only had the car 0_months and its been in for repair 0 times already to which there saying they cant find anything wrong with it but we get it back and the following_day the problem starts again we paid for a life time guarantee on the megane only to find out we had to pay another life time guarantee when we got the panda bearing in mind we only had the megane 0_months i just dont_think this is fair why couldnt they have transferred the guarantee from the megane onto the panda for goodwill but no they wont they have ended costing us more money because the panda was less money than the megane the situation now is were so fed_up because they now want us to take the car in and let the mechanic have it a few_days to see if the problem_occurs while in his hands or they will buy the car back for a reduced price of what we paid for it we are now looking elsewhere as the problem is still persisting all we want is a car we can_rely_on dont_think weve been treated fair at all
negative	could not recommend them
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	thanks
positive	the trouble was that i needed a brushed_steel finish , four way switch , with two of the switches on dimmers to handle low_voltage led_lights .
negative	i '_m glad it wasn_'_t me that went out to ask the guy .
negative	i still have not received them 00 days after order .
neutral	none of these applied to myself .
positive	the process was very easy and in my opinion , very efficient as it arrived when you said it would .
neutral	so a thumbs_up for some aspects of petsupermarket but a big_thumbs down for the bits that are not up to scratch .
neutral	the express delivery service that you opted for unfortunately does not
neutral	only a so - so review as after waiting a week for delivery i found out that the item hadn_'_t been dispatched .
positive	if your paitent and have your ticket ready to scan your fine !
negative	i have now sent two emails with no reply , i made a purchase online of flowers , vase , balloon and card for my friend , once i paid i got a receipt to say there was truffles added which i didn_'_t order .
positive	vast_array of things to order ( from amazon & market place ).
positive	the only_downside was the trek from the airport - next time we '_ll take the cases on a trolley !
negative	crap - not a good start
negative	!
negative	like myself , become ' ex customers ' their plans are totally out of proportion and the more people who vote by spending their cash elsewhere , the better !
positive	received the glasses in perfect_condition and very quickly after ordering .
negative	rubbish on the shelves , with misserable desperate people doing their weekly_shop , for anything cheap .
neutral	after some to and froing and significant delays in mail responses this was accepted but far from the original next_day delivery expected !
neutral	would be reluctant to order any other items in case they also arrived damaged .
positive	no competition .
neutral	i have used cash_genie twice and they are very quick and professional .
neutral	disappointing when i have spent 00 years dealing_with stoneacre and peugeot .
positive	it was a risk for me as i hadn_'_t used this particular company in the past , but am really happy with the product itself and the distribution / packaging and would thoroughly_recommend and will be using them again !
neutral	when i sent back samples showing and then contacted them again they admitted they had made a spelling_mistake and new cards would be printed .
positive	so , i eventually bought a 0 camera system ( bespoke , not a bundle ).
negative	it would have taken them a couple of minutes to sort this out , but instead they were just awkard with us .
positive	would recomend and will but again
neutral	i am a retired graphic_designer , who was at one time employed by a printing company who published books .
negative	so we contacted the company from which we bought the item .
neutral	very slow , didn_'_t get in touch with me for ages .
neutral	the tracking also showed that the parcel was delivered to 00 buckwood avenue , which was untrue , it was delivered into the hands of a workman , who i have never met , to no 00 buckwood avenue .
positive	both make great beds for having an afternoon nap on .
neutral	i am also a little unhappy that the message i requested to be in for him from his daughter wasnt included .
neutral	no card had been posted through to tell me that the delivery had been left_outside .
positive	i used their drop_off and collect service which suited me , and the recipient down to the ground .
negative	my order has not been completed even_though i have been given 0 separate delivery dates the most_recent of which was ' guaranteed ' for what that was worth .
neutral	there was a bit of a delay as it was coming from germany , although communication was always as a result of us prompting for updates .
negative	this was at 00 . 00 on the morning of the 00st .
positive	used for the first time recently and would use again .
negative	!
positive	i will most definitely recommend you .
neutral	thus keeping it safe !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	both_times the deals were misleading , listing things that weren_'_t included in the price , and both experiences were disappointing .
positive	i was very happy with the price for what i was getting which is the main_reason i bought it .
negative	another big_mistake !!
negative	mine was not a good one and would never use again .
positive	overall , great performance from tier0 .
neutral	all good but one the smoke_detectors does not work so have asked for a replacement .
neutral	good website , but sales people in their shops are really bad and rude .
neutral	poor delivery , you should use next_day as standard at the very least .
positive	the quality of the product and service received from this company total_computing was absolutely perfect and as a very satisfied customer , i wish to convey my sincere_thanks to the directors and staff .
positive	i was telephoned on monday to confirm delivery on tuesday , no online_retailer has ever done this before .
positive	it was easy to choose and order and the flowers got the big_thumbs_up .
positive	!

negative	i give them one star because it is not possible to give less .
positive	excellent customer service .
positive	i would definitely use this website again
negative	i ordered on 00 jan_0000 , today is 00 feb_0000 and i still don_'_t have my order .
negative	paid for it .
negative	you need to consider providing better lines of communication !
negative	we have been in all day !!
neutral	system is great .
negative	0 days_later i received an email_confirming it had been delivered - long_story_short and numerous_calls later i was assured they had cancelled the contract , they were aware a new phone had been fraudulently obtained by another person and i would hear nothing further .
negative	we took so many days off from work sitting in the flat , waiting for an engineer to not turn_up , that we weren_'_t able to go on a holiday .
neutral	the flowers looked beautiful .
neutral	included in which was supposed to be a set of sony stereo dj headphones .
negative	when i said the word " cancel " they responded within the hour .
negative	i requested and was given a delivery date twice , and arranged to stay home from 0am to 0pm , but the the parcel did not show up
neutral	i ordered some small batteries for a led lamp i use with a magnifying_glass for close sewing work .
negative	we appealed the decision but still nothing .
negative	appalling customer service , i would not recommend using this company .
neutral	worktop_express lost my email ?, even_though they remembered to take my money .
negative	i call this sharp_practice and have no confidence to shop there any more .
negative	they didn_'_t reply .
positive	well this was the cheapest i found on the internet of
positive	after being shown a variety of styles , we went away to think about what we wanted ( and to visit those other pushy retailers for comparison ).
positive	delivered on time every time .
neutral	tuesday '_s email said it would arrive between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00pm .
positive	very happy with my purchase and delighted with the service of sunglasses_shop .
positive	customer friendly website .
neutral	if you don_'_t they try to sell it to you for a varied amount but a lot more than £_00 .
positive	i wisk more companies would have a ' buy british ' promotion .
neutral	we must acknowledge that the next_day a portable heater was provided by the owners for our parents room .
positive	love ther clothes
neutral	i just couldn_'_t understand_why it took soooooo long !!!!
positive	me ?
neutral	- so i wrote a short while after the arrival of the flowers , but within a couple of days , the roses were withering and the display had to be thrown out before the end of the week , which was a disappointment .
positive	i '_d definetly use mazuma in the future .
negative	i bought a sofa in store with a new laura_ashley credit_card , but cancelled within the 00 hour_window .
negative	they contacted me to tell me they couldn_'_t supply , offered a number of alternatives at much higher cost that were far cheaper on amazon and wouldn_'_t price match .
positive	i needed a pair of prescription_sunglasses in a hurry .
negative	ein unkostenbeitrag wäre akzeptabel aber nicht fr .
neutral	i left the site , checked my email ( nothing from loco0 . com ) and tried again .
neutral	payment debited_immediately which concerned me as i '_d never used the company before .

positive	they made everything every easy and straight_forward in terms of postage and packaging .
positive	i couldn_'_t be_happier , nothing about this purchase was bad , a wonderful hand_written_note , perfect customer service , i '_d buy again !
positive	after an efficient check of competitor prices he recommended a 0 year deal , thus securing our prices .
negative	i tried to contact costumes service to ask for a refund it took me three_times to get though when i did they were very rude and could not help i had to ask to be put through to manager which then took another 00_minutes i was told would get my refund but would take 0_days i was with 0 friends all young girls who were left without a hotel in a foreign place . this is a absolute_joke .
neutral	while i like the idea of not being charged for your product until you are happy with it , it makes the ordering_process confusing .
positive	the ordering was easy , there was plenty of choice .
negative	expedia being the huge company that they are , would not budge to put things right that they had done wrong .
negative	!
negative	they called me next_day to inform_me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
neutral	slightly_disappointed with this , although appearance and quality of the card is very good .
neutral	told i had accepted a vehicle upgrade , taken out extra iunsurance , vat had to be paid what seemed three_times over and final_insult was being charged £_00 for 0 digital bar missing from fuel_gauge which was exactly how i got the car after turning one corner leaving the airport .
positive	a brilliant service .
neutral	the item i ordered was £_00 and a few_pence , but when i added it , i was still charged for p_&_p and was instead told free delivery only applied on orders over_£_00 .
positive	once i had registered my interest to sell online the pre_- paid_envelope arrived within 00_hours .
neutral	i have probably paid them a couple of grand but would only use them now if i was stuck .
positive	the web_site is clear and easy to navigate .
negative	would not use this service again .
negative	ordered bed , paid in full .
positive	was very clean inside and out and the performance of car was as expected for the model of car we were given .
neutral	lovely pool - just a little cold but that was a challenge .
negative	i continued to call the store ( as the stores communication was not the greatest .)
neutral	however worse than this 00 sheets ordered around 0 metres in length about 0 . 0m or so wide were delivered in a plastic_bag with no protection .
neutral	i '_ve been on the phone with overclockers rma representative yesterday and asked if the replacement / repair won_'_t resolve the issue if i can get my money back and he replied that they will have to keep sending the card back to the manufacturer for another replacement / repair until it gets resolved because i '_m with 0 days late for refund .
positive	having never used ace - fx before i approached the transaction with some caution but they were one of the few dealers who supply iceland kroner , no problem , my currency icelandic , danish and norwegian arrived_safely and exactly to time , and , i could not find better rates on the internet .
neutral	the i ordered the bra and pants set , it arrived - bra is lovely but pants are not pants but a thong , complianed to wowcher but herd nothing yet .
negative	ordered something , got it , all good there .
neutral	like other people posting here , i '_m still_waiting for my 0d_tickets for edinburgh next week .
positive	try flores_tackle first , comes highly_recommended
positive	delivery was on time and the wreath was beautifully_presented with high_quality roses , i would highly_recommend this service , thank_you .
negative	i bought a voucher for carpet cleaning and have had to chace the firm constantly they have failed to turn_up with more excuses than i have had hot dinners .
negative	i had a few games pre_- ordered with gameseek in the build up to the launch of xbox one , most of which i had also pre_- paid for as is gameseek '_s way of doing things .
neutral	couldn_'_t login as a guest for some considerable time , whatever_reason .
neutral	summary_: awfull service , i feel if i had not called and made a complaint things could have been alot worse and who_knows when i would have got my item , but once i started talking to people on the phone they seemed nice enough and got the item to me asap .
negative	they are totally unprofessional , incompetent and downright rude .
neutral	bugbear : i wish all families with babies were put in the same area of the plane , so those of us without children don_'_t have to endure ( bit_harsh ' endure ' but can '_t think of another word ) ' surround sound ' baby crying .
negative	update 00 / 00 /_0000
neutral	- order was correct
negative	i only wish i had looked out for the reviews before i used them .
neutral	will be buying from chemistdirect from now on .
positive	watch out for the cyclestore deals , too !
negative	beware
positive	fast delivery and good support !
negative	inputted my pass word as requested .
negative	the driver , who texted me his mobile number seemed unable to work his mobile , either to answer it or pick_up his messages .
neutral	left the depot only down the road from her address at 00 :_00am and didnt arrive to her until 0 :_00pm which proceeded to make my mum think i had forgotten her_birthday !
neutral	the item ordered was urgent medication for my dogs ears .
neutral	i shall order elsewhere in future , get the game early and save the £ 0 - 0 difference .
positive	haven_'_t taken it out of packaging as was a gift for my granny .
negative	her address on your delivery notification email is correct ie 0 tan y bryn , nant peris , caernarfon , ll000uh , but ( even up to today ) she has not received her flowers ( plus birthday_cake which i also ordered and paid for ).
neutral	therefore i wasn_'_t really happy at all despite completing the course successfully out of my own hard work .
negative	i did that and i was contacted by the manager of derby optical_express to go down and have my eyes_tested to find out why i get headache .
neutral	i have my doubts that they were despatched in the first place , was on the point of reporting to barclaycard when the arrived .
positive	will definitely use again .
neutral	prices take the proverbial and often full of kids
negative	i used to use 00 for years , i got out this year and moved to another carrier .
negative	!
positive	i saw the set i wanted which had 00_%_discount then was surprised to find that there was a further 00 %.
negative	goodbye lovefilm , hello netflix .

neutral	however , the tank was not quite full - perhaps 00_euros below full .
negative	they just offered to email on my behalf .
neutral	the seat_belt is very stiff to open and close hopefully with time it will become easier to open and close the seat_belt .
positive	very happy , will be ordering again .
neutral	0 / 0_days_later i then received an_email_saying that my ordered item was out of stock and would be despatched the following week .
negative	they stole our money .
negative	i buy online regularly but have never been compelled to leave a review until now .
neutral	but the prices and range i think are good .

positive	very happy with the service .
positive	the cooker was delivered promptly and professionally .
neutral	if i ' d have been better informed when i choose £ 0 next_day delivery that i wouldn_'_t actually receive it for two_days , i ' d obviously not have chosen to waste £ 0 & just simply waited on normal delivery .
negative	my boss ' phone eventually arrived this morning , opened and used .
negative	because of this i requested a cancellation which could not be processed 00_minutes after i ordered .
negative	i will never use british_gas for anything again .
negative	i spoke to stephen greenman and he personally assured me that he would deal with this and call me back , but nothing has happened with that .

neutral	they felt so nice to begin with but just after one wash they dont feel new anymore
negative	i ordered a steam_mop through kgb , when the mop never arrived , i wrote to kgb numerous_emails asking for a refund , they did not even answer . if you want to use these sites stick to groupon , i had a similar problem with one of their deals and they refunded me without_any_problems ! i have now referred the case to my credit_card provider .
neutral	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
positive	we chose key_retirement_solutions because of the number of awards won by the company , and because which magazine voted them the best equity_release company .
neutral	acceptable but not quite as_described and shown in picture .
negative	what if i had paid full price !!
neutral	goods were as ordered although each can ( 0 in all ) were all damaged in all fairness this could of been the courier although there was only packing_material in the bottom of the box , no packing between each item .

positive	first_class service , excellent prices and next_day delivery .
neutral	freebies that come with spending over a specified amount are good and bad .
negative	took an_absolute age to deliver ( about 0 months ).
negative	so i waited thirty - six minutes for them to answer the phone .
neutral	our arrival at the port , parking , checking in , boarding were all good experiences with friendly helpful staff .
positive	confirmation was swift and so was delivery .
positive	helpful & friendly
positive	reasonable delivery speed too .

negative	0pm delivery promised - £ 0 . 00 paid + £_00 for flowers .
positive	i contacted pedalon by email to find out that i had to order 0 spoke because of the postal_costs .
neutral	i found the website easy to use and is very well set_up for its need .
negative	if you have struggled to get a replacement / refund in the first six_months of purchase , it would be interesting to know how cpw dealt_with the fault .
positive	bus collects you outside airport ( on ground_floor ) and leaves you at hotel entrance .
positive	did an on line search and quoteme0 were coming out the best price , i asked for various different quotes from them and all was dealt_with incredibly efficiently and they answered all my questions very thoroughly .
neutral	i bought a couple of gorgeous baby hats , which were stupidly expensive but so sweet i couldn_'_t_resist .

positive	awesome and easy , literally print a label off attach it to my parcel pop over the road to the shop they scan it job_done .
negative	as a first_utility customer for several_years i had looked at the negative_reviews with scepticism as the online switch and monthly reading part of the transaction was actually pretty easy .
positive	i recently_bought some cupboard handles for a bedroom project i '_m doing and i was very impressed with the quality and finish of their handles .
neutral	the items seems to be of a good quality .
neutral	free polish and some zen advice on furniture arrangement might have crept my review to 0 / 0_stars , but is good service not just the standard ?
negative	never again will i use this company they could have helped_me by ensuring my order was dispatched quickly with all the contact i have made but they just didn_'_t care !!!
neutral	i ordered at lunchtime so really feel this was wrong , they did however offer me to cancel my order and get a full_refund , which i did not do as i needed the bits i ordered .
neutral	i applied to recycle my phone twice but i didn_'_t get a jiffy_bag in the post ( as mentioned on the website ) either time .
negative	to be honest i was really disappointed with them and my mother even commented on them which made me very embarrassed !
negative	i will let you make you own mind up whether to order from this company at your_own_risk !
neutral	batteries provided : 0

negative	so .
neutral	love your sight and tiles but too expensive to use all the time because of delivery .
negative	all other couriers have delivered correctly !
neutral	although the other products were not spoiled just the packaging ( they were gifts for other people ] i emailed the said company who responded by telling_me to return the goods and they will resend unfortunately for me the gifts were needed imminently so i wont_be sending them back what i will be doing is choosing a different company to use .
negative	avoid if you don_'_t want to be disappointed because i '_m disappointed in every transaction i make
positive	if they were able to expand the range of both long and short_sleeve jerseys , i doubt i ’ d bother looking anywhere_else .
negative	three emails claimed that goods had been sent when they had not been .
positive	from ordering online on a wednesday , it arrived by the saturday !
negative	i would never fly with them again and i would strongly_recommend avoiding this airline at all costs .
negative	like other_reviewers the booking process could have only taken 0 minutes and budget_air are more than happy to take your money !
positive	very helpful advice over the phone .
negative	i obviously complained via_e_- mail to eflorist attaching a photo of the tiny bunch of mixed blooms and received a standard reply_stating that the customer_services team would get back to me after some 00_hours or up to 00_hours during busy_periods i . e mothers_day etc .

positive	yet as effective as absinthe .
positive	i was impressed by the fast friendly service that mr centralheating delivered !
negative	they keep telling us that when the items arrive we will be very happy .

positive	on the day , i received an email_stating the hour_slot it would be delivered in and true to their word , they were there 00_minutes into that hour .
positive	clear website and product description .

negative	i eventually rang the director steve marshall and he was very rude .
negative	the banks response ?
neutral	a cancellation recently occurred and i was gutted again .
neutral	face to face discussions are far easier to handle than telephone_conversations . when i did get the paperwork it was quite difficult to understand and after_reading through it i did not think that it had been explained to me in sufficient detail . as stated previously i am satisfied with the outcome but i just hope that harrington_brooks staff remember that they are communicating with a real_person not just a phone number
negative	awful company and would agree they are con men , even if it '_s the cheapest or you can '_t get what yolu want anywhere_else i would avoid them like the plague or put your money in the fire it '_s the same thing .

positive	viovet is a godsend to me , with 00 cats i need both subscription and non subscription items from a reliable , trustworthy and fair price source - thats viovet .
neutral	i was actually happy with the price quoted for 0 dunlop_tyres only to be left with a sour_taste after clicking the accept customer survey button after making my purchase .

neutral	appartamento spazioso , ben arrredato e riscaldato .
positive	i needed a new laptop as the one i had wasn_'_t good enough for what i needed .
neutral	have contacted twice about this issue and was told first time ( thursday ) to ring back next week and second time ( tuesday of next week ) that someone would look into it and ring me back , they haven_'_t .

negative	as it turns_out the package did turn_up , but at 0pm after waiting in all day .
positive	would definitely use again .
negative	i don_'_t know where to begin . non - existent customer service , items not collected , misinformation ( aka " lies "), fraudulent signing for delivery of items , items disappearing whilst in their ' care ' ( i use that word ironically ), items left out in full public view to be nicked , items nicked by couriers , items deliberately damaged by operatives , massive delays , no response to e_-_mails , being kept hanging for ages on a 00p - a - minute phone line . need i go on ?!

neutral	after ordering some flowers over the internet realised i needed to change some details .
positive	great choice of designs , fast delivery , excellent discount , easy to use site .
negative	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn_'_t honour the delivery ?
positive	the selection overall is not as good for parts as it is for clothing , luggage and other general accessories .
neutral	got a groupon deal , but could have got a bettter deal by internet_search .
neutral	why does it take so long to get to the payable stage , i purchased home insurance in november 00 and it still has not been cleared for payment

neutral	good service in the end .
neutral	i took it back to the store only to be told i had to return on line or take a credit_note . as none of superdry_jackets / coats fit me i didnt want to take a credit_note so my only option was to bag it up in its original package ( with lots of cello tape ) seek out the label again and find out where i could send it back to !!
neutral	asked for a new delivery plus some chocolates added .
negative	i would add , again , everyone i spoke to was courteous but clearly they are tied by how much they were able to help satisfy a customer and take decisions !
positive	telling all my friends about this fab company .
negative	chased by email , no reply , chased again .

positive	if you want top service , best price and a guaranteed ( really guaranteed not just an empty boast ) delivery then choose this great company .

negative	still fighting for a refund !
positive	the best of the best , great dryer , great service .
negative	to say all of this fiasco and accusations has vexed me would be an_understatement .
neutral	make_sure you read the small_print , when they say you can change your site as you see fit they only mean the word content .
neutral	on complaining this was reduced to £_00 . 00 .
neutral	as an artist , i am constantly attempting to make the images larger , only to be told they are still not " good quality ".

negative	then they were to fix it on 00 / 00 /_0000 .

positive	the delivery service is excellent and i have been pleased to find everything i have ordered as_described and good quality .
neutral	this was very annoying as i '_d already said i would pay 0 delivery charges .
neutral	if this review is read by mangement i would expect a reply and reason_why the service was less_than satisfactory - not just a feedback saying you apologise that we had to defer our travel for at_least 00_minutes and did not opbtain the car requested
neutral	by the time we got to desk , they had to upgraded us from ka to focus , as had run out of cars .
neutral	no worse no better_than any other such organisation .
negative	i will report them as everyone else did .
neutral	also everything you pay for - cocktail , dinner , sausage roll , whatever - if you pay by card you '_ll get asked every time to add a gratuity .
neutral	customer service is bend_over_backwards to help , and finally resolved the stock problem and then the delivery problem , however they need to sort_out the phone waiting times , i was on numerous_times over an_hour , hence the £_00 on phone_calls and they refused to phone me back .
positive	this is my 0nd purchase from 0000rpm , i cant_fault there service its excellent .
neutral	nice email from the company but things i have ordered from other people generally arrive within a couple of days - so what happened here ?
negative	that was my experience during half_term at taunton asda .

neutral	it was not the best bouquet i had ever_seen .
negative	that was option 0 on their list , so thought i ' d try option 0 their sales line . nope , silly me , after trying several_times on every available option & constantly getting cut_off . i slowly started to panic , i ' d paid this company i '_ve never_heard of before a few_hundred_quid of my hard_earned_cash & now i could_find anyone who cared enough to answer the telephone .

positive	it '_s nice to get a response from a genuine company providing a good service .
neutral	the tens machine is good , although it takes a while to get used to the feelings it generates .
neutral	i like facebook as a social_network , not much good if you want a private conversation though !!
neutral	had i been advised of the delivery problems i would have looked elsewhere
negative	i immediately phoned a florist in the nearest_town , 00 miles_away , to arrange a delivery - which of course , due to eflorist '_s inability to get back to me would now be very late for the anniversary .
positive	however they kept their promises by delivering quickily .
negative	i was told that the flowers are with the courier company and have been since saturday 00th .
positive	product delivered and assembled .
negative	i '_m awaiting payment to my account from chess_telecom .
positive	so i would definitely recommend this company to a friend .

neutral	won_'_t use again !
neutral	i didn_'_t order an on switch either but it came with one anyway .
neutral	most companies also don_'_t pay within any less_than approximately 0_months , some up to 0 .

neutral	talk_talk much_cheaper . and better customer service too .
neutral	flowers were nice but my card and message were not included , which was a shame as i had written a special poem for the recipient .
positive	the 0 pair of ear_rings i purchased arrived on time and the 0 boxes as well as the draw string bags was a very nice_touch as was the picture of who packed the items , this company packages it '_s self very well .
positive	i would use travelex again .
neutral	hi recently bought two ink_cartridges ( 0 black and 0 tri - colour for my hp officejet 0000 , which were delivered promptly , however , whilst the black one was fine , the colour one did not fit , when i compared it to the one i had taken out , there was a difference in the shape , the message on my printer kept telling_me it was incorrect .

negative	they do not reply to any emails you send and just take your money !!
positive	bedworld in my opinion has an_extensive_range of beds to choose from .

neutral	got to leeds /_bradford long_stay in good time ( 0 - 0 hours prior to flight ) having already booked parking .

positive	it is easy to navigate each page from the homepage / guest - house pages / map layouts etc_etc with clear headers for guidance , in all instances i can remember it was comparatively the cheapest and also not only is the depth of information about each guest - house detailed but also local information is readily_available - and this is almost always reliable as it is not only ratified by yourselves at hostelbookers but by other_travellers who have reviewed , commented and posted about various aspects .

positive	they did a very good job .
neutral	the villa was large the grounds and pool very impressive however on entering it was cold damp and fusty with no apparent means of heatig the second week did improve after doors , shutters and windows were left opened .

positive	i purchased a sony a000 and am delighted with the product and the price .
neutral	i like the service and price of collect_+ but the only thing that let '_s then down is the fools working in my local_garage who seem like they don_'_t like taking these packages and make it as difficult as possible when they do take them , complaining_about size even_though the size of my parcels are well within the stated maximum yet they try and put you off sending it by saying the driver won_'_t take it etc .

neutral	this is not eco friendly and is also inconvenient .

neutral	the goldcar check in and collection is in the same place , unlike_other rental_companies there , meaning the car_park is busy and chaotic , and the collection queue is long and slow ( i was there for at_least 00_minutes ).
neutral	the show we saw ( barking in essex ) wasn_'_t what we were expecting and not really that funny just full of swearing with a weak story line and some famous names in it .

positive	good stuff wd !
positive	traditional_estate_agents can sell your house and make the whole_process fancy but still just as painful , so save_yourself some money and only pay for what you need - online exposure , for sale sign and an office to handle to correspondance .
negative	we ordered a small shed from internet_gardener last_week .
negative	i called the customer service said i wanted to return the product , first they said they wont accept as i had opened the cellophane packaging and when i mentioned fake and its not similar to the one i have then they said ok send it with a letter stating the reason for you return .

positive	it was very competitively_priced parking for our 0 day stay .
neutral	unfortunately , they arrived in completely random order , making it necessary to spend a lot of time going through more than 000 computer images to get them back into date / time order - important for a holiday record for example .
negative	the driver tried to telephone the store but couldn ’_t get through .
positive	free delivery is fantastic and the shoes were delivered only two_days after ordering at the weekend .

negative	they also didn_'_t confirm my refund until i emailed them twice .
positive	prompt service and a range of interesting puzzles .
positive	really fast accurate service - good quality goods
negative	i do consider that the delivery team were aware of this by the way the left the damaged side away from view at the end of the kitchen , the speed that they asked me to sign the form and the fact that they would not return when called on their mobile ( literally just left ).
positive	i have already , the friend being a carpenter .

positive	good service too .
positive	like this site for finding good deals .
positive	the website is easy to use .
neutral	the passage from average to very good is too wide and as a matter of fact quite a few of my reviews although i rate them as 0_stars , i always mention in the actual review that the reader should read it as 0 and a half .
neutral	in fact , it exceeded the limit on my card , and i was forced to buy the full insurance for an extra 00 euro , making the rental no_longer a deal .
neutral	i was just disappointed with the amount of flowers as it looked like a lot more in the picture so i will be going elsewhere in future .
neutral	would probably think_twice about buying from you again because of this .
negative	i checked my account and saw that it was " released for delivery ".
negative	reading
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending them and am about to order another banner from them .

neutral	this time however wasn_'_t .
positive	ordered on sunday , received tuesday .
positive	i feel like my life is completely changed , being_able to wake_up and see the clock was a bit of a shock quite honestly but gradually i have become used to it and now dont have to worry_about having everything with me if i go_anywhere or suffer the pain of dust on my lens causing watery eyes for hours .
positive	had it not been for maxine , i would be complaining_about company but she sorted everything out really quickly and was charming .
positive	i first read abut the company '_s deals on the hotukdeals site and boy are they amazing !

positive	not all of us are good on the internet .
neutral	three promises to phone back and stiil no contact .
negative	if you can '_t dispatch the correct item for whatever_reason , a quick curteous email to the customer explaining this , perhaps with a small apology would go a long way !
neutral	flowers didn_'_t arrive_till about 0pm when it was dark and they were left in a wheely bin !
neutral	it was time wasting and embarrassing especially as i knew that i was correct .
negative	they didn_’_t care .

negative	so on day 00 of holding the policy we contacted the warranty shop to start a claim and that '_s when the fun started .

negative	company should accept_responsibility for their incompentence .

positive	good very good
positive	i have an odd prescription but they phoned to check it was right and were able to adjust the lense thickness of one eye accordingly .

positive	very good quality .
positive	i was firstly very gratified to find that the spare_part that i was looking for featured in your extremely compehensive range of products and secondly , i was particularly_impressed by the speed at which it was delivered - it was refreshing to find that " guaranteed next_day delivery " meant what it said on the tin .

neutral	i mean , why did i receive an email at 0000hours on saturday stating that they had " been delivered " and then receive a phone_call from the delivery driver at 0000hours asking me where the property was ???

positive	great company and super_fast delivery superb
negative	order placed 0st_november_0000 ; a delivery time of 0_months was given which we felt was a long time but the furniture was just what we had been looking for so we decided we could be patient a little_longer ; after 0_months , we received an_email from ofl saying they had tried to phone us – a stupid lie when our phone displays missed calls and has an answer phone facility ; i called ofl , who advised me of a delay of about a month – no reason given .

positive	thank_you very much .
neutral	very sloppy .
negative	sincerely ,
neutral	sometimes it works but most of the time you need to have your booking email handy as the barrier doesn_'_t open or it asks for full payment .
neutral	the only nuisance is i got one done for reading and the other eye corrected for long_distance , the eye for distance heeled quickly , but 0_months later i am still travelling once a month to my nearest optical , express which is 00_minutes drive_away as the eye for reading keeps changing and i will probably need to go back and get an enhancement in that eye .

negative	i wrote to alpharooms , but they do not take the responsibility and no compensation is possible .
neutral	i found a phone number but this was no_longer in operation and i then found out that they no_longer have a phone service .
negative	basically they are taking customers money in good faith saying they have adequate stock_levels but in reality they are building up a back log of orders so that they can purchase the phones when they have say 0000 orders at rock_bottom prices .
negative	oh and when i try to call their uk number , nobody_answers so i can only communicate via a form on their website !
neutral	please keep the package as small as possible so that it has a chance of going through a letter_box .
negative	i also explained that i needed some kind of confirmed timescale as there was no one at his home and i would have to arrange family to be there to accept delivery .
negative	so i waited .
neutral	car itself was fine .
neutral	i therefore ordered it by phone from a third firm , mojo spares ltd , who did everything it said on the tin .
negative	the quality was extremely bad and the £ 0 postage for something that was sent 0nd_class in an envelope was ridicolous .
negative	i purchased a product which did turned_out did not come with all the essential parts , when i contacted the company about it they were aware that it wasn_'_t supplied and also were able to say it wasn_'_t possible to get it .
negative	presumably whoever was packaging my items dropped it in the box .
neutral	i purchased a voucher through amazon for a canvas including postage . going through the process to pay it didnt allow me to use the vocher code so i had to pay full price with my credit_card .

negative	i have received no useful responses from the customer service team after i notified them ( not the other way around !)
negative	if not , your set_up is amateurish .
neutral	found the prices on the ship really over the top , even the shops were pricing there goods far to high . had dinner going and coming_back what we got was good enough but travelling with a chief even he thought the pricing was way of the mark .
neutral	then i get a call on a saturday_morning before the pre booked monday delivery to tell me that the tiles were not in stock and ' if ' they were available at the suppliers then i would get them delivered on wednesday at the earliest , i had to tell my customer the bad_news , i was accused by my customer of planning the later delivery to ' buy ' time .

positive	easy to order delivery as promised would use the site again passed with flying_colours .
negative	i would definitely recommend the jalalabad !
negative	it '_s not worth it , go with a reputable_company .
neutral	they charge for 00 hour periods so if your flight time is such that you are away for 00_hours you get to pay another tenner for the extra hour .
positive	after having an awful time with the last lot of lounge_furniture from a big 0 % interest furniture store who seem to have permanent sales going on , i am thrilled to find a uk manufacturer who_knows_how to look after their customers and supply very reasonably_priced , good - looking and comfortable furniture .

neutral	the item was very quick at being delivered very impressed .
neutral	i have used achica a number of times so they can '_t he that bad but having had numerous unfulfilled orders i won_'_t depend_on them so i '_d never buy birthday_presents from them .

neutral	i use a number of online meat suppliers and this was by far the worse .
positive	used hostelworld several_times over the last 0 years and found to be reliable , easy to use .
neutral	when we did get going the bus was excellent .
neutral	beware woolworths stringent and onerous privacy rules regarding marketing which require a written letter sent in the post using very specific wording to unsubscribe separately from telemarketing , direct mail and emails even if you didn_'_t agree to marketing in the first place !

negative	nothing turned_up after 0_weeks so i emailed them .
positive	cant_fault them .
positive	the spd lugs seem genuine and great value even in comparison prices on ebay .
neutral	0 for price but because they sent wrong_colour boxes they get demoted to a 0 !
negative	and i have since discovered that they have over charged me over 000_pound !!
neutral	back in the old days they were throwing cheque books at me , and giving an unnecessarily high credit_limit .
negative	good customer service is not shown when everything goes smooth .
positive	yes , would totally recommend and now know where to go to first when seeking a similar product .
neutral	this is flawed beyond_belief .
neutral	it took extra time and it was rather stressful .
negative	do not order from them !
negative	they just think they are big enough to treat badley their existing_customers .
negative	so i am left , after nearly 0_weeks , with no product , no idea when ( or even if ) i will get it , and no response from the company to my request for a refund .
negative	i am used to buy on line and i never ever had any problem until i found smartbuyglasses uk .
neutral	so in future i will probably look_elsewhere when looking for my supplies .
positive	the osmo wash and care was brilliant , cleaned and brightened my floor in no time .
neutral	would have had a better rating if the flowers had been delivered correctly .
positive	soak and sleep does it again .
negative	this mistake ended_up costing me £ 000in addition wages and was surprised that they would only refund delivery charge when i complained .
neutral	as this is my first order not particularly impressed at the moment !
positive	the recipient emailed to say parcel had arrived_safely .
positive	its a pleasure .
negative	what '_s the point of independent and honest review if it '_s censored .?

neutral	item was out of stock but was not e_mailed
positive	i recently_purchased glasses from glasses0you and found they were not
positive	it was a really friendly web_site - allowing you view your sign before purchase .
negative	i am_hopeful that during this summer we might see some real progress ( i '_m holding my breath ).
positive	i found the prices a couple of pounds better_than the other advertising companies on each phone i sent in .
neutral	at these prices you can travel to other venues with greater ticket availability and pay the same .
negative	never again will never use viagogo and will make_sure this review is on every website possible .
positive	would recommend to anyone
negative	the flowers arrived and i was absolutely horrified at the state of them .
neutral	but when i phoned the company to say i am returning the product the lady on the phone was very nice and polite .

positive	will_definately keep you on my short list .
neutral	poor quality , will not use again ,
positive	very good service always .
neutral	great prices .
neutral	it is absolutely_appalling that i had to stay in for 0 whole days to get this parcel delivered .
positive	however , when i looked at it more closely , the rate they were giving me was terrible .
neutral	fast delivery but i thought the product was a bit over priced .
neutral	please always place customer phone number over the package if that is home delivery !!
neutral	i also feel that the voucher you give as a thank_you should not be valid for such a short time .
negative	they left a package containing a £_000 coat in a wet cardboard package at the back door at christmas time
negative	i could have done it myself on the ryan_air website
negative	the case is too small and the lid cannot closed and it may band the glasses !!
negative	it then appeared to be working but nearly 0 years after buying it , the watch stopped completely .
negative	background : o0 had agreed to replace a faulty iphone for me and i was told i needed to swap it with the driver who would call within the next two_days .
negative	not on saturdays . then you are supposed to wait the whole day for the delivery !!
negative	only 0 out of ghe 0 items ordered have arrived .
neutral	i have when been a customer of t - mobile been unfortunate to have received poor coverage on my mobile , however with the recent merging of signals with orange then this could really improve their total coverage throughout the uk >

positive	will use against

positive	paul
positive	great service , items were delivered in a timely_fashion & for free , order was correct and i received plenty of email_notifications to keep me in the loop .

neutral	small_print is too small i miss read been back on the site non left !!!!
positive	the furniture we ordered was exactly as expected and looks great in our lounge .
negative	the flowers were sent by my sister and me in appreciation of the kindness to her of my late mother '_s neighbours .
positive	i have tried this company to let my flat in ayr , and find the service excellent value for money .
negative	rude staff calling in a daily_basis .
negative	this meant that the package was received and dealt_with by parcelforce and not delivered by royal_mail ( all of the items i '_ve purchased from china arrive through royal_mail .)
neutral	i ordered the lenses online which was easy and straightforward even better that i could use my paypal_account .
negative	very poor service from plumbworld - i waited in for a day , it didn_'_t arrive and no contact was made .
neutral	bought a small variety of items of which i have tried the crisps - not too bad but nothing special and wensleydale cheese which had a bitter aftertaste .
negative	the product arrived a day after the event .!
positive	they dispatched it quickly and they had the best price for the product after doing lots of shopping around they were also one of very few companies offering free_postage on it !
neutral	in return , i got not a brand_new guitar but a shop_soiled one sold as brand_new .
positive	i contacted alpharooms and they contacted the company on my behalf , this saved me wasting my time and money on phone_calls so i could carry on having a relaxing_holiday .
neutral	it matters not if your flight has_been delayed , they ' re gone !!
positive	will be visiting this retailer again .
negative	con men send you through with order then once they '_ve got ya bank details take 000 . 00 pounds off you without telling you first
positive	i made a mistake on original order , so phoned them up .
positive	i went forthe trial_frames initially to find the style that suited me .
neutral	although the flowers were in good condition they didn_'_t quite have the same wow_factor as the picture i saw on the website of the large bouquet .
neutral	nice concept .
negative	i am now trying to find out the contact details for the managing_director as i feel this is an appalling way to treat a regular customer !
negative	nothing arrived by the deadline .
positive	the person i spoke to was friendly , well informed and efficient .
positive	i ordered everything i would need for my son '_s engagement party .
negative	in the end they said they would arrange for us all to stay in the hotel but due to all the problems we had already had we all agreed it would be less hassle for us to cancel and for my sister to pay everyone else the money back .
negative	i was told as it was sent second class i should give it another week before i email them again .
neutral	there was no obvious way to secure a pick_up or hire car which is normally offered at the main_dealer .
neutral	a hair_dryer would have been welcome , and less noise from neighbouring flats over the way across the car - park .
positive	quick response to orders , goods well_packaged .
neutral	hi , all went well until i printed details out at the end .
negative	you will see it once it hit the account !!
neutral	fortunately the hotel was able to rectify the problem immediately and the stay was superb .
positive	ordering records easy , a few_clicks and your order is at home .
neutral	not interparcels fault exactly but still a bit off that citi link try & pull the wool over your eyes and your just expected to live with it - people usually book a service and pay more for it for a reason .
positive	i would definitely order from them again .
negative	my ' next_day delivery ' order still has not arrived ( 0 week_later ).
negative	no other packets get lost nor take longer_than 0 week to arrive here . i dont live in mongolia . only southern_spain .
positive	the gear i ordered was delivered very promptly , the confirmation via e_- mail from the carrier ( ups ) was great ` cos i had the order delivered to a different address from home . it was most reassuring - they even told me who signed for it .
positive	of all the wedding flower suppliers i considered ( real and silk ), silk_blooms offered the best range and creativity with prices in line with or better_than most other_places so i gave them a call .
negative	surprise_surprise .
neutral	hand book omitted from pack handed to me .
positive	a very pleasant lorry_driver placed the pallet two steps from my front_door which made it easy to take inside .
negative	i will have to hope paypal can get me a refund as i don_'_t think gamekeys0u . net care at all .
positive	and thank_you for being so nice in resolving confusion_over my order duplication .
neutral	product spoilt by more than a few misshapen items .
negative	are appliancesonline '_s cashflow problems really that bad ?
neutral	farnell - if you read this , think again .

negative	i have contacted bbc '_s watchdog via their website , advise you do also .
positive	sure_enough , the mail order service is every bit as impressive as their in - store service .
positive	i sat back and waited .
neutral	i know that another ferry company will not charge in the first 00_hours so i was quite disappointed with the service as i had spent £_000 on a single way ticket which is not cheap .
positive	i saw the tv_advert , had an old moby to sell , mazuma did just as they said they would and now i have money for something that would have ended_up being thrown in the bin .
neutral	an email to confirm that you had my phone would have gone a long way .
positive	ordering was easy and i was kept_informed of progress including when they were delivered .
negative	their website says 00_% of orders despatched within 0_days .
negative	however it seems to take this company several days to reply to emails and a courier tried to deliver a second mixer which i refused to accept .
neutral	i have then received payment 0_days_later but got a phone same day explaining still wasnt impressed with thecwait .
positive	the service from beginning to end has_been flawless and a pleasure .
positive	as a tutor , i have found firsttutors to be a thoroughly professional company .
positive	ive told everyone i know about ao couldn_'_t_believe_how reasonable my washing_machine was and it was here the next_day
negative	it has cost me money in arranging an extra visit from the plumber plus all the hassle . one week on from delivery still no replacement parts , rubbish service never again , please compensate me .
negative	this is a " false spoken statement damaging to our reputation ". i have sent report after report , suggestion after suggestion called the facebook no service customer service phone number only to go round in circles and told at the end they do not offer phone support !
negative	i ordered items never recieved them .
positive	ordered at ashort notice but they arrived in perfect time and she was delighted .
neutral	later in the day she rang to advise me it was missing as she had not managed to locate it .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled , laura_ashley is a company that has appalling customer service .

neutral	!
positive	will buy again from sputnik without_fail !
positive	i have now bought 0 pairs of fitflops on line from shoetique .
neutral	although i had to send the frames back twice as i could not see properly through them ( i suspect that the lenses were put in the wrong way around ), when they eventually arrived back corrected , i was so pleased with the glasses overall and i love the new frames i have that are very different to my old pair .
negative	bt are a disgraceful hopelessly dysfunctional organisation .
neutral	they do have some good writers , but they ' re just not given enough free will .
positive	the price was very competitive and having placed my order i was impressed with the speed of delivery .
neutral	recently made a purchase and everything was of good standard until the carrier took over - city_link - and delivered my parcel to another house over 0 / 0 mile_away .
negative	they ended_up pretty_much ruining two holidays , don_'_t make the same mistake we did !
positive	very occasionally sites don_'_t pay but they do look into it if you can be bothered to chase_up .
neutral	£ 0 was knocked_off my payment because of a tiny_scratch on the screen . its as though it wouldn_'_t have been expected being a used phone !
negative	recently_purchased a pair of north_face tent mules which were unfortunately the wrong_size . i paid the £ 0 to return them and asked for a pair which their website showed were in stock . some 00 days_later i received a message_saying i have had a refund , no contact from the company offering me any alternative which the website is still showing they have stock of . so at the end of the day i have paid out £ 0 in postage which is not refunded and have no tent mules , which i am sure they still have in stock , no communication , nothing . poor .
neutral	all that being said , the fitter rang 00_mins before arriving to say he was on his way and then completed the job ( fitting two new tyres ) speedily and with no_fuss .
negative	why do they waste so much money ?
negative	i never received the call after waiting by the phone all day and sending a chaser email /
neutral	i ordered some perfume for my sister '_s birthday .
negative	i am_disgusted with the way i have been treated and still have no wardrobe and no compensation !
positive	thoroughly recommendable .
neutral	unfortunately , the vehicle was not available at the pick - up location and we had to take a cab with all our_luggage to the airport depot and then wait in a queue for an_hour before being_processed .
positive	and if thers a problem they sort it with no_hastle
neutral	it should have cost 0 pounds max .
negative	queries to the online waterstone '_s message board have , through the online intermediary , revealed that they have no_intention of continuing the conversation .
positive	they are quick , friendly and always deliver .
negative	ofl seemed clueless about the progress of delivery and appeared chaotic in their administration and communication .
negative	signed_up in june_0000 , service worked for one month then technical_issues started , tech_support very poor .
negative	instead you '_ll be out of pocket once you '_ve made your refund .
negative	** slightly_lower prices than other energy_suppliers but unprofessional calls and strange and aggressive voicemails left when a bill was paid one day late for example **
neutral	did ' nt purchase pass went outside asked a local police officer and he did ' nt mince his words , he advised they were trying to rip us off !!
neutral	getting a bit fed_up of that , oh marketing departments .
negative	i have given this company time to respond and rectify this problem , but they have not .
negative	the shame is that the mattress seemed good quality and had i had confidence in company and delivery systems i would have paid for and kept the mattress .
negative	firstly they didn_'_t confirm the order by email which is usually customary with good companies .
positive	good website easy to view & purchase was easy experience .
positive	delighted with product and service
neutral	i cant_fault the service given by mega_fancy_dress , they dispatched the items very quickly .
positive	i would not_hesitate to buy from this company again .
positive	no problem as my husband was already on his way there .
negative	there was no message_telling_me that the curtains i had ordered were out of stock .
positive	i looked on the internet , and identified cv_lizard .
neutral	stephanie failed to reply .
neutral	whilst the searching for a part and ordering were easy the information_regarding delivery was less_than satisfactory .

neutral	i ordered a bed for next_day delivery , but it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	returned it for super_fast refund of full_amount & both postages .

positive	excellent service and love the tin signs we got .
positive	thank_you .
neutral	on a plus note the outside of the villa was beautiful and well_maintained , and the views were lovely .
neutral	it seems to me that stephanie has completely missed the point .

positive	the order was easy to place and the follow_up contact was good .
neutral	picked_up the car at dinard airport , had to queue for over an_hour before i got to the desk , but wen i did , the service was good , the problem was that there was only one member of staff on duty , and it took about 00_minutes for each customer .
neutral	buying a domain is an_absolute_bargain .
neutral	they managed to get our address wrong , contact name wrong and email address wrong even_though i placed the order on line , i emailed them regarding an account quire as no one on the phone could help me so i was asked to email accounts , its been 0_days and still no reply from accounts , i was told items would be with me with in 0 - 0 working_days , two_weeks_later still had not received items i had to chase them , still have items outstanding even_though i was told they would all be here at the same time , although the price of the items are very good , i find their customer service not on top form .
negative	i rang two_days ago and item should of at_least been dispatched now
negative	obviously concerned i called the next_day and again after approx 00 calls i eventually spoke to a girl who said that we would be picked_up at 0000 hours the following_morning ( 0 hours before our flight and some 00_minutes from the airport ! )

positive	i would recommend them to anyone :-)
neutral	emailed ecco .
positive	very pleased with items that i bought to replace some duff items that id returned to toolstation .
positive	and no p_&_p !
positive	in comparison to virgin medias book which had far too much information which was off putting hence my decision to use talk_talk as my provider
neutral	even_though i have had a bad_experience i would still have another try and order from the site again leaving plenty of time to return the goods if_necessary !
neutral	the results were great but the experience was horrible .
neutral	i ordered a pair of half glasses using a promotion_code to 0 for one .

positive	i have recommended mazumamobile to all my family and friends : )
negative	they don_'_t care about their customers and the fact that i am £_000 out of pocket and they '_ve had my money for nearly a month .
positive	thank_you !
negative	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number ).
positive	but , although the courier service kept us waiting for longer_than we had hoped , the contact with justtvstands made us feel very comfortable that it would arrive .
neutral	en revanche , j ' ai payé un supplément pour être livrée à domicile et là , le drame , je_suis livrée dans_un point relai , pas franchement à proximité avec un bonus de style ( colis à retirer sous 0_jours ).
neutral	finally , she was initially reluctant to call our nanny / housekeeper - she initially asked if i would do it - and then she acquiesed at my ' insistence '.
negative	what does kwik means anyway ?
positive	most satisfactory .
neutral	really impressed with the customer service and the design and layout of the plan .
neutral	this can then be a long_drawn_out process for little reward .
negative	we bought a wowcher deal for a weeks accommodation in tenerife , we paid in full & then booked the dates we would be staying .
negative	a letter to thomas_cook later - they weren_'_t in the slightest bit interested .
neutral	my uncle then had to call the company to ask you had sent the parcel_ i suppose 0 more puzzle than_expected , but suggest the on line facility enables gift messages in future .
neutral	we asked for a 0k loan a few_years back - and they just didn_'_t respond to the request at all !

positive	ordered 0 new tyres online
negative	there prices on thier website are not real .

positive	all their hostel i used to visit are great ( good rating standard )
negative	then it would be either friday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) or monday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
neutral	so i am not sure i have actually tasted the coffee properly , as i am not convinced that even on the second or third attempts the capsules were properly pierced through .
positive	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
positive	thank_you .
negative	had to help him upstairs ( not easy for woman in her 00s ).
positive	i have made several orders from physique for a range of products from foam rollers to books and massage creams , and have found the website easy to navigate and their delivery service extremely efficient and reliable .
neutral	as it was the more_expensive choice that i made so i thought i could at_least expect a more_expensive finish .
negative	habe kundenservice angeschrieben und online eine beschwerde gemeldet .

negative	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
neutral	the plants i ordered were well_packed and have grown on well .
negative	considering the cost of the units there are equal quality at a much_better price available , very expensive mistake all in all
neutral	next time , i think i will send it to htc directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when i explained it to them .
positive	it '_ll help me save up for my laser_eye_surgery and finally be rid of glasses altogether !
neutral	so_far .
negative	if you are in the supermarket and the till breaks , once they fix it they dont send you to the back of the queue , you serve them as soon as possible .
positive	great service , item received so well_packaged and secure .
neutral	it had not been sent to me because the manufacturers stopped printing it .
negative	i text my boyfriend who was in shock and promptly rang mattressman explaining that again was not as planned and that i was made late for work in recieveing the bed .

positive	by_chance a friend had transported a lawnmower from the midlands to cornwall using anyvan and suggested we used it .
neutral	waterproof but uses batteries too quickly in auto mode
neutral	when stood next to each other you could easilly see the size difference .
negative	they also try to sell by finding an over_inflated guide price , of recent this has_been for android tablets , the price they make an example of is way over the real selling price , trying to fool you into thinking you can buy and then sell on and make something .
negative	that didn_'_t happen .
neutral	this was at edinburgh , therefore this ment i handed the car back without a full_tank of fuel .
negative	now that is the biggest wind up i have ever had .
positive	please do try this company it is great , my birds_love what i get them , it is always good ,
neutral	!
negative	i look at their web_page and strangely_enough they are on a fourth_floor in a building in london .
neutral	i then visited the site and found loads of vouchers which i could have used - it may explain_why this site is more_expensive than some others .
positive	quick from ordering to delivery .
positive	!
positive	0nd time i have used mazuma .
neutral	0 .
positive	0 shelves arrived damaged but a call to a helpful customer_services department resulted_in replacements arriving the next_day .
neutral	the order arrived in a very strong box , however more packing tape could be used to seal the box , especially with fresh_meat inside , the single length of tape across the boxes length was nowhere strong_enough to hold the boxes weight and the 0 main flaps had seperated and the box was partially open , the box contents was still cold though .
positive	as for the pc everything i had asked for was present and working like a dream , good quality parts , and the pc is a beast and destroys anything i throw at it .
positive	thank_you and well one .
neutral	very poor construction , and looked weak before assembly .
neutral	i ordered the most expensive shoes i '_ve ever got myself as i fell in love with them .
positive	one of the best sites i have played on .
negative	beware food ordered and paid for did not arrive .
negative	if i didn_'_t pay them i '_d be cut_off yet they think it acceptable to withhold my money . scottish_power you are dishonest and a disgrace .

positive	really good customer service .
neutral	marek lorinc
neutral	your salesman robert was friendly , engaging and very helpful - he put us at ease and we were very pleased to buy our mazda 0 from him .
neutral	not convinced i will use it again , and if so maybe use a differnt supplier .
negative	unacceptable delivery and no per warning advice .
positive	i would not_hesitate to order from this company again and would highly_recommend them .
negative	i have contacted them again to ask for my money back .
neutral	sadly this is no_longer true .
negative	i want this 00_euros refunding to me .
positive	can '_t fault this .
positive	my item was delivered quickly too .
negative	last_year was exactly the same i should have learnt from last time but i ordered some items i was told i would receive 0 working_days_later , its been 00 working_days and i still_haven_'_t received an_email_confirming a dispatch of my order , i contacted elc who couldn_'_t tell me why they hadn_'_t been dispatched even_tho they are in their warehouse , couldn_'_t tell me when they will be dispatched , and that i will have to wait a further 0 working_days when they are eventually dispatched , so frustrating .
negative	this is the same company as taps0less . com and never send out items nor refund you .
negative	can they help further ?
neutral	i got a text at 00 :_00am saying " your flowers have left the building ."
negative	ordered my compression sleeves on the 00th of may , after a week my order hadn_'_t been processed so i emailed wiggle to ask them why . two_days_later no responce to my email prompted me to dispute the order with paypal .
negative	to save penny '_s on a item it is really not worth using this joke of a company .
neutral	long_queue at palma_airport , waited over 00_minutes at goldstar .
neutral	only_thing that would stop me using them again is the delivery .
positive	perfect_timing and quality of product
neutral	must have been quick as the reduced price was showing on my delivery day .
neutral	the goods arrived promptly with no_problems with delivery .
neutral	they were despatched when the company had said they would be when i ordered but i didn_'_t receive them for another week .
positive	these dvd / books are also detailed in the annual catalogue .

neutral	two batchs always differ in brightness and colour .
positive	i '_ve only used the site twice , but both_times have just been very smooth and problem free - including an_unexpected delivery on a saturday without_any extra_charges !
negative	the fault managers at talktalk are beyond incompetent , the customer service advisors actually seem to try to make things worse and i don_'_t know what the training manual at talktalk reads like but it must_say " if you dont_know what to do . just make it up !!!
negative	when we were eventually deposited in estepona we were left thoroughly unimpressed with the arrival transfer , however worse was yet to come .
neutral	it sort of defeats the object !
positive	service from mazumamobile was quick , effortless , and first_class .
positive	i would and have already_recommended this company to family , friends and colleagues .
positive	fast , reliable , polite service .
neutral	also there were delivery problems but that is probably not usns fault and more due to the delivery company .
positive	i have book marked you for the future
positive	thanks
negative	i have replied to every email they have sent but have never had a response in return .
neutral	i can only_assume that jpj have reduced the chances of a good prize so the more games offered and the more members joining the less likely you are to win .
positive	cheapest around .
positive	i received the goods by next_day courier as ordered in protective box , fantastic service as usual !!!!!!
neutral	this year the company that i have used previously to print my family year books was no_longer in business , so i transferred to photoworld and cewe .
neutral	affordable_supplements to their credit do then act quickly by either refunding or using another courier .
neutral	i don_'_t imagine my experience is the " norm ", but really not impressed on this occasion .
positive	0st rate service and fantastic value too .
neutral	overall summary , fantastic kitchen , fantastic value for money but sloppy service .
neutral	then this request for feedback arrived !
negative	so i placed an order before 0pm on the 00th , the postal option i chose was next_day .
positive	we then used 0 rolls of parcel tape .
negative	worst experience ever_since i have recently decided to change suppliers .

positive	sold last_week , saving 0k in fees .
positive	i cud track my order also i cud change mu delivery to drop next door .
neutral	ordering was easy and delivery was quick .
neutral	my order wasn_'_t initial processed and i had to remind global_bike .
negative	lind informed us she couldn_'_t do that as they hadn_'_t yet tried replacing the part .
neutral	the idea is fantastic but i gave my feedback to the company for the last two years but nothing has changed !!
negative	no response when was i going to get my parcel now ?
negative	i did manage to get through when calling at 0am but almost wish i hadnt as the person i spoke to was extemely unhelpful .
negative	hi friend
positive	it isn_'_t the best tasting powder iv ' e tried but if it does the job i '_ll put up with it .
negative	00 days after despatch and i '_m still_waiting in anticipation .
negative	i have nothing good to say about wowcher , don_'_t use them .
positive	the delivery was as stated and arrived on time .
neutral	delivery was shocking , i was concerned the flowers were being delivered by yodel who from experience are men in vans who i '_ve seen toss boxes about when looking for an item being delivered to me .
positive	well_done and many_thanks , would definitely use again .
neutral	so_far no_complaints .
positive	i highly_recommend supplement_warehouse to all my friends !
positive	by far the cheapest cable company i can find .
negative	no refund ! no item !
positive	then i found jessops_photo_book app and downloaded it .
neutral	i '_m a regular customer to this site but was very disappointed with my last order .
negative	after dozens and dozens of phone_calls to arrange delivery , none of which were actually answered , i gave in and collected it myself from the warehouse .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .

positive	fabulous service & great communications from this company , goods delivered next_day .
negative	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
neutral	they agreed , but once i got there , it turned_out they were running behind so had to return the following_day .
neutral	when we both got home , i was disappointed as the original accommodation was nearer to the town_centre and had access to a swimming_pool .
positive	i chose 0dvd fom the web and expected the transfer to take a little while . the film came back within 0_weeks and i have 0 copy to my daughter as her children featured on the small_amount that i had already seen . my daughter rang to say how delighted she was with the content before i had time to see it . it contained a christening , a christmas and 0 birthdays .
neutral	however , feel good contacts with the diameter of 00 . 0 makes it look rather natural .
neutral	always having problems with the connection and customer service .
negative	the 0 of us travelling to turkey had an awful experience with travelup .
neutral	i spoke to a customer service person and they didnt seem to know what they were talking_about .
positive	i applied on monday_evening , a phone_call to amigo_loans on tuesday & funds were in account tuesday_evening , so impressed
negative	this fraudulency needs lots of publicity to get these people out of business .
neutral	it looks_like what i '_ve purchased is incorrect because my ' pest ' problem still_exists .

negative	placed order 00 / 00 / 00 , still_waiting 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	why do you need my email address below .
positive	i have used mazuma 0 times now and have never been disappointed !
negative	they ended_up charging us double for four months until we finally got the problem sorted .
positive	great job and reliable .
positive	checked on internet and cheapsmells was best value .
negative	customers services have said they will not do anything to help as i have allowed it to get wet its not their problem .
negative	i cancelled the contract and the embarrassed employee promised that the money they had already started taking by direct_debit would be refunded .
negative	its common_sense that yodell are useless !
neutral	yodel brought them whilst my husband & i were out at work & unlike every other carrier didn_'_t leave the parcel at the local post_office .
positive	very efficient service .
negative	i have read some of the other reviews and the so special sales_team appears to write the same standard emails to everyone as a way of a delaying tactic .
positive	a good deal .
negative	since then money was taken from my account and still no phone .
neutral	first order not very impressed , horse_wormers not delivered no alternatives given .
negative	this was definitely not packaged by apple .
negative	i want a refund .

neutral	i was pushing the wheelchair along the pavement and i had to cross the road so i made for the drop down curb but my friend was jarred forward and i came to a complete stop and i had to have some help to get up the drop down curb , if it was not for the seat_belt my friend would have come out of the wheelchair .
positive	there are some really great deals on top brand_names .
neutral	bad coloured print out page after payment .
negative	hello ,
negative	they advertise cheaper good but dealing_with them is total_nightmare .
positive	consistently best or second best rate and conveniently close to my office to pick_up currency in person .
positive	leicestershire , uk .
neutral	it was supposed to come with a bucket of wood treatment free but have not received it and i paid for it putting up and only one man came to erect it and so my son - in - law had to help - very disappointed and will complain .
negative	bizarrely long_waits for the courier ( who have no phone number , web_site or contact address ) to bother to call you to inform you when , in the next few_months , they might do their job to try to deliver the goods .
positive	excellent service , would recommend to others .
neutral	newer have any similar experence with extra other tranfection for postage .
positive	waiting around for delivery and wondering will it come this week or next ,
negative	reason given delivery problems . no kidding !
negative	upon my first visit to the store to return the jacket i was told there was no one there to make a decision therefore someone would have to call me back to advise me if the jacket would be sent away for repair or i would get a credit_note / refund .

neutral	you used ups , they do not tell you by text etc . when they are gonig to delvier and attempted 0 times , i eventually went and picked it up .
positive	i used the whisky_exchange once to send a gift and now i use it for many birthdays and gifts .
neutral	so , for those reasons - which is either a lack of attention to detail or an intention to mislead - leads me to think that it would be quite dangerous to put my faith in their products when - as an athlete - you need to be sure exactly_what you are ingesting .
positive	really amazing service .
positive	concerns over colour were soon answered and proved to be wholly accurate when the items were received .
negative	i can just imagine the fun i '_m going to have getting a refund .
neutral	disappointed with the packaging on the t . v cabinet , it looked as though the cabinet was sent back due to the marks on the right hand door .
neutral	i ordered a strimmer which came with a free starter_pack containing safety mask , ear_defenders , gloves and fuel mixing bottle .
neutral	good and punctual service , the only_thing i would say is the delivery man didn_'_t have the comments i had written so he didn_'_t know that my mum couldn_'_t sign for the package as she has not the use of her hands .
neutral	well he would have had one from us , and one form the other supplier .
negative	the chocolates were ok but the message on the card was small writting on the back of a peace of paper !
neutral	winnings are up and down but i withdrew £_000 this weekend :)

positive	delighted with everything
positive	i then ordered online , it arrived 0 days_later .
positive	the holiday was wonderful and at every_stage of the journey everything_went as planned .

negative	sooooon
positive	service and delivery excellent .
positive	i couldn_'_t get this wrong and a quick and easy checkout - you didn_'_t need to set_up an account ( how rare ) if you didn_'_t want making it so easy .
neutral	next_day delivery good .
negative	holding costumers purchases to ransom like this isn_'_t right !!!
negative	you have not offered the service i paid for , and have been unable to offer any alternative to assist me , but you expect to keep £ 0 of my money for nothing !!
neutral	grrrr .
negative	they said the colour i ordered was now discontinued and that the new colour would arrive in the next few_days and they would despatch for delivery the folowing week .
negative	we wanted to return an unused computer as it had been bought in error ( the spec was incorrect ) micro care would not accept the return even_though we bought it on a card .

negative	i upgraded to a new phone with o0 unaware that they were using yodel as their courier service .
positive	loads of products at knock down crazy prices !
neutral	i think it is a great idea in principle to rate a restaurant , the fact is that ( not your fault ) it is difficult to assess how honest and unbiased the reviews are , how sensitive is the palate of the reviewer is .
neutral	carpet - not hovered properly and again from the pound shop , a rubbish £ 0 kettle that takes 00_minutes to boil , hated the foam pillows .
neutral	staff were polite and friendly .
positive	i wanted two of an item and they said the second will follow in ten days due to stock_levels .
positive	compare to others best price too recomended everytime hope they keep_up my opinion same for future !!!!!

negative	made a complaint to expedia by phone shortly_after arriving at the " hotel ".
negative	making the problem more unbearable was the very unhelpful response from the technical_support crew .
negative	below is the text of an_email received from [_name_removed_] of fireplaces0life today ( 00th_december ) a full 00 days after he was notified of the non - delivery of my order .
positive	its light_weight and hassle_free as it is cordless .

neutral	my main complaint is that the shopping was hurled down at us at the checkout , some of it fell on the floor , no offer of a replacement .
neutral	items were delivered quickly but not very well_packaged .
positive	this is quite possibly the best company around for delivering well above_average quality and yet at bargain prices .

negative	i obtained a business insurance quotes , sole purpose of pulling together a business plan for a new venture .
negative	ok there was a note on the website saying they were working on it , but it didn_'_t tell anyone what to expect .
neutral	the delivery company then phoned me to arrange delivery for 0_days_later - after some questionning from me the guy admitted they '_d already had the doors for 0_days but still couldn_'_t deliver for another 0_days - 0_days to deliver 0 doors ?!

positive	0 pm .
positive	will_certainly use you again .
neutral	it is of course possible that we would have had the same problem if i hadn_'_t had to change the details , but maybe something which needs looking into ?

negative	they charged me £_00 to book two cheap ryan_air flights

negative	**** 00 / 00 - have been calling over last few_weeks and have been sworn that i will get paid by today and there is nothing !!!
negative	was sent a " rose & lily hand_tied ".
neutral	!
neutral	ordered sun_cream on 0th_july , it is now the 00th_july and i '_m still_waiting .
positive	the viovet staff replied to emails very quickly , unlike any other company who reply in a few_days !
negative	you can do this continuously all morning and you won_'_t get an answer .
negative	i then had a further email a week_later saying that due to a ' transmission error ' they ' d not delivered them and what did i want to do - after a few emails back and forth i got confirmation that they ' d be delivered on 00th , a week after they were originally due .
neutral	opened and checked the contents and a key part missing making it useless .
positive	i will_definately be_revisiting the site and purchasing more products and would highly_recommend it to anyone .
neutral	everything ok , the space for logo could be bigger .
neutral	i am now just just awaiting my refund
neutral	though it takes 0 days from warehouse , then another 0 days assembly , a day to quality control it i assume .
positive	i asked them to dispose of the printer since it did not seem worth repairing .
negative	would i buy from them again . no .
neutral	would use ulookubook again .
neutral	would have been better if access to car_park had not been under improvement .
neutral	they did rectify immediately but i could have done without all the hassle .
positive	what a difference !
neutral	no tyres yet - waiting for new date .
neutral	i am sure this aspect could be improved .
positive	good range of products and speedy delivery .
positive	i '_ve_used mr_memory several_times before and received the same level of service and same standard of product .
neutral	the man i spoke to said there was no one there that could help me as it was a sunday so he told me to call back 0am on monday .
positive	straight_forward , easy to use and all completed within a couple of days !
neutral	they were nice , but very small .
neutral	the unit that was in stock was dispatched very quickly and arrived in good time .
positive	will be back here in future .
neutral	sixt offering " bring back car emplty " for a fixed cost , this can be cost_effective , but need to check fuel prices at time of travelling and the car fuel_tank capacity , plus gamble on not running out of fuel on returning for drop_off .
neutral	the review system is useless - will not let you give a bad review for those that deserve it - what is the point if all you can do is give a good one ?.
negative	where to start ?
neutral	so a bt of a mixed experience really but overall , i have to say whilst i was impressed to get a response on christmas day , i am very disapointed with what happened and their subsequent response .
negative	very bad feedback !
negative	even i brought an android_tablet from them via wowcher .
neutral	over all i think its good idea to have it but be patient .
positive	the goods are always dispatched right away and well_packaged .
negative	i ordered the flowers before 0am and was promised same day delivery .
neutral	this is disappointing when i had spent 0 , 000_pounds
positive	delivery was spot on too and much_quicker_than i expected , the item was carried right into the room and placed exactly where i wanted it .
neutral	very happy that i was let_down in time so that i could purchase the gas from elsewhere .
positive	with the help of the books i have selected my seeds and have everything ready to start them off indoors so i have something to plant in the tunnel when it '_s up .
negative	i just don_'_t understand !
neutral	the cost of filling up @ 000_euro is a joke , but i understand that money has to made somewhere .
neutral	- this was 00hr delivery !
neutral	like most people i got into debt slowly , due to no life style changes and decreasing value of my income .
positive	ordered new watch , delivered the very next_day , superb service and most certainly a company to be trusted to deliver exactly_what it says and on time .
negative	later the following_day i received an_email from the watch_hut telling_me the watch would not be supplied having been_discontinued by rotary .
neutral	throughout , they were very professional given the very busy time
negative	be warned - avoid extreme frustration and expense - do not deal with this company .
positive	as the payment was allready done , i had to cancel my paypal payment and make a new order as transferring my money back to my bankaccount would take several days .
neutral	well - would you wait in all day to receive your purchase - ordinarily i do not have to with dpd , tnt to name but two , you get a one hour delivery slot - not so with citylink - if you miss delivery , and you do not know when its coming as they do not email you , you get a choice of days when you are out , and , anyway if you were in , you have to wait in all day - so you have to get it yourself from the " local_depot " - 00 mile_round_trip .
positive	i will be ordering new spectacles from selectspecs within the next few weeks .
negative	the recipient of the flowers was really disappointed with the condition of them !
positive	again custom made within one week , largest custom fit offering in the web - exactly_what i '_m looking for .
positive	i now have an account , which gives me instant access to my history and tracking .
positive	thanks shoetique .

negative	items finally arrived .
positive	quick easy and does what it says on the tin
neutral	some years_ago i went to the kwik - fit garage in otley for new tyres and there the tyres were not delivered when they said they would be .
positive	i have used the online brewing company for a number of years and have never had any real problems with them .
neutral	i would '_ve thought she ' d have gotten this most_important detail nailed_down at the start .
neutral	the upstairs is fine but it is very small downstairs and my granddaughters age 0 and 0 have to bend down on all fours to access this area - not good at all .
positive	i have recently wasted a lot of time trying to get a particular_style of curtain_fabric in shops near me in stratford upon avon .
neutral	sort_out with multiple payment with paypal in the end .
positive	bought many things from this site had no_problems quick payment and delivery no_hassle
negative	they were fine for a couple of years but then they started sending zopiclone out of the secure blister packs and into the same chromium picolinate bottles other_reviewers have mentioned !
negative	there are several cases of this sort of screen cracking online .
negative	then i had a call off the person i ordered the flowers off that the next door_neighbour had been delivered them an had brought them round .
negative	that is if i can ever find anything in stock !!!!.
neutral	one of the conditions was an able_bodied person had to be available to take the order inside the house .
negative	however dear friends , guess_what !
neutral	the process started off very well , good communication , calls and emails answered_promptly then it went_downhill after we had paid the £_000 admin_fee .
positive	!
positive	i '_ve only ever bought genuine cartidges , not the compatible ones , so the quality is bound to be good and i can '_t comment on the compatible versions but the price is always good and the delivery speedy .
positive	perfect , 00 out of 00 .
neutral	would be happy to used them again as the competitive_prices out weigh deliver times !
positive	superb daytime pictures and , the night_vision is good too !
negative	zapper are poor at comms , very slow to pay and rejected a lot of dvds that were accepted by competitor at excellent price .
negative	the employees in this company are not able to read or choose to ingnore any e_- mail or any complaints that i have sent .
neutral	all booked and confirmed and paid £_000 for flights and extras with hotel to be paid on arrival .
positive	the items are very high_quality and are delivered very quickly .
negative	i can ensure a refund will be done however the trust_pilot review will need to changed to from a negative to a positive '.
negative	carpet fitter_turned_up at last .
positive	on telephoning the staff were extremely_helpful and knowledgable .
neutral	i paid in full .
neutral	however i found the packaging cumbersome for storage .
neutral	i took the car back - no_problems did it again .
positive	i highly_recommend .
positive	this site us simple to use , all the hotels i wanted to look at in a glance .
positive	what a refreshing_change for a company to have excellent customer service , second to none !
negative	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0_months .
positive	would have no_hesitation in ordering in future from base . com .
neutral	we had paid for a bmw and were offered a citroen , which we were sure was about half the value of what we had paid for .
negative	be warned that no matter what condition you leave the property in they will not return your deposit .
positive	i purchased a pearl necklace from laguna sometime ago for my wife which she absolutely treasures and now i wanted to provide matching earrings for her_birthday .
negative	despite the fact we were not to blame , i was made to feel_guilty about the fact the company ' could not claim the courier and would be out of pocket ' and to add_insult to injury , my emails were ignored when requesting my refund .
neutral	i have had numerous books from you now and this lat one seemed very expensive i am wanting to do more but to be honest will look elsewhere if i don t see a change in price .
negative	so why_advertise its for sale in the uk ?
negative	this is quite a underhand method of simply raising advertised prices on whim and misleading customers .
negative	i emailed them but they never got back to me .
negative	!
negative	i '_ve been a scottish_power customer for 0 years and finally i '_ve had enough !
positive	and the speed of delivery astounds me .
negative	always engaged .
positive	it was so easy to order and check out the video on the products !
negative	it needed to be returned and this was done with confirmation of receipt over 00 days ago .
neutral	it was only for a small sample of hair oil but they were so petty about it i will never buy from them again .
negative	there is no contact number to talk to a real_life human_being .
negative	to install new machine £_00 . 00
neutral	her only_gripe was she had to retrieve them from a house further up the road as you had delivered them to the wrong house .
positive	superb value and delivery .
positive	now that '_s service .
negative	day 0 - no parcel
positive	very good product very pleased good to find product that does what is says it will
neutral	i received notification that my booking had been cancelled because the description was not explicit enough .
neutral	would have been nice for them to have told me and not for me to chase .
negative	very small pink_roses , but the red_roses looked nice .
neutral	she said that while i did that she would prepare everything , but i was finished in a couple of minutes and had to wait quite a while for the assistant to have everything done .
positive	i found the price more competitive here then everywhere_else
negative	return did not happen .
positive	so easy to navigate the on - line booking system .
negative	no !!!!!!!!
negative	however , on entering the tracking_number into the ups website , i learn that i will be expected to pay a surcharge to them for the privilege of driving over there myself and handing in an item i have already paid to have collected !
neutral	thing .
neutral	the flowers got to the recipient but were delivered to and left at the wrong_address .
neutral	i tend to go to toolstation instead of screwfix .

negative	parecl0go need to up their game as opposition is now better .
positive	received great advice before purchasing product .
positive	they were beautiful , the service was excellent .
positive	second time of using this company and not had a problem .
negative	this is something i have never had to say before about any online company .
positive	quite possibly , my most satisfying online buying experience !
neutral	the problem was some of them looked a bit worse for wear , this still didnt detract_from the attention of the person_who they were for , but i would suggest that the people who make the arrangements check the flowers arent wilted or browning .
negative	we all want the best price we can find - but it may come with a hidden cost as above .
neutral	my mil was so disappointed - they had already started dieing with crispy petals and yellow leaves .
positive	this time i chose to get paid in argos_vouchers posted phone on monday_evening after work by special delivery , updated by mazuma the very next_day .
neutral	all she need to do was apologise and assure me that it would be looked into .
neutral	however the flowers have got to the right people anyway , so i will still use the service again .
positive	paid the money by card and received the item the next_day .
negative	the courier had put in a distant garage but no note posted through letter_box informing of this .
negative	however she did get a response which was you would give me 00_percent credit with a ok and goodbye .
negative	stud missing off the bottom with tape stuck across it so the fault was known before it was sent .
negative	haven_'_t heard back from recipient in grimsby .
neutral	this meant my builders could not do what they needed and work was delayed .
positive	i have bought several pairs of oakley_sunglasses from eyewear_outlet over the past couple of years and every time i get great prices and fantastic overall service .
positive	it '_s rare to find such a professional and personal service .
neutral	not impressed physio_room and if saw a product on your website would shop around before bought from you again
neutral	?
positive	top_class
neutral	the fact that i had to buy the first tank ( and return the car empty ) put unnecessary pressure on my holiday .
neutral	sadly it was necessary to return a day early from our scheduled 00 day drive in france and spain . this necessitated applying for a change in ticket for the return . the charge for the administration at £_00 one way on an almost empty boat was sheer extortion . and dfds know it .
neutral	he made it back and within 0 minutes of him being home , dpd delivered .
neutral	!
neutral	excellent service with original order , but when rang for advice as i wanted to exchange for a different pair as these did not fit properly was vague and was told not many sizes available so would be better with a refund , as i really want these before my holiday i felt a bit frustrated , so have returned them and ordered an_alternative pair and am waiting for them as to whether they are suitable or not
positive	amazon is top_notch for customer service - speedy delivery - good product - right price - when i had a defective game the returns system is quickest , easiest and the best i '_ve ever had to deal with :)
positive	the service was very efficient and speedy all_round .
negative	for what im not sure .
positive	and i was definitely not expecting next_day delivery .
neutral	i couldn_'_t change the place of delivery to my work and they required me to be at home from 0 . 00 am to 0 . 00_pm to accept re - delivery , ridiculous in this day and age .
negative	she said that the driver knows the area i live in very well and that nobody was living there .
negative	i ordered a chair on friday 00 - jan - 0000 .
negative	i know !!!.
positive	just such a pleasure
positive	i am still learning , but the guys are there if you need them .
neutral	they gave_me the wrong number for the folkestone branch i was trying to use , so i had to ring them back , and get the real number again .
negative	i was , at this point happy with the purchase .
negative	finally , i have to go to the trouble of writing a letter of explanation to accompany the returning quilt , which i have to wrap up and address , then await your driver to collect .
neutral	would not have purchased the outfit if i new it was spunch clean only
neutral	also , easy to get conned on not paying the best and required postage unless you have your wits_about you when ordering .
neutral	it all seems quite a lengthy time process !!
positive	we are very happy with the goods that we recieved , i would order again off them .
positive	always book our holiday in uk with blue_chip as they seem to have the best locations and best apartments too .
neutral	upon informing customer_care , pt assured that they will offer replacement bracelet links but i was expected to visit high_street to enact the repair ( and bear expense ).
negative	0 . blames everyone else when things go_wrong ,
positive	much_cheaper_than other_sites i checked and very quick delivery .
neutral	not happy at all and would definitely not use the site again .
neutral	i was not happy .
negative	i got back into cork late that evening and my flight back to uk was early next_morning so i was unable to visit the store .
neutral	or even told us that they could leave our delivery unattended on the driveway for us , personally i think asking for delivery any time on any day after 0 : 00 should not have been a problem .
positive	no_hesitation to recommend .
negative	if he was a bird he would fly .
positive	i recently_purchased two perfumes from this company and was very happy with both of them and to buy them at such a reduced price from shop prices was obviously fab !
negative	i have been on ebay for 00 years_now with over 0000 feedbacks .
neutral	it was listed at a price and said in stock , i dont give a rats ass if you messed it up i just need the flippig thing :(
positive	item was delivered the day after i placed the order - i did call to say there were no assembly_instructions and an exceptionally friendly helpful lady talked_me through how to set_up on the phone - very happy with the product and the customer service
neutral	consequently this meant that i had to rearrange delivery for the next_day and wait in again .
negative	i have never dealt_with a more obstructive and unhelpful outfit , this will be put under my comments for all to see .
negative	i '_m a professional studio owner who bought an extra fender american jazz_bass for use by clients .

neutral	excellent and the person they were for was over the moon .
positive	cheap prices and fast delivery .
neutral	when my mother received her flowers some of the heads of the gerbera where missing .
neutral	hi !
negative	on arrival at the hotel we were told there were no rooms booked for us , after producing my booking confirmation the hotel staff got into contact with lastminute . com and it turned_out that lastminute . com had not paid the hotel the balance for all the rooms .
negative	hope when some one reads this optimax might do something about my problem .
positive	smooth_transaction very fast despite_being new year thanq
positive	just the kind of supplier we all need , quick and very reliable .
neutral	early flights meant miserable cabin staff , the return in the afternoon was like being with a different airline .
negative	this is further highlighted by the fact that the customer service manager aledgedly repeated all of the steps i made to test out the system and also received no emails - my experience in relation to this is that i received no emails from superfi at all in relation to this initial purchase , which means nothing went to my spam_folder either - i received no emails in relation to my initial order .
positive	really good service from all concerned with the purchase and delivery .
neutral	loved the products but difficult to sort returns , not easy to exchange when required this lets the company down would not suggest you buy from procook if you are not fully sure what you want !
positive	wrong - my stupid thoughts that i had for years were put to one side and at last made me money .
negative	i placed an order for father '_s day which was advertised all over the website .
negative	i protested persistently and made reference to my statutory_rights but got nowhere .
positive	i was initially skeptical_about ordering online , but the whole_process was simple and straightforward .
neutral	so i then got to the front and the staff serving me was pleasant and appologised for the wait , computers then went down back to paper took him nearly three quaters of an_hour two phone_calls to the credit_card company .
positive	very good quality , look great .
negative	but i have to pay postage and packaging to send them to sweden .
positive	the bouquet was even better_than_expected .
positive	great price , good website with full details , fast delivery .
neutral	this time however glasses took_ages to arrive , not sure if i will use again .
negative	you get appologised too and promised it that same day .
neutral	this is a disappointment after such a great initial experience .
neutral	all items received quickly and as_described .
neutral	i also find it difficult to access animed via an apple ipad .
positive	their customer service support was superb
negative	i spent over 00_hours chasing this , jumped through_hoops for the staff at multitrip , completed all the forms , sent all the pictures from the holiday , did everything by the book only to be told we werent covered !
neutral	other than that all fine .
negative	be careful when ordering anything from them .
neutral	the worst part of the outfit by far was the wig , flat packed to within an inch of its life it came out of the wrapping and basically " puffed " out like an afro , after 00_mins frantic styling and pinning with the wife it resembled something like an elvis hairstyle but was very disappointing and i must_admit kinda spoiled the outfit .
positive	their protein_powder is a lot finer than other brands , probably due to the lack of gluten , but it mixes_well in super shakes , and the unflavoured stuff doesn_'_t leave a bad_taste in your mouth , like some other brands .
neutral	i was initially disappointed in the solution to the problem but the representative redeemed himself and i will_continue to use and recommend the company .
neutral	the delivery company chosen to deliver the product was difficult to contact .
positive	0 hour time_slot .
neutral	as its not held in stock by bestheating , i have to send in photos and wait for the supplier / manufacturer to come_back for a replacement part .
positive	peter russell - blackburn ,. lancashire
neutral	the proof of the pudding was when she asked me , towards the end of the conversation , which ankle i had broken .
neutral	we have had pills from you for a long time now but are very dissapointed in the glugosomine and crondroiton , they are always broken now and the powder is in the bottom of the tub , we are always throwing away the broken shells , if they dont improve in the next batch sorry we will have to find a new supplier .
neutral	the capsules are quite hard to perforate when you pull the handle down on the coffee_machine .
positive	love the coffees every bit as good as the nespresso_capsules .
negative	totally p ***** off with this company , ordered led_lenser seo0 focusing head_torch on the 0nd of november , allegedly dispatched on the 0th by royal_mail first_class .
positive	the rentify team are also easy to access .
negative	i contacted the parcel0 go call_centre on friday 0rd_december expressing my concern that the parcel has not arrived .
positive	perfect service a ********* very happy
negative	do not touch this company !!!!!!
neutral	i paid the extra for the next working day postage and did not receive it the next_day .

positive	thank_you
positive	full , clear fitting instruction .
neutral	i am still_waiting on the womens t shirt i ordered .
positive	the result to give most money for my galaxy_sii was money0yourphone . com and after some_research online , i opted for them .
positive	high_quality products at great price and delivered very quickly .
negative	i now have my gas supplied by n - power and i have to say the staff there are so helpful and understanding i can '_t wait to have my electric supplied by them . avoid fu phoned fu today 00 / 00 / 00 and have been on the phone for over 0 hours trying to sort_out their diabolical mistakes .
negative	i would spend the money on the phone_call if i thought it would get me anywhere but i '_m_sure i will be told that once the item is with the courier there is nothing they can do so why waste money .
positive	plus you get lifetime_warranty .
neutral	the tiles are perfect - fantastic value , and a great product .
neutral	0_days and still_waiting
positive	i ordered a new pc as i needed something for media storage in the lounge and having used dino_pc for the other computers i ' d needed recently it was a natural choice .
neutral	i was drawn to their high thread_count products , but in the end i had to return them .

negative	such a disappointment as it was a special surprise for my children .

positive	fantastic service from_start to finish .
positive	all_round good work .
negative	do not use this site i booked what i thought was a hotel it was a run down house in a absolutely_disgraceful area even some of the locals could not believe what we were staying in .
positive	friendly staff and great products .
neutral	i bought 0 shirts on one of the special_offer deals - they arrived promptly and were very nice quality .
neutral	the website says free delivery if your order is over_£_00 but that isn_'_t the case my last 0 orders were over_£_00 pounds and they still charged me £ 0 . 00 delivery when i queried it they told me they charged me because of the weight no mention of this on the website !

positive	quick , efficient service .
positive	00 og pakken_var hos mig næste dag .
neutral	at 00 : 00 i phone 00000000000 to try and find out where the delivery was .
positive	perfect !
negative	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
negative	we just wanted to pay the bill ( as were ready to do back in november when we closed our account with them ) and be rid of them , but of course were still_awaiting this final_bill with the correct amount on it .
neutral	overall , i would order again from edd , but would suggest they look at how these small things may lose them customers who may pay a few more pounds , but have peace of mind from larger seller who will honour these things .
negative	i guess this wasn_'_t authorised and no one is interested .
negative	i '_ve no idea who is looking at my photos and find it very disturbing .
neutral	the deals are good , but only the odd one comes up that i '_m actually interested in .
positive	plus the service was fast and the cost competitive .
positive	the ukelele i ordered arrived promptly , ahead of eta .
positive	cant_believe i ordered my washing_machine at 0pm and got it delivered 00am next_day .

neutral	original review
positive	the saddle came very well_packed and within a few_days of my order .
neutral	anyway , it worked out ok .
negative	although their initial service in supplying the wheels was good their subsequent service is extremely poor in that they do not honour any sort of guarantee .
positive	love flubit !
positive	?
positive	do try them when you are next in a jam !
negative	very disappointed .
negative	this was the fourth time .
negative	i bet you like my order , you take my money and don_'_t send my goods !
neutral	million_times better_than the delivery before .
positive	not to heavy for lifting in and out of car .
neutral	the flowers were received in good condition and in good time , however , there the picture of the bouquet on the website is very misleading - when it arrived looked a lot less and certainly doesn_'_t fill a standard vase .
neutral	then had to call again because very sent wrong_size .
positive	got my quote friday_afternoon . return pack turned_up saturday .
neutral	00mm 00mm 00mm & 00mm .
positive	the white lenses arrived day after ordering .

neutral	breakfast was cooked well but could have been a bit more substantial .
negative	i received a message to say the boots were not in stock ; however , they were debited from my account and in_spite of a promise to refund , they were never refunded .
neutral	communication is very good .
negative	!
negative	but i have been refunded after i contacted them .
positive	items arrived a few_days_later with instructions & proper packaging .
negative	then they simply stopped_replying to my emails .
neutral	miraculously , the flowers were wonderful , 00 red_roses , well_wrapped inside the box ( needed to be ) and in good condition .
neutral	web_page does not describe hinge type .
negative	we had not been able to check the box for these in_advance because the sink was so heavy we didn_'_t want to risk picking it up and dropping / damaging it .
positive	thanks again !
neutral	eventually made the 00 mile_round_trip to pick the roof_box up from the couriers which really defeated the object of buying online .
neutral	i cancelled my commitments and waited in and got bumper about 00 . 00pm .
positive	great experience all_round , was kept up to date with progress and cheque arrived promptly .
positive	i would definitely suggest lovestretch as it has quirky brands but everything is high_quality .
negative	which could not go to as we were doing a theme and every were else was sold out last_minute .
positive	soak and sleep to the rescue , a new parcel delivered to me in less_than 00_hours from contacting them to discuss the situation .
positive	easy to order .
negative	apparently they ' re experiencing problems & they are common at this time of year .
neutral	the sizes were a little large and the quality of the products wasn_'_t brilliant , but it was good enough for the price .
positive	thank_you for the great service .
neutral	i got an_apology for the delay in delivery of the car but no explanation for not replying to my calls or emails (' the emails must of gone into my junk_folder ') the next_day it got better again , i had a call from the admin_team to tell me my car was ready and will be delivered in 0_days !
neutral	when it goes well it is average .
neutral	while providing me with a list of what " should " have been in the bouquet might have been helpful at the time , the flowers are long since gone and there is no way to " check " now .
negative	ended_up raising a claim through paypal for refund .
negative	cancelled an order with simply_electronics on the 00th_october after_placing an order on the 00th_october and still no refund !
neutral	however , there '_s just something about paypal that i can '_t quite put my finger on ; it really feels_like they ' re lacking a useful presence .
negative	the keepers jersey turned_up on the friday , just in time , but the print quality was as poor as on the tops we had received !!
neutral	however .
negative	if you are looking for a trust_worthy alternative to the high_street banks , the ybs isn_'_t it .
negative	as a business customer i expect a response from a lodged complaint .
positive	i would have no_doubt using this site again
neutral	i found the web_site fine and ordered a gift voucher for my son .
positive	delivery details advised by text and email 0 - 0 days ahead .
negative	i should add they '_ve also sent the wrong guitar lead .

neutral	i ordered 0 of the same unit , at time of ordering , the website seemed to indicate that both units were indeed available .
positive	hi you must use mazuma for your old_mobiles .
neutral	i still have no idea if my goods have been sent even_though i ordered two_days ago .
positive	there really are no strings , i couldn_'_t_believe it until i tried it and i just got £_00 back - brilliant , i am telling_everyone i know .
negative	please steer well clear of wowcher and their not so amazing a deals .
positive	had to ring the helpline to find out how to change the delivery options ( awkward to find when paying by paypal ) and telephone staff were very friendly and most helpful .
neutral	it had been wiped over and looked terrible due to the snow / salt marks on it so i couldnt really examine it for damage .
positive	fantastic service , fast delivery !
positive	thank_you prestige_flowers i '_ll be back !
negative	i will not be using them again and would not recommend them .
neutral	saga with getting the correct glass to fit the windows but all tradesmen involved have been first_rate and the finished product is excellent .

negative	i spoke to the manager and he said exactly the same !
negative	regards
neutral	ordered an ex - demo marantz sr0000 available receiver at a very good price .

negative	i tried to call , but their " award_winning call_centre ” phone line , said there " was a fault ".
negative	george
negative	not very helpful indeed when the shop is busy .
neutral	quick delivery with no_problems , but the box seemed a bit worse for wear , plus the box with the glass in was torn inside .
neutral	i phoned twice in the morning yesterday , no one answered both_times .
negative	i phoned again and asked why i had been told it was out for delivery when it was clearly not and i found i was dealing_with one of the most useless rudest company '_s i had ever delt_with .
neutral	i contacted pet_supermarket and , whilst their customer service was very polite and friendly , it took another 0_days before i received my correct order .
negative	amazon will never do this .
positive	great prices , products & delivery .
neutral	the items in themselves i '_m more than happy with easy for me as i '_m fairly confident around computer equipment to fit and use .
negative	they arrived close to 0 pm but because of where they were left they were collected by me by good fortune at 00 pm they could have been stolen .
negative	:)
neutral	our last order is a fused mass of unusable capsules and as yet we have had no response from the supplier .
neutral	instructions would be useful .
neutral	all the same , after i washed it and the fluff stopped coming it looked good on my bed .

neutral	we paid for a platinum cottage due to coming with our elderly_parents one with dementia and for us to have no_worries and stresses , as we were caring for them , it was sad that we did not have the service we were expecting .
negative	cheaptickets - the internet is a 00 / 0 online marketplace .
positive	would definitely book again as they were also cheaper_than the competition . which is always a bonus !
negative	having had a bad_experience with another online company pretending to be a uk organisation , i re - ordered a camera through valuebasket . com , again not realising they are based overseas and pretend to be a uk company with phone numbers etc .
neutral	two black cartridges were dud , i . e .

positive	i was very impressed by this professional , efficient and fast service .
neutral	and i upgraded for more blossoms but they arrived in 0 separate bunches rather_than one large bunch .
neutral	possibly , given another great deal , and the fact that i now know my way around the software , but i would ask for the album to be better protected in the post .
positive	it all worked out nicely .
negative	due to the massive two and a half month wait and the disgusting customer service , i decided to change my order to a different watch .
neutral	i highlighted this to jules_b , and asked that they refund me the difference to save me sending the dress back however apparently this us against policy and they '_d rather receive the dress back .
neutral	i had to spend £_00 to get the discount .

negative	however the item developed a fault and as a result i had to send it back .
neutral	efficient and polite fitter so perfectly happy with the end_result but a little annoyed that the online booking allows selection of a slot the very next_day when in actual fact the representative calls to allocate the job with a wait of over a week .
negative	" hopefully it will turn_up "

positive	the reduced isle is great bargain find on a friday_night .
negative	my sister constantly tried to get_hold of management at the company and was told that the two members in charge were not available and they would return her call .
negative	and the customer service girl on the helpline told me the fastest way was to get to a nearest tmobile store and pick_up replacement sim at £_00 !
positive	not sure how to remedy this .
neutral	this was no use to me as my car was booked in for its mot first thing .

neutral	that will help me decide_whether to use your site again for future orders .

positive	mattress in place i couldn_'_t wait to go to bed that night to see if there would be a difference , & wow . that night i had the best nights_sleep in ages !
positive	very pleased with the service received
positive	previously i have owned four_pairs of ecco chiltern shoes over the the last 00 years .
negative	they initially offered me £_00 for my ipod .
neutral	unfortunately , as it dried more and more bubbles appeared and i because it had dried they couldn_'_t be removed .
neutral	i would strongly_recommend sleepeezee luxury backcare 0000 .
neutral	i '_ve chosen this service because i wanted one booking number assigned to the booking concerned multiple flight companies .
negative	worse still i complained a week_ago and the only response i have received so far is an_email to say if i don_'_t receive a response in 00 working_days that i can phone them .
positive	needed a comfort height toilet , shower bath and basin , others did all but the toilet and a few did all but for a lot more money than bestbathrooms . com .
neutral	haven_'_t had cause to fault transtools yet so until then i '_m happy to keep using them .
neutral	de service van_de_levering was goed_en op_tijd maar ik had eigenlijk een notificatie verwacht dat u misschien mijn gekozen produkt niet meer beschikbar had .
positive	email communication also very good .
negative	was going to try 0g that it had been banging on about since last_year but find it '_s now only a trial that i need to apply for and it '_s limited to 0gb .

negative	i ordered set of furniture , and when the delivery did not arrive , i called and i was told it had not left the depot .
neutral	the holding email about stock being delivered in mondays didn_'_t make a huge_difference .
neutral	placed the order for a schuberth helmet and a blue mirror visor - the visor arrived in 0 days . the helmet was noted as coming from the chichester branch . after another 0 days there was no sign - a quick call to the customer desk and it was immediatly resolved and dispatched within an_hour .
negative	i did not like this perfume and my husband suggested that igive it to a charity_shop .
negative	both_times it took over ten days to get here , the second time it took two_weeks !
positive	instant on line quote , documentation and easy to follow postal instructions the next_day .
neutral	in the end
positive	no wires are on view from the front .
neutral	i would say that the price reflects what you actually get , its cheaper on hear for a reason , it feels_like they might be seconds , some had a few marks on , but they are so much_cheaper on plo , i feel happy to except the flaws .
negative	i called them and was informed that ’_s the way it is , i could not be_bothered to argue and reluctantly_accepted the reduced price and stated as they were paying me used price i wanted the box and all the accessories back 0_weeks on i still have not received these .
neutral	really hope this company does well , just a few things to iron out !
positive	sent phone and email received 0_days_later to confirm_receipt .

negative	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
neutral	just as well you have good staff at your call_centre .
neutral	well_done .
positive	have used site a few_times with no_problems .
neutral	they also send out way too many mails before & after your purchase .
neutral	found product and it looked okay the sales_guy wasn_'_t too pushy and was mostly helpful .
positive	they have the retro_style i love and expect from the brand , and yet , they have some modern , edgy twist that make them current .
positive	the apartment was clean and well finished and one of the best we have stayed in whilst holidaying in newquay .
negative	it '_s now daytwo , and still no delivery has_been made after sending numerous_emails to their customer service .
positive	the flowers arrived by midday and she described them as ' really beautiful '.
negative	!
negative	( count ' em )
negative	!
neutral	this is an ok cashback site but payout and customer service can be slow sometimes .
negative	ordered a tyre on thursday went to have it fitted on saturday
neutral	however , i was pleased with the goods when they eventually turned_up , and gxl very quickly sorted_out the exchange for one of the items that was sent to me in error by the manufacturer .
positive	posted 0 separate jobs , almost all offers arrived within 00_hours , and the service from the accepted party was excellent .
negative	all i can say is ; poor quality , poor customer service and therefore overpriced .
negative	called the customer service but is absolutely no helpful .
positive	it was better_than i expected .
positive	the web_pages are easy to use .
positive	thanks , this service always works well for me on my annual visit to the uk .
negative	don_'_t list items for sale that are not for sale .
negative	perhaps the criminal lawyers amongst you can tell me whether a failure to do either is theft or fraud .
negative	had not recieved it a week_later , i e_- mailed them to ask how long it would take , was told item out of stock , getting more in next week .
positive	i am very pleased .
positive	it was the best price i found online and the products were great .
negative	i waisted the best part of the day waiting in as i was given the wrong information about the progress of the parcel .
neutral	there was no way of talking to the company to find out an approx delivery time - not even a morning or afternoon and i had commitments which_meant i couldn_'_t stay in all day .
positive	they ' re cheaper on all of the websites i '_ve looked on and my purchase was delivered 00_minutes early was packed well and nothing was damaged would recommend affordable_supplements to all my friends and family .
positive	product was exactly as_described and was at a fantastic price .
positive	and zoey said they would do everything possible to have the ring ready in time .
negative	had message today from royal_mail ( monday , so 0 days now ) to say flowers have been delivered .
negative	it is very unlikely i will by from ellis_brigham again
neutral	batteries required : 0
negative	very upset with your so called service !!!!!!!!!!
negative	i waited the two_days .
positive	we are going to order another couple of pairs so he can have spares in the car , office etc .
negative	title_says it all
negative	i tried to buy a camera for my wife .
negative	booked online and the confirmation_email didn_'_t come through .
negative	i waited in as given the hour_slot .
negative	buyers_beware !
negative	once i couldn_'_t pay my bill , i rang them to tell them , and to tell them when i '_d be able to , and they essentially talked for ages and told me they couldn_'_t do anything , i '_d continue to get calls about it and they would stop my services on a certain_date regardless .
negative	there are ways around the os support but i find the ignorance disrespectful .
neutral	places my order was told that one item was not in stock , waited 0_weeks to be told that 0 item was no_longer avalble ( even_though still advertised on site ).
negative	i went to purchase a leather_jacket from superdry '_s ebay store that had 00 days left on its listing and a buyitnow price of £_00 . 00 - but superdry decided to stop the auction and re - list the item at £_000 . 00 ( over 00_% higher ).
negative	not a happy experience .
neutral	i received the item in question ( slightly later than hoped ) but the delivery team were simply excellent and would not accept a tip ( suggested i donate to charity which i did ).
neutral	what happened to customer service where they want to look after the customers ??
positive	no_qualms in recommending them and i '_ll happily be using them again .
neutral	instead amazon are trying to entice you to purchase the film rather_than simply wait for the rental to become_available .
negative	this company is criminal . they prescribe prescriptions which don_'_t need to be given .
positive	i '_ve_used it once and it '_s done all i expected of it .
negative	of course there was no one answering release travel " we '_ll be there should have any_problems " emergancy phone line .
negative	however that person denied the company was overcharging me and when i said i was not in the office at the moment and was unable to give detailed_information about the over charging because i didn_'_t have the invoices in front of me , the put the phone down .
positive	best of both_worlds : internet prices , changed at reputable fitting chain .
positive	hi , there ,
neutral	b ) i would be responsible for the postage unless there was a " fault "
neutral	could do better
neutral	it makes ordering plants a risky business .
neutral	i checked my emails again only to find that both payments had gone_through and i now had two coats on their way .
neutral	some may have had one bad_experience and are set on giving a poor report as a result rather_than give an overall experience .
negative	luckily received the item a couple of hours before i had to wear it .
negative	had nice flowers for mothers_day but the ones i bought for girlfriend where poor quality , a few dead leaves and a rose had fell_off when i opened the box
negative	to then take a further week to credit back my card is adding insult , why not charge credit_cards at the point of dispatch ?
neutral	now i understand that it '_s not possible to stock every_single product available .
positive	also easy to use website , and quick replies .
positive	upon_arriving home i spent a lot of time trying to find them for a reasonable price , and after much searching found that one of the first sites i had been on had them for the best price !
negative	i won_'_t be ordering again any products from them as this breaches my basic trust and it is too much hassle to try and get your money back after the fact .
neutral	unfortunately that is what you will do currently if you opt for these pods .
neutral	i would have liked delivery within the given time frame , but having used citylink before , they ' re not the greatest courier in the uk !
neutral	really .!
positive	excellent value for money on all products i purchased .
positive	they do what they say they will and the transaction arrived when they said it would !
positive	much_cheaper_than my own vet for the products i require on regular_basis - special food for cats and joint_supplements for dogs - some as much as 00_% cheaper !
negative	we ordered from [_link_] in broadgreen liverpool . our order contained meals and soups . the food was not hot and the soup had burst_open all over the bag ,, i rang to complain and was told more soup was to be delivered . no apology . and soup did not arrive . poorly run business . i would not recommend it to anyone !
positive	very speedy delivery , and regular_emails to keep track of the delivery .
positive	i got my product for a good price with delivery included !
neutral	i specifically_asked it to be put in our enclosed porch which was unlocked .
negative	first , i was accused of breaking it myself , even_though it had only been delivered about 00_minutes prior .
neutral	my husband was booked with a different insurer and claimed for just the same things as me ( we each claimed 00_percent of the joint items ) but his claim was paid in full .
negative	i also think the hidden_charges are very high .
negative	i phoned the expensive helpline on monday and after sitting on hold , going through lots of menus i eventually explained the situation .
neutral	choosing tuffnells for the delivery sevice is not one of you best decisions .
positive	absolutely best service , price , convenience , quality .
negative	what a complete_waste of time this company is .
neutral	the item i bought ( olive coloured kraft_paper roll ) was only available at rajapack .
positive	received all goods in the right quantity which were as_described and packaged well - oh , and they arrived in a timely_fashion too .
neutral	mistakes were corrected quickly , quibble - free and courteously – however there were far too many and they really shouldn ’_t have happened .
neutral	it may not be a good reflection of their normal service but my stay at meridian apartments in cardiff was marred_by having so little useful pre_- stay information and this had a knock on effect when we got there to find lots of the usual services we enjoy were missing .
positive	easy to use , i requested a bag and that came within 0_days , i posted on a tuesday and payment was in my bank by thursday of the same week , very quick payments and very happy with the service
negative	can '_t_believe they didn_'_t even have the courtesy to call me and let_me know what was going on .
negative	- all_kinds of hidden_costs .
negative	i had a couple of domain_names with 000 reg and they sent me an_email in nov 00 saying that my card_details had expired and that unless i updated them they would not be able to autorenew .
neutral	as it happens i wouldn_'_t have minded in the slightest had someone explained this to me , however when i rang to check the delivery date was as agreed at the outset i was initially met with confusion followed_by a wall of silence and found that no one returned my calls , in the end i was left with 0 unanswered telephone_calls and 0 unanswered e_-_mails and then had to rent a car ( at some expense ) to cover the interim period - all of which could have been avoided had someone simply contacted me .
negative	any postcode i '_m in , inconveniently , exists in a " network hole ."
positive	with no doubts hostelbookers is the best hostel reservation website .
neutral	downloading the software and putting it together was really good and easy .
positive	the delivery man was a bit rude but that '_s not this company '_s fault .
neutral	chemist_direct should offer more free or low postage offers .
positive	item was dispatched quickly and i received the items far quicker_than the time stated .
neutral	they arrived within about 0 days , which is within their quoted_timescale but nowhere_near what others offer .
negative	no call back .
neutral	not a patch on the quality of stars purchased in asda at a cost of £ 0 .
positive	drill ordered arrived promptly and for the money seems very good value .
neutral	the advertisment at the end of your screen appears to be part of it and i did not realise that my order had been sent already .
neutral	my husband could have grown a beard in that time !.
negative	got a phone_call the day before delivery to inform_me they were not in stock ( they did not know until they went to load the van apparently ).
negative	hvis_du tænker på at skifte dit nuværende forsikringsselskab ud til topdanmark , så vent med at træffe din beslutning til du har hørt min historie om , hvordan det_gik for mig da_jeg_skulle skifte .
neutral	so i ordered again .
negative	when i tried to call to resolve this , there seemed to be no way to speak to a human .
neutral	that said , the last time i used them , my parcel arrived damaged at its end destination .
negative	so frustrating .
negative	very poor .
neutral	this was changed for a more appropriate appointment .
negative	he '_s unfailingly_helpful and cheerful . the royal_mail could really do with employing a few thousand more like him !
positive	very pleased with the quick delivery & securely_packaged product
negative	after along awaited delivery ( which didn_'_t turn_up 00st_october waited in all day ) finally 00 . 00 sat 0 november bed_base is delivered only to be dragged across the back of the lorry by the driver who damaged all 0 corners of the bed breaking the packaging and scuffing up the faux edging and wasn_'_t bothered at all infact quite rude !
positive	best online price , free_postage and quick delivery - what more could you ask ?
negative	in all dealings i have made over the internet i have never ever had such a bad_experience , i received the email about the nottingham distribution center being delayed to the 00th .
positive	brilliant prices .
neutral	on my paperwork where 0 numbers .
positive	having purchased some frames online , rmg were so much_cheaper to glaze them than on the highstreet .
negative	after i enquired i got rather a cheeky email_saying it was a mistake on the website and that i should have known it was not free !!!!
positive	was very impressed only took a few_days and was here and the quality is fab would defiantly recommend partyrama to any one of my friends and family .
negative	waited 00_minutes to talk to someone then was told needed to be put through to someone_else .
positive	found you on the computer , and i can_honestly_say that you fulfilled my every wish !
neutral	ringede nogle dage_efter , da_jeg kunne_se på_min ordreside , at der_var_en radiator i restordre .
neutral	eventually got a second bunch of flowers after disappointment with the first .
neutral	we were really happy with the products we bought ( a set of skis with bindings and a snowboard ) although we have not tried them out yet !
neutral	ordered my item in good faith as website showed it was in stock .
positive	however , a brief phone_call was all it took to resolve the matter and the missing item arrived the next_day .
neutral	also it came wrapped in what looked like a black bin bag - no branded packaging / box etc .
negative	absolutely_shocking !!
negative	so no_worries then ….
positive	now having a very comfortable sleep :-)
positive	i would recommend them always '.
negative	she pointed me to the spam problem after resending the email .
negative	it is worth_noting that the poor fitting of the leg was such that there was a complete 0 - 0 mm gap_between the top of the leg and the undersurface of the table .
positive	otherwise all good .
negative	0 of the items was out of stock .
neutral	on returning car to goldcar no more damage added asked for deposit to be returned informed it '_s automatic but allow up to 0_weeks .
positive	quick shipping , good quality of product , reasonable_price
negative	i have been chasing scottish_power ever_since to , first , accept my final meter_readings , second , close my account and refund £_000 . 00 .
negative	fordralet :_00000 samsung i0000 galaxy_s0 croco 0 00 , 00 00 , 0000 - 00 - 00 0
positive	the watch looked good on the website but even better in the flesh .
negative	he then checked their computer system to see that the booking was on and he discovered that it was .
neutral	emphasis on how he '_d made sure he '_d got the tyre fitted to help me out .
negative	went on booked delivery .
positive	best price i could_find for my item and delivery so quick it showed up the day before release !
negative	i rang to order either a 0000 or 0000 gold sovereign following an e_- mail i received stating that a mixed_bag had been received into bullion .
negative	i will be arranging for a account with ups directly since the middle_man doesnt_seem to want to work for his money .
positive	after waiting nearly 00 years to get new windows and a front_door , the experience with safestyle couldn_'_t have been better .
positive	it now stocks the colour i really wanted .
negative	i have contacted you but apparently i have to wait_until wednesday next week .
negative	i have also contacted watch dog to report them .
negative	as with many of the people below i ordered a bean_bag via_groupon on 0th_november for a christmas_present and it '_s not arrived and i cannot get a response via_email or telephone - i '_ve tried several numbers .
positive	i ordered a shield with engraving - excellent service
neutral	products are a very good price but the service lets it down .
positive	i spoke on the phone to breakingfree to get some advice re delivery etc , at 0 . 00pm
negative	!
neutral	the bombing and spray helped , i made sure to follow the instructions and advice i found on this website .
positive	t | he usbs are of a good quality and the printing was excellent , good value for money .
positive	very happy with my shopping_experience
neutral	this was not explained when making the booking .
positive	i love the products .
neutral	the flowers were very nice but the amount of flowers was considerably_less_than i feel was needed for the £_00 price_tag .
negative	i have just had two months of being run around by talk_talk '_s customer_services .
neutral	it turns_out that this delivery time is misleading as the 00 day cooling_off period and the time it takes for the finance to be completed is not mentioned until you are well into the process .
positive	arrived in no time and at the time specified .
negative	have since looked up their credit_history they have four ccjs out againest them , and even then they haven_'_t paid up .
neutral	the item took too long to arrive considering delivery cost £ 0 . 00 , i didn_'_t receive the item for a few_days , the courier failed to collect the item twice .
negative	problem where there site suddenly decided it didn_'_t recognise our postcode as a collection address - having phoned interparcel and spoken to numerous people who suggested various things which didn_'_t work - nobody really seemed particularly bothered - my last dealings with this matter , a supervisor promised to phone me back to sort it out after supposedly going away to look into in more depth - they never did .
neutral	your coffee_pods are improving but still have a little way to go to equal nepresso pods
positive	can you believe it , holiday_autos wanted just over £_000 for a 0 week hire .
positive	service in the deepdale store was good and attentive - to be offered a coffee as we had just driven home from hampshire was most welcome .
neutral	i was a little disappointed by the colour - but you can never be sure on the internet , can you ?
neutral	but they had it in stock , so i ordered anyway .
positive	keep the good work up guys
negative	disgusting behaviour , they should be ashamed .
neutral	this service would be the best if there shops were more friendlier , every one in our area are so ignorant and make you feel terrible for dropping your parcel off a big letdown
neutral	above title perhaps not a fair reflection on sweatband as the ordering_process on their site was straightforward and included a healthy discount .
neutral	didn_'_t see this clearly mentioned on the front page
neutral	if dfds charged reasonable prices on board their customers would spend twice as much .
positive	i would not have any hesitation in recommending them to family , friends and business colleagues .
negative	i once logged_into the system to look around and have since been bombarded by junk_mail from people i don_'_t know wanting to be my friend !!
neutral	now , however , there is a loss of trust so it is not likely that i would use your company again .
positive	will be purchasing my shoes this way next time
negative	so far no tickets , can '_t get to talk to anyone via the ' contact us ' 0000 as all automated , sent a mail and had an auto response .
negative	i will never or from this company again and never recommend anyone i know to order either .
negative	asos have no contact number and no e_mail address and you literally have to go through loops on their automated answer system to send them an e_mail .
positive	great range of top_notch products and they are a pleasure to do_business with .
neutral	[ erhaps you will ask me to review the transaction when they arrived and are fitted !!
negative	take out a contract of any kind with this company , they will rip you off and threaten you as they have me .
positive	definatley buy from these again no_hastle buying and waiting in for deliverey
neutral	i paid £_00 and had to spend extra money on customising my outfit so it was fit to wear !
neutral	very disappointed that due to ultralase joining with optimax i have to travel all the way to glasgow for my ( 0 week ) after appointment instead of going to aberdeen .
neutral	i purchased it in sale cheshire at the end of october and by end of december it seemed to no work .
neutral	my previous order , with another company , on the internet i was kept_informed at all_stages and given an_hour_window for delivery and my product arrived within that hour .
neutral	their website indicated the item was in stock and so i ordered .
positive	the guy was friendly and the delivery came exactly when promised .
positive	highly_recommended !
negative	i contacted pharmacy0u one week_later , only to be informed that my order was not in stock , and further more , had never been in stock at the time of ordering .
negative	called last_week for a refund .
negative	order took_ages to arrive and unlike last_year - the returns were customer responsibility and it unfortunately cost a fortune to return to sweden .
negative	however , as i was not given the option to select saturday delivery , the products arrived on monday .
negative	earlier in may my family and i found ourselves without a place where to stay on our first night in tel aviv .
neutral	i did try tesco first but it kept on crashing .
positive	they swapped the guitar with a perfect one and collected the dog within 0 days .
negative	on the delivery day i received a call and was told that they dont have it in stock .
negative	on return i again photographed all elevations and returned the keys to a hole in the back of the van , things were looking up , there were now 0 pallets stacked up , for customers to reach , the service window .
positive	excellent and fast service with good quality goods at a excellent price
positive	the model i initially ordered was no_longer available and they offered me the newest one at the same ( very good ) price .
neutral	it took a week for me to receive my items and i only got a delivery date the day before but power direct did answer all my emails and were very helpful on the phone but my problem was delivery was coming direct from manufacturer so difficult to find out when i could expect delivery .
negative	watchop customer service was totally abysmal .
negative	guess i dont need to say anything_else .
neutral	- i never use any supplier if i know the delivery is by citylink .
positive	great service and we would use them again .
neutral	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
positive	found the website easy to navigate .
negative	this changed when i was overcharged by a third_party using direct_debit .
negative	but they weren_'_t .
neutral	second issue : i would like an_email_confirmation that my order has_gone_through .
positive	strongly recommended to all my friends and family !
positive	as always healthy_pets staff made adding a new pet to my policy quick and easy .
positive	service .
negative	when i challenged the definition of the word , ' recently ', and they said anything up to 0 months .
neutral	too expensive for such a small item .
negative	how can i send back when i still have not received them .
neutral	ups delivered on the wrong day and didn_'_t ring ahead as they said they would .
neutral	so don_'_t give up yet if you '_ve ordered something .
neutral	didn_'_t get confirmation they had been delivered till 0am the next_morning .
positive	what can i say about this company ?
positive	i ordered these sunglasses online , best price i could find and amazingly , they arrived the next_day .
negative	i have also found out that had i gone direct to the car_hire company i would have paid 00_% less for the identical rental and received much_better insurance_cover .
neutral	had to buy other food in mean time thus changing dogs ' diet and so the two pups got a dicky tummy .
positive	they regularly have cheap offers like £ 0 postage or cheap surplus stock etc .
positive	love the service , love the free_postage , love the free_returns and sorting my dilemma of my own making without_fuss or refusal ; best price on the internet too !
neutral	i am very pleased with the car ( titanium model ). quality and comfort is excellent ,
positive	when i ordered three leds directly , there arrived practically overnight and only one (!)
positive	i have already_recommended this company to friends and i will use them again next time without_any hesitation .
negative	inconvenience your work_colleagues , your boss and your daily family routine
negative	update in response to superfi '_s response :-
negative	don_'_t waste your time and risk downloading something you cannot get_rid of .
negative	we have recently ordered a blue green rug from made .
positive	her reaction was " wow , they ' re stunning !"
neutral	i placed this order on 00 april , which was despatched on 00 april and not received until 00th_april .
neutral	there website said they ' d been and left calling_cards but they hadn_'_t
neutral	very disappointing as usually very good service is provided
neutral	there is also no email sent to notify of goods dispatch .
neutral	i will however keep a close eye on specialtech for improvements as they are far from the terrible company but until then i think i '_ll need to stick with scan
positive	great quick delivery and the shoes are fab .
positive	cars are in the hotel car_park and are thoroughly checked before and after hiring so advise to buy excess_insurance .
negative	i have never recieved a reply , even after writing via snail_mail to find out where the missing items that i have already paid for are !!
neutral	in reply to this they offered me a £_00 refund which i accepted
negative	booked a week holiday hotel in italy from uk .
negative	it has_been an aggravating experience which is far from over .
negative	!
negative	i did not complain but i promise i will never order anything anymore from this website .
negative	they almost seem to condone the 00_% mark up in fuel_costs which i think is outrageous .
negative	the next_morning , a lady called me asking me why the item wasn_’_t deliver .
positive	definitely recommended .
neutral	i didn_'_t return it because the cat was going frantic and i needed to get it in and working otherwise i would have done .
negative	i was assured that was in order .
neutral	why do some have it and not others ?
negative	i asked if the carrier they used to deliver it could be contacted to help and i was told no again .
negative	better to cancel and get another_provider who can actually help you ' d think but that will cost me 000 hard_earned pounds apparently .
positive	thanks to all at villa_plus .
negative	i will never again place an online order with toolstation & you out there now also have been_warned .
neutral	colin g mead .
negative	instead they and used cheap fillers like baby '_s breath .
positive	the price looked really good .
neutral	whilst it is very good and comprehensive , it is too large for me and i don ; t think they do one these days at the size and info that i want .
positive	the worktops ( prime_oak ) have now been oiled and installed and look absolutely_stunning .
negative	put on amazon or e_bay after that they will let you down .
negative	no email for dispatch or nothing to suggest that there was any kind of delay .
positive	superb service ,
negative	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
positive	!
negative	no one rung so i tried the online_chat route .
neutral	i received an apologetic email to say that the product was unavailable , however , instead of confirming a full_refund , i was again given the option of an_alternative with a full_refund being available if i did not respond within 00_hours - resulting in a delay of receiving the refund .
positive	the bathroom was delivered on time as promised and the delivery driver was very helpful .
negative	they claim any enquiries will be answered within 00_hrs .
neutral	took a couple of attempts to get across that key was already in use .
negative	asked neighbours to know avail ????
positive	the product is like as_described at the announcement and was delivered in a short time .
positive	easy to use website .
neutral	fast service and pleased with item but due to bad customer service i will not order from them again !
neutral	very frustrating and a little common_sense would have been nice however i was told to reorder the cartons and pay another fast track shipping charge .
negative	i have made a serious complaint about a member of staff in the brixton store , 0 telephone_calls later ( strangely the line kept cutting off ) and 00_mins later ( and still counting ) i '_ve been told that jd_sports do not take complaints over the phone and that they have to be in writing for them to acknowledge it .
positive	haveing tried for almost a month on a similar site call the garden shop to be totally let_down twice and ill never go back garden for less will_definately get my custom again
negative	i was also told that the engineers word would be taken over mine even_though what he said was total rubbish !
negative	my advice : take every overall rating on this site with a pinch of salt .
negative	i have tried to phone you find out what has happened but despite your website giving 00 . 00 as your closing time for a friday your phone system is closed . also poor service .
neutral	clear website , efficient ordering_process and email_updates , but the royal_mail bit not so good :
negative	in my experience ccl are a very unprofessional company and no good at all for business purchasing .
neutral	ordering was simply , delivery was speedy and on time .
positive	clear , straightforward and quick .
neutral	however , this time the site seemed to freeze at the payment validation step and i had to call the 0000 number to purchase the desired items .
neutral	went to shop , chosen furniture not in stock .
negative	the £ 0 drop - off is just not needed , it should be similar to glagow .
neutral	much_cheaper to have your own goods in transit insurance .
negative	this came to light when i got a £_000 bill for gas in for one month .
negative	i paid and waited for the coin to arrive .
negative	after the refund was issued , i bought the same ssd again , but chose to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 for next_day shipping .
neutral	i '_m really looking_forward to trying all of the strengths on free offer and will certainly give them a fair try .
negative	i also called and spoke to [_name_] a week before cancellation - he apologised and told me the item would be sent the next_day - it wasn_'_t !
positive	it is also rather better quality than i had anticipated so will probably last for a few more skeleton outings .
positive	i wont mind admitting that i had a little cry .
neutral	yes !
negative	however , this time things were different .
negative	except 0_weeks after the ‘ go live ’ date , we still had no service .
neutral	nice tea but i paid £ 0 for 0st_class delivery and it took about 0_days to arrive .
neutral	but making calls over wifi / 0g was not a smooth ride .
positive	thankyou !
neutral	i can only hope valuable lessons have been learnt by o . f . l . s telephone cutomer relations team and that this dosent happen again .
neutral	customer_services did sort it out quite quickly
negative	refunds against this transaction
neutral	i ordered my product online , i paid using their secure_payment system and my products where delivered 0_days_later .
negative	overpriced , poor quality , helpful staff on a good day , products tend to be inferior compared to wickes . b_& q isn_'_t always reliable but homebase is the asda of diy_sheds .
positive	the products were exactly as_described , really good value in comparison to other pet_shops and very fast delivery .
neutral	order made 0 / 00 /_0000 it is now 00 / 00 /_0000
neutral	under normal working_days , i don_'_t think it would have been that long but then after_reading all the reviews , i '_m not sure !
negative	i will also be recommending that my employer , who have a 00_% deal with f0 , to stop their association with them .
positive	pharmacy_0u also offer a friendly advice service and they are always more than willing to offer their time and advice for free .
positive	i will be definatly using you again to purchase another large ogio bag for my pack packing trip in febuary .
negative	i would encourage people to avoid .
neutral	finally received and are lovely frames but disappointed i paid for something that said in stock and then had a prolonged wait .
positive	many_thanks ,
neutral	what more can you review ?
negative	would i spend anymore money with this company , no thanks .
positive	i put our trust on logo_depot and i am so pleased with the results .
negative	horrendous service , there is no other word for it .
negative	first order placed they forgot to deliver the grout , second order they forgot to deliver the tile spacers .
positive	i ordered some wood_stain on thursday_afternoon and it arrived in its promised time_slot the next_day .
negative	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
neutral	the day said item was delivered , the price had been reduced by £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i bought another one so they have done well from me so i am very concerned that i cannot talk to anyone to see where my refund in and that it is not forthcoming either .
negative	i was promised in this call that a ship was due to arrive on jayne 00rd with my products on board ready to be delivered within 0 - 0 days . on this basis , i went_ahead and placed the order but made it clear in the order the commitment that was made .
negative	we '_d already paid a direct_debit for three_weeks when the cleaner hadn_'_t cleaned anything , but maid0clean refused to refund us for that , or a payment for the next four_weeks .
positive	very easy to purchase items on website no_problems with anything
negative	the ordering process was very unclear since the website states they have stock and the managers in the company are unaware of stock_levels saying that they did not have it in stock at the time of purchase , but they had stock now so i would need to reorder again , he was unaware of how to cancel and order or even send anything out .
positive	thanks for making the experience personal .
neutral	the flowers were for my best friend of 00 years birthday and they failed to arrive on the date requested .
positive	lee was personable and responsive throughout .
neutral	i would use them again , but not before trying out other services .
negative	i then thought about it and if the driver was 0 hours late , for a 0 hour journey , he must have left his last job halfway into my time_slot .
positive	buying online , no problem , i order a couple of sizes then return the items that don_’_t fit , fantastic !
negative	i have asked our electrical trade head to have a look at your job and get back to me as soon as possible .
positive	it was very good service !
neutral	i assume unintentionally , sigma_sport '_s gbp / aud exchange_rate implicit in their aud prices is way off , so prices look really good .
positive	my husband is very happy with his new mower .
neutral	i decided to try a stain devil on it & it seems to have lifted , which has saved me all the bother of returning it !
neutral	however , you do need to be very careful with their promotions as i have found out when checking the site , today , to put in another order .
negative	komplett schlecht .
positive	quick delivery at a convenient time .
neutral	!
neutral	my eminem tickets still_haven_'_t arrived and everybody else seems to have got theirs !
neutral	the product arrived as ordered , very good quality .
neutral	following that my 0nd order i had been sent the wrong type of worktop , paod for next_day delivery which wasn_'_t the case .
neutral	i '_ve been with bt for quite a number of years and just have the constant niggling feelign that they ' re conning me .
negative	it is too easy to blame_royal_mail but i have sent and received many things before and never had a problem .
positive	keep_up the good work ,
positive	excellent stuff .
neutral	got what i wanted second time round .
neutral	the other site said they were paying me just a few_days_later - v . impressive .
positive	thank_you !
negative	the most basic customer_care is completely lacking . endless hours listening on the phone to how important our call is but still not bothering to answer it , failure to call back when they say they will , failure to do what they say they will when they do turn_up , failure to give reasonable time slots for deliveries and technical work ( t ' aint rocket_science that customers have to work to pay for this stuff !!
positive	if an item is not in stock they keep me updated about progress and delivery still is made within a few_days .
neutral	one one hand , some of their furniture ( table , lockers , couch ) is excellent .
neutral	but setting_foot in wythenshawe post_office , manchester and having committed the apparent mortal sin of putting a couple of staples in a bubblewrap envelope i certainly would never ever go in there again !
positive	the design was really pretty and we added her picture .
positive	it took a bit longer_than_expected to arrive ( due to adverse_weather_conditions that affected their suppliers ) but they kept me informed of the order status throughout .
negative	so yeah , thanks for stealing my £_00 simplygames .
positive	very impressed with delivery times .
negative	the leasholder only collects the ground rent and is completely disinterested in keeping the garage ' owners ' informed .
negative	they would not even give me the name and address of their ceo .
neutral	anyway great price and product is just want i wanted but i think i '_d go for home delivery next time
neutral	another subcontractor had to attend on 0 occasions too address the problem & remove with digging the drain rods in the collapsed pipe .
neutral	edit_: completely understand about your terms and conditions , after all i accepted them when i sent my goods to you .
positive	don_'_t worry though , colin / pat have a solution to that too .
positive	got my order delivered fast , no_problems
negative	total disappointment
negative	then ill have to wait 0_days for money to return to my account . come on sainsburys not good !!
positive	thank_you wicken_toys for excellent customer service .
positive	cannot_comment on condition of the boiler as the box has not yet been ordered .
positive	pat phoned me last night to say what a lovely surprise the flowers were and how they brought a little sunshine into a very difficult phase of her life .
neutral	not happy about that .
positive	i would recommend to a friend or relative with confidence .
negative	shelby :
negative	they asked me to wait 00 days before contacting them again , although by then father '_s day would '_ve passed .
negative	emma was mostly polite - and said they were too_busy to answuer the phone .
positive	would have no problem going back to them .
positive	offtek made choosing the right ram for my 0 home computers very simple , just by selecting the make & model of my computers on their website , they then tell you what your system already has & what upgrade is possible !
neutral	wig was rubbish
negative	if i could zero_stars but as i cannot they get one just for answering the phone ( even then badly )
neutral	! but rather ridiculous almost as an after thought , not quite the service i expected . had i known such late delivery i wouldnt have booked them . did use them once before and same happened although i thought it was because the first recipient lived in the middle of countryside . this was on outskirts of london .
positive	definitely will use this company again
neutral	prompt delivery is great but one of the products received was broken
positive	would use again very good service
negative	" yes , on your mobile .
negative	neither seems to be quality service .
negative	i ordered a flight bag on 0st dec_0000 . paid for fast delivery .
neutral	unfortunately i will avoid ordering from you in future .
negative	in the middle of all this , i was trying to tell them that this product wasn_'_t described properly and that they should change it .
negative	i accepted this .
positive	contacting us to agree a convenient time .
neutral	samsung note 0 has a s pen the only way to use it by removing the phone from a very nice cover but missing your company logo as on a co worker '_s s0 i will get another when i require 0
negative	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone else do the same .
positive	judith .
negative	you then have to purchase a full_tank of fuel £_00 on arrival at airport .
negative	obviously our order can '_t have been shipped when it said it was . mis_- communication .
positive	i have no_problems when i sell a phone with mazuma .
positive	easy to find what i wanted , even products i struggled to find elsewhere , reasonable_prices and very quick delivery
neutral	didn_'_t return as my boyfriend_loves it anyway
positive	a great sight , and i will definitely use this one again .
neutral	did not phone me back when promised .
negative	never , ever go with three .
positive	fast service .
neutral	die hrs seite ist mir zu unübersichtlich .
negative	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
positive	i am thrilled with my new_washing_machine .
positive	they received it , checked it and put the money in my bank the same day , and i had it cleared in my account 0 days_later .
neutral	the only problem i have is delivery take too long
negative	happy days , my dream guitar would be with me in two months .
neutral	as above did not say if would be back in stock so i could re order - so found someone_else to order from
neutral	we were told that two blocks per_person on average use should last four_weeks .
neutral	getting laser_treatment done has made a big_difference , not having to bother with glasses .
neutral	when the goods finally arrived at our first floor_flat , the delivery men informed my wife that they " didn_'_t do stairs ".
negative	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don_'_t really have much control of whats_happening !
neutral	i found what i wanted in a reasonable amount of time .
negative	just tested my download_speed its it is a whopping 0 . 00mbps .
neutral	however , report took over a week to be made available .
neutral	if you want a deluxe_bouquet that is worth the money , go to marks &_spencer !
positive	the money was in my account the very next_day after i ' d sent the phones .
neutral	howver on checking i was sold pedal at the lower price .
neutral	however , no email and i eventually emailed them to ask if there was a problem .
negative	after been passed from pillar to post and been told that they don_'_t have an account for me i have to ask
neutral	my photo_book felt stuffed_into a cardboard envelope which had obviously hadn_'_t been treated with care or attention resulting in bashes to the corners of my photo_book .
neutral	no explanation as to how an item ordered over the internet turned into another item on despatch .
neutral	unfortunately i fell ill and the insurers sent a form that applied only to a package holiday and tour_operator , not to separately booked segments .
neutral	they finally arrived and they were beautiful .
negative	0 week prior to event received a phone_call to advise tickets were not available - no apology .
neutral	on the plus_side . their 0000 thread bedding and their silk products are to die for !
negative	i bought 0 pcs together which was very fortunate because it enabled_me to compare them before turning anything on .
positive	showerdoc were extremely_helpful and knowledgable !
positive	upon our return , just a quick phone_call , picked_up within 00_minutes ( and that '_s only because of major road works outside the airport !)
negative	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website . ha !
negative	the systems and processes aren_'_t adequate for an online business .
negative	i ordered a made to measure_blind 00 days ago ; the money was taken promptly from my bank_account on the same date .
positive	happy customer :) and will definitely be ordering from you again .
neutral	i did not receive an_email or text to advise me when it had been dispatched or was due to be delivered so consequently i was out when they attempted delivery .
neutral	how long does a parcel take from lancashire !
neutral	i said i had nominated that post_office but there was no delivery for me either way .
positive	to do this holiday i had to book my kids with travel_republic and me and my wife with expedia .
neutral	now all of this was happening in the lead up to & immediately following christmas .
neutral	yes the item was signed for , by a workman who i do not know .
neutral	you get a tracking_number , that redirects you to the ddp website and where the tyres are , though the ddp website is abit confusing , as it dosent tell you how far away nor when your tyres will be delivered , ( not even aprroximatly ) .
neutral	the site '_s tricky to navigate if you don_'_t know what you ' re looking for , so it '_s best to browse somewhere_else and then come here with the exact product you want in mind .
negative	i think it is sloppy customer service to just blame_royal_mail .
neutral	i tried this , i requested that my item was delivered the next_day when i would be home ( and had a message_saying request was accepted ) but instead they delivered it anyway and left it with a neighbour .
neutral	then you settle_down to use a phone you dont like , so you have problems so you phone there 000 line only to find your talking to an overseas foriener who doesnt understand you or them you , so i couldnt wait for the contract to run out , so you give them a months notice in writing , only to find them contacting me several days after the letter was in there hands ( actually 0_weeks ) and find that the contract wont finish untill 00 days after you speak to there operater . what the hells all that about , what a con .
neutral	the prices were good and the parcel was well_wrapped .
positive	not tried product yet but seems to be just what i wanted good quality well_packaged .
negative	i will now tell them before they order to read the small_print .
neutral	i have been shopping at morrisons since they bought out safeway in 0000 .
negative	the flowers have now arrived and the recipient is pleased , but i would never shop with this company again because of the lack of customer_care .
negative	as you will understand , this time of year is always the busiest for retail_outlets .
neutral	too many_times ordered parts are of poor quality , dont fit , rusty , already broken .
positive	the only thing missing is tabs to connect to the luggage tie down points to stop it sliding about .
negative	perhaps the owner of the company has never_heard of the offence of " sending a malicious communication ".
positive	first time i have used this website and i will_definitely recommend .
positive	they sent me my pack out straight_away and it was a quick service .
neutral	after all , i ' d managed to secure the 00_% fare discount !
negative	i was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon .
positive	would i purchase from this supplier again ?
positive	top service , helpful staff , and would highly_recommend go_electrical
positive	thank_you rxsport
neutral	i hope they can make this order ' complete ' ( the event was 0_weeks_ago now .
positive	placed order at 0 in the evening .
negative	i repeatedly made calls from my 0 mobile to the chess head_office .
negative	poor all_round experience .
negative	according to vauxhall the engine only takes 0 litres .
neutral	thank_you paul wood
neutral	i also thought that at 0 working_days , the delivery is too slow .
negative	not only that but why dont yodel reply to your complaint emails either ?
negative	shop elsewhere .
positive	i would use this company again because of the fast free reliable delivery service and free_returns within 00 days but also for the no_quibble refund given .
negative	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
negative	i expected the order to arrive , but i did ' nt hear_anything .
negative	terrible service , tried to cancel my contract because of the terrible service , and extorsionate bills .
negative	just wanted the sop .
negative	they sent me tap that they had clearly opened and removed the fittings kit from to give to someone_else .
negative	pick_up watch 0 . put in jiffy_bag 0 . take to post_office 0 . go for lie down
positive	browsing the catalogue is risky - i usually find something i didn_'_t know i needed ,
positive	i was very nervous_about having it done but after my consultation , i was completely put at ease about the whole_procedure , especially finding out that i could be sedated for it - i don_'_t remember a thing about it , had no pain or discomfort afterwards , just 0 different_types of eye_drops .
positive	great product great price !
neutral	the advice he gave_me was wrong , which was clear just by looking at the rope light ( was told if i wanted to put a 0 wire controller on , to just cut the cable of the two wire rectifier and connect the cable . problem is the two wire rectifier has only two wires , and has two of the pins shorted out in the connector ( to connect to three wire rope light ), so this was never going to work ) i did what i thought in the first place and it worked_fine ( cut the heat shrink back , remove the rectifier and attached the new controller )
neutral	good response , but disappointed after ordering 0 , agreed to accept
positive	everything ok
negative	and i sugest others do the same for the sake of £_00 it isn_'_t worth the risk !
positive	regards
positive	samsung printed user instructions sufficiently comprehensive and clear .
neutral	no student support whatsoever , no clear tab on what homework is and when it is due .
positive	great job !
neutral	the item didn_'_t arrive in the specified time and also some excuse about their couriers however what is misleading is that they don_'_t have it in stock in their warehouse , the times are at the manufactures . a slight misdescription .
positive	i talked with freinds about your company and think , they will order something , too
neutral	grrrrrr .
negative	and a month later i '_m still_waiting for scs to respond with an offer of a replacement .
negative	made several purchases exactly as they say and my purchases dot get tracked .
negative	throughout this ridiculous ongoing ordeal i have not received a single unprompted call from anybody connected with the company .
negative	i bought a dress from debenhams over a week_ago , it was in their sale_section and it was just what i was looking for to wear at an_upcoming_wedding .
neutral	fortunately i texted them to make_sure that they had got them before the flowers disappeared .
negative	having_spoken to talk_talk about the fact that the resetting of the broadband line had not solved a connection problem we had with the modem provided by talk_talk some two years previously and which now was not able to be reset by the manufacturer but had to be reset by talk_talk as per the manufacturers instructions broadband , it was evident that the only solution was to leave talk_talk and try another_provider .
positive	i can '_t fault this company .
positive	first_class service , orders posted same day and nver any muck ups .
positive	i will use this company from now on .
positive	didn_'_t pay for next_day !!
positive	perfect all_round !
negative	they will automatically renew your domain_registration without sending any reminders and silently increase the price each time .
negative	simply the worst company i have ever come_across and would advise everyone to stay well clear .
negative	no reply to e_- mails
neutral	my last order didn_'_t come this way which was a little disappointing .
negative	it can take up to 0_weeks on occasion for the refund to be initiated due to current processes we have in place .
negative	i have used city_link regularly over the years , but never again after this experience .
positive	but amy was fantastic and i received my banner 0 days ago ( about 0 days from ordering ) and it exceeded my expectations with the quality of printing and construction .
negative	total_waste of time & money !!
negative	can i add that the swindon_store staff were sympathetic but their hands were tied by ofl procedures .
positive	much more convenient than traipsing down to the local bricks - and - mortar pharmacy , and cheaper too !
negative	he came_across mr mike norbury talking with another member off staff clearly slagging us off for having our shopping for nothing .
neutral	meats are great quality and have used a few_times but there was a missing item this time which was annoying .
positive	and i saved £_00 on the rrp of the lighting , which also came with the bulbs .
negative	but at_least i got my money back .
negative	yes i got tablets for my poor cat mac , he is very nervous and eating himself and his fur , but sadly the tablets i purchased form this site just didn_'_t work in fact since taking them he has almost stopped eating ,
positive	we would have no_hesitation in ordering from pack your bags again .
positive	this is the second time i have bought from them and i would definitely recommend to anyone .
negative	the ring was fine but i wore it out and it broke at the end of the night !
positive	got parcel next_day before 00pm !
positive	i needed a costume at short_notice .
neutral	spacious_villa in a great location , but for money expected greater levels of comfort , hard beds , noisy air_con and uncomfortable garden_furniture .
positive	i would use this company again .
neutral	i was advised that the tyre_pressures had been checked and were correct , on checking for my own peace of mind , i found the drivers_side tyre at 0 . 0 psi and the passengers side at 0 . 0 psi .
negative	how would that make you feel ?
neutral	quick refund on returned items which was fantastic .
negative	then no more company and no more brainwashing .
positive	a great service , and will buy again also recomend
negative	once i read the manual , i realised it should have come with a bioplug , for the cutting deck , also missed on the pdi .
positive	they came in a secure box and had a free return_label to use so i could return them along with a handy little brochure of the services available .
neutral	when i finally got through customer_care for assistance i got an_email with a temporary password , but the font was too small for mature customers .
negative	i used my neighbour ’_s computer to search your internet and this is what i found .
negative	ordered 0 items from this web_site ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
neutral	i had given my office address for delivery my order was split in 0 and one parcel got sent to my office and the other to my home .
neutral	great idea for a business but wait a long time for payment from most companies and have had a lot of problems with tracking ( whilst you can submit claims if they do not track automatically payments take ridiculous lengths of time ).
negative	i was sitting at home whole day waiting for engineer but no communication , nothing and when i checked my status of repair , it was saying repair complete .
positive	thank_you !
negative	that '_s why i booked it to be collected friday 00th and was promised a collection for then not monday the 00th .
negative	i said as a good will gesture we should be given the shopping for nothing as all the hassle k , kids going without tea , petrol money , phone_call and the sheer stress off the stress and frustration in which he smirked !!
positive	phone went cheque arrive quickly
positive	good fast service at a good price
negative	ebay is a market for lemons .
negative	the roaming rates are outrageous .
negative	can '_t get hold of them on their 0000 0000 numbers waste of time .
negative	join this campaign on [_link_]
negative	on the basis of that deal i tried to sell an htc phone .
positive	the memory i purchased was for a very old laptop !
positive	i ' d give them a full 00 out of 00 .
positive	plus i was kept_informed of progress at every_stage by email
neutral	the literature for lasik is slightly_misleading in that it goes on about how quick the surgery is and how you only need to come_back for one optional after care appointment .
neutral	no in process of waiting for a response after returning the incorrect glasses .
positive	a website that is easy to understand and use , good prices and very quick delivery .
positive	very clear interview .
negative	i can '_t understand how yodel in this day and age can '_t keep track of a parcel and where it is up to .
neutral	i think overall the prices and goods offered by homebase are pretty good , but having_shopped online then visited the store it seems like they are totally seperate entities . you would think a company this size would get their act_together and offer a unified front regardless of buying online or in shop .
negative	i then was trying to hold back going nuclear .
neutral	!
positive	amazing quick service !
neutral	you always take a chance with websites , but it is a shame the picture had not been updated .
negative	and a bit of customer service would have been nice .
positive	after being scammed a couple of weeks_ago by a similar company this has restored my faith .
negative	avoid at all costs , which will be passed on to you as the customer .
neutral	other than that it was fairly_straightforward and good value .
negative	too many competitors for you to do what you have done .
positive	if i ever had a minor_issue i just picked_up the phone and spoke to an actual real_life person_who answered my question there and then .
negative	imagine a delivery company that turns_up in your postcode , doesn_'_t ring your buzzer , doesn_'_t knock on your door , and then leaves without letting you know they were there .
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted and will avoid using citylink at all costs when it comes to personal use and will endeavour to get the company i work for to stop using them !
neutral	there are some fraying in the stitching around the cuffs .
neutral	it was a good quality costume , got delivered really quickly , good service but it didn_'_t fit
neutral	i find it very simple to order what i need from the website and do get contacted if the stock is out .
neutral	first time they have send a package back to chemistdirect , marking it as undeliverable !
positive	the keyboard arrived within_00hrs which was fine and was exactly_what i wanted .
negative	no apology , they just don_'_t care .
neutral	consequently by the time i arrived at the festival venue , hyde_park , i had missed the first 0 acts .
positive	the service is fast , efficient and the products are very well priced .
positive	i would definately_use them again as their after sales service is great .
neutral	the jewellery_making kit i saw on the website looked like just what i wanted , so i decided to make the trip in to manchester and have a look at the different_colours available .
negative	my cheque had been cashed .
negative	we waited for our internet_connection to be turned on for 0_months .
negative	i placed an order about 0_weeks_ago if not longer , for 0 products .
neutral	car audi ignored emails , unavailable on phone .
positive	really impressed with price , service , delivery and packaging definitely would use again and have recommended to friends
positive	the solution : custom - made ( a variation on their buttonholes at no extra_cost ), along with altering the colours of a corsage and the size of my bouquet .
positive	no_problems with ordering or delivery .
neutral	apart_from this issue , everything else was fine and i ' d use them again .
negative	:' o (
neutral	he was there for no more than 00 seconds - a bit rushed i felt !
neutral	i don_'_t think the original store should have sent a product out though that had a mark on it .
positive	very easy and trustworthy , highly_recomended
positive	excellent service frombeginning to end .
neutral	arrived in good time , good value for money .
negative	customer service failure number 0 !
neutral	the only_downer was that despite having been told the contrary , the car was not available for collection at the airport .
negative	no doubt they take out their frustration at their gross incompetence on the parcels in their care ?
negative	again going out of my way to provide the said documents , deleting the initial payment as requested by one manager , to then having to input the details for a third time .
negative	guess i won_'_t be calling anyone tonight then !
neutral	there was a very unpleasant musty smell .
negative	to cut a long_story_short , they allege two failed_attempts to deliver but no card was ever put through my letterbox .
positive	at first the uprights and beams seemed too flimsy , but once assembled , the racks are strong and stable .
neutral	if i could_find evidence to the contrary in the confirmation_email , let them know and they would investigate_further , needless to say , i could not find the email and so the matter had to be dropped .
positive	the call_centre staff at a o . com are the best at customer service they are professional and extremely_helpful an excellent company that i will now buy all my electrical goods from keep the good work up
positive	we shall be returning again .
positive	great value meat
neutral	købte et sd hukommelseskort og_modtog det uden_problemer .
neutral	orders are handled quickly and correctly .
negative	the winter_wheels in question were used on 00 occasions over the winter doing total of 00 complete rounds of golf by which time the rubber was coming away around the studs .
positive	i recently ordered the lowe_alpine womens tfx kibo nd00 rucksack from gear - zone .
negative	i then asked them to wait_until all products were in .
neutral	they never did .
negative	it is faulty and i would imagine this is why it was returned sometime in the past by the first owner .
negative	he also kept blaming parcelforce , but my problem was not with parcelforce being late just the fact i was waiting for something that was never going to arrive when i was told to expect it before 0pm .
positive	i went to glasses_direct for the price but came away amazed by their service .
neutral	monday_morning i received an email from scrappa asking when i gonna post my mobile .
negative	the uploading software was bad and hard to understand .

negative	i consider that they still owe me over_£_00 pounds (£_00 + less the £_00 ) and this matter has_been going back and forth over the months ; the last time i discussed this with someone there , the deputy manager didn_'_t even bother to come and talk to me but told his member of staff to tell me that i need to deal with this as it '_s nectar '_s fault and they need to give me my points back .
neutral	come on guys .

positive	also bought cream enamel coffee / tea / sugar canisters again at a good price . very retro . and look good too .
negative	i could go into driving hours and multi - drop rules ( assuming they don_'_t use a tachograph which would be more punitive to driving hours ).
negative	i notice the website for this company is ' under maintenance '.
neutral	however the interior is little tired and could do with some attention - it didn_'_t feel very luxurious and there was quite a lot of clutter in cupboards and drawers ( exactly_what we wanted to escape from on holiday !)
neutral	a clue .
neutral	the thing i think they need to change is the carasoul thing where it asks if you would like to meet so and so and if you both say yes it notifies you but then you have to pay to be able to see that persons profile !!
negative	hopeless service , no phone number , no response to e_- mails .
neutral	we received it yesterday and from the order through to delivery it was seamless .
negative	at my wits_end with talktalk . just called them as they promised to have this fixed today at the absolute latest only to be told that , because i had made a complaint , the department that could fix this had to stop working on it . unbelievable !

neutral	we had to wait 00_mins ( and drive around the block ) when we first
neutral	on return to the website it was still saying out of stock , but then we noticed that there were colour choices - we tried the next colour ( blue ) and low and behold we were in business .
negative	this was my third order over three years , and every one has_been mismanaged by this company enticing me back with a voucher_code that never works . their strange way of saying sorry !
positive	no_complaints just good

negative	a 00 year_old bloke .
neutral	i really like quidco but lately they seem to be taking a very long time with confirming and paying some of the cashback from certain companies which really needs to be sorted_out , other than that i recommend them to anyone , and do quite often .
negative	we are both speaking the same language .
neutral	no response what so ever and then the conversation was terminated by the ' customer_services ' rep without reply :(
negative	the customer service is incompetent and the website provides no alternative online_chat .

neutral	otherwise people will just ask to unsubscribe .
neutral	the birthday hamper left your at 00 . 00 ?
negative	i left email after email .
negative	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
negative	customer_support arrogant and unhelpful .
neutral	i lie , the fitter just looked at me .
neutral	also , we ' d had emails from mattress online telling us to inspect the mattress before accepting delivery too and the delivery guy was visibly annoyed when my wife wanted to take a moment or two to inspect the mattress before signing for it .
neutral	received only bits and pieces of items ordered at various dates .
neutral	the locations are a bit skewwiff - some postcodes generate a non_existent place .
neutral	the car had been ' cleaned ' but to a poor standard , particularly inside .
positive	we eventually , through a third_party , worked things out but the goods nearly went back .

negative	the glasses i ordered were not the correct_size for my face and thus i could not see properly with them , but the customer service representative refused to assist me with a full_refund , even after a full_refund had been guaranteed to me a day after i received the glasses and called the customer service for the first time , in order to be sure i returned them correctly .

neutral	have taken it apart and refitted ourselves so that we can turn on and get using the thing that we paid for fives weeks_ago .
neutral	my goods actually reached me three_days after they had been left with a neighbour - by which time i was unfairly beginning to have doubts_about your efficiency .

neutral	quality issue would appear to be with manufacturer so no fault with taps uk .
neutral	unfortunately , the apartment was cleaned only superficially to our appointment , nor was hair and dust everywhere .
neutral	the company did call me to inform_me of this , however , they claimed the website clearly_stated this .
negative	to be honest i could of got better in my local_supermarket for cheaper !!

neutral	on our return a phone message had been left at 0 . 00 advising us the delivery would be late but there was nothing left at our house to say whether the item had been left at our neighbour '_s house or returned to the depot .
neutral	found the gravy / sauce a bit thin ( especially in the pork and madeira product ).
negative	disgusting customer_care and awful service i would not recommend buying from this company due to mistakes and bad service i am £_00 out of pocket and i am still without a sink i will never buy from them again as my custom was truly not appreciated and £_00 was a shocking goodwil gesture for mistakes and stress

negative	transaction 0000000
neutral	i had to ring them and they bought the car to the airport about 00_minutes latter .
negative	after ten days i contacted them and was told it would be another 00 days .
negative	please don_'_t waste your time with envirofone , they might offer a few_quid more but you '_ll lucky to get it .
negative	i would suggest that any would be purchaser does a thorough_search around the internet and i would add further that they might inquire why so many reviews are taken down so quickly for spurious reasons .

neutral	after recently ordering flowers from serenata i found the website a little_confusing when i wanted to amend my order for a delivery time eg i was getting asked to ' press go button on right hand column ' this did not appear or i could not find it which led me to sending several e_mails as . this is the only way to contact you . i found this a little frustrating .
negative	dear mr lindsay

negative	i spoke to american_express who told me to beware and to rely only on reputable establishments such as fnac .
negative	the chair arrived and had a number of issues , primarily the fact that it was poorly_constructed and so the seat did not sit squarely on the frame ( as well as other issues regarding parts not fitting on correctly ) not wanting to risk the well - being of her customers using the chair , she called sports and leisure uk the same day and explained the issues .
negative	if only i had more time …
positive	easy website to use , quick transaction and definitely would use them again .
neutral	the order process was very quick and will be having my tyres_fitted tomorrow .
negative	i don_’_t mind delays as long as you are kept up to date and are reasonable to not have stock for 0_weeks and not contact the customer is unacceptable .

negative	why can they not check that they have the goods before they sell them ?
negative	i order from here but often find i am waiting for items and not notified if they are out of stock , you only find out later after items that are in stock are delivered .
positive	in addition to the price savings i got excellent service withe the items being delivered in just a couple of days .
positive	i received a very quick service , i was astonished when the delivery came through the following_day .

negative	eflorist took £_00 out of my bank_account , have never delivered any flowers and are ignoring all of my attempts to contact customer service .
negative	i needed the products for an event on sunday , and i feel that the company should make it clear on their website that " next - day delivery " and " saturday delivery " are in fact two different options .
positive	overall whilst i needed the products for a special application , fponline are now filed under the relevant heading and i know where to go in future
negative	by law you would have had to give me a full credit for returning the goods within the agreed time , so please do not make out i am receiving any special treatment for your shoddy listings in any way .
negative	turned_out to be someone from fitness first who sounded just like ali g ( rudeboy accent ?)
neutral	as do their parcel insuance rates .
negative	and the whole bunch had very few flowers and was bulked up with a huge_amount of leaves .

negative	when i finally received my package , i opened it to find an exposed make shift craft knife laying at the bottom of the box ( nice and dangerous !)
neutral	i thought " great , i should get it by friday or saturday at_least " and nothing could go_wrong right ?

positive	online transaction - easy no_problems
neutral	there are a number of companies i regularly use via_topcashback and every time i have to chase and chase for the payment , some of them i now choose to get avios points from instead of using topcashback , via the british_airways site which is a shame .
positive	i have never had to wait more than a few_days for my items to arrive .
negative	ok , the repairs have been dealt_with now , but should never have happened in the first place .

positive	amazing service considering i only ordered the flowers less_than 00_hours beforehand .
negative	decided to use mr auto and not oscaro . big_mistake their map for delivery details sent me about 00k the wrong way , fortunately where i stopped the shop knew where the collection site was , went there . no delivery . mailed auto and several day and more mails from me and they say 0 more week ( 0 total ) i have to go abroad in 0_weeks leaving a safe car for my partner . thanks for nothing auto am now going back in future to oscaro whose delivery is dead on , so cant deliver why trade ?

positive	many_thanks & keep_up the good service .
neutral	shame really as i would like to have dealt_with them again if only for the good price .
negative	photos were provided clearly showing the variation and they have refused to admit what seems to have been an error on their web_site .
positive	i ordered late on saturday ( about 0pm ) and needed the outfit quickly , it was shipped that day and arrived on the next working day . amazing , outfit was good quality and perfect for what we needed .
neutral	hate to say that the finished item was no way near as good as i ' d expected .

neutral	however the lady was very pleasant and the car was in reasonable condition for the cost .
negative	the staff on the whole were unaware of the systems in place for other departments to help , and the whole matter is being disputed still .

positive	the only company i will use .
neutral	hi
neutral	we selected a property and paid a deposit on - line - simples !
positive	i prefer torx screws , much more positive drive and a better appearance when slightly countersunk .
negative	especially as when you send the books or other items they will devalue them and you will not get a full value for your trade .
negative	i '_m not going to start yelling things like " do not buy from these_people " because i '_m not like that , and as i said i '_m not an unreasonable guy , but all i can give you is my honest_opinion about my experience with gameseek , and it was nothing short of abysmal .
neutral	luckily product was undamaged .

negative	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
negative	below is a letter i sent to the ceo of the company to which he has replied but not carried_out any of what he said he would do .
negative	they were always perfectly pleasant , but they ' re in business to provide a service ; and if they are unable to provide that service , the very least they should do is contact their customers to explain the difficulty and apologise .

neutral	my review may change when i have been with them for a while , will wait to see
neutral	good value for money .

negative	this isn_'_t my first purchase from watchfinder , the first didn_'_t go smoothly either , i won_'_t use them again , shortsighted approach by watchfinder as i generally spend more than £ 0000 on watches a year but none of it will be going to them after this .
positive	heard about these of a friend went online about 0 mins later both mine and the wife '_s iphones are insured great thanks
positive	they arrive quickly and are good quality .

positive	this was a quick efficient service and product as expected !

positive	was very happy with this .
positive	the price of the lenses was very good and working around their web - site was so easy .
neutral	none of the local take outs have joined up or even submitted their menu , but this is hardly just eats fault .
neutral	they are quick to take your money but don_'_t like giving it back .
positive	put my order in and got it the next_day .

positive	when i moved_house late last_year , i lost the " lock knob " from my projector and was amazed when the customer service representative actually knew what i was talking_about , and moreover sent me a new one within a few_days !
neutral	i cant_fault the car company ( triffity . they were great , car was brand_new , staff very nice etc ) but i felt like i had been ripped_off by this excess_insurance because i didnt get the insurance i wanted , and i had a very large_amount blocked on my credit_card which was the main_reason i wanted the extra insurance .
negative	no courier ever arrived and i had to book again , this time with city_link who came the following_morning at 00 : 00 and the parcel was delivered the next_morning before 0am .

neutral	my experience was some distance off this expected mark .
neutral	in future i will place my orders with a more nderstanding company .
positive	perfect easy to use . no_problems
positive	couldn_'_t ask for more .
positive	this company was very helpful in getting some very special downlighters for our victorian theatre .

negative	im_sorry this time i was not happy at all , and you could not sort it out .

negative	i even went to boots optician to check and confirm there is no n / z mark on that frame design and proposed to them that i can take a photo and show them .
neutral	the service was good , the website is easy to order from , the coat arrived quickly , but unfortunately there was a security_tag attached under the arm and trying to contact your customer service wasn_'_t easy as the phones do not get answered , this would have caused a major_issue had it not been that my son works in a clothes shop with the same style of tags and was able to take the coat into work and remove it for me .
negative	i can '_t get a refund because it '_s been used .
positive	i '_ve_used them on numerous_occassions and they have come_back to me very quickly when i '_ve had a query .
neutral	the cashback_rates are generally low and full of terms and conditions , and i can not find anything worth purchasing from the traders taking part in the scheme .

neutral	.
positive	great quality clothing , lots of different brands at good prices !

neutral	they felt more like a mans , as they were tight in the hips but loose around the waist .
negative	please stay clear !
neutral	the place was easy to find but when the employee gone out to deliver another car he asked me to stay outside the rental office in the hot sun to wait for him .
negative	avoid at all costs .

neutral	flew with easyjet again after a few_years break , i have to say they '_ve really upped their game . clean planes , friendly cabin_crew , etc . unless ryanair lowered my expectations from the aviation industry ?
negative	i wrote explicitly on the returns_form that i had been sent the wrong item and wanted the correct item sent to me .
neutral	sconsiglio l ' appartamento se siete in più di 0 persone e non avete molta confidenza : infatti il bagno ha l ' entrata nella camera da letto e chi dorme sul divano deve per forza passare da lì .
negative	i also put in orders with 0 other_companies on the same day and i got emails from them on the 00nd to say my goods have been dispatched but i have had no word from qvc .
negative	he went on to tell me that he now had to pay more for the parking .
neutral	as a direct result of choosing regus , i have lost business .
negative	no clear_indication on the website , or even a warning when i chose the option it just let_me pay for something i would never receive .
positive	i sent a few screen_shots from the dvr along with other observations , that night .
negative	today when i advised web - blinds that 0 items were missing , web - blinds checked with city_link and were advised that i had signed for all 00 items .
neutral	whilst the draper components ( pt 0 ) were well boxed and wrapped , pt 0 was less well_packaged .
neutral	it astounds me that safersigs can find the time to put up a you - tube vid extoling the virtues of the imist 0 but not show you how to fill the cart !
positive	i travel a lot and tend to vary my hostel / guest - house booking websites depending on the places fellow_travellers have recommended to me and whether they are advertised on a particular website .
neutral	other than that , food is well_packaged and 00_% of the time they had everything i ordered .
positive	i would deffinetly recommend this company to others and will certainly be using it again .
negative	we did not upgrade !
negative	0_weeks_later - email from tredz items will be in stock end of month !
neutral	pixmania overall - sometimes they ' re cheaper_than other_sites , but all the extras they try and add in automatically mean i avoid them otherwise .
neutral	i found the service to be fine but the costume was quite cheaply_made and didn_'_t reflect well in the cost .
positive	can '_t fault the service offered by first0magnets , easy website to use and very speedy delivery .
negative	i had to change my ticket due to an_emergency .
neutral	update
negative	0 - i applied for the santander mortgages !
neutral	in the end i rang up their customer_care who were not very helpful and who told me my watch wasn_'_t in stock and would be sent to me ' tomorrow '.
negative	call them & costs are 00p_per_minute .
positive	if i have one grumble , and it is a very small one , there was no communication between placing the order and the goods being dispatched on the wednesday .
neutral	first day ups made no attempt to deliver at all , then second day left at the front of my house where it could easily have been stolen .
neutral	luckily they let_me in but it could have been nasty .
positive	ordered one day .
neutral	!
neutral	the outer_wrapping of the parcel was damaged , whether this was due to rough treatment or bad wrapping on my part is unknown .
negative	they keep trying to brush it off like there is nothing they can do .
positive	icebreaker clothing is brilliant .
positive	the watch i purchased was a wedding present for my future wife and probably one the most nerve_racking purchases i '_ve made and terry made it a lot_easier .
positive	that suited my situation .
neutral	so two out three aspects were good .
neutral	whilst i am pleased with my purchase i would just like to say i '_m disappointed with
neutral	my first pair ordered some 0 - 0 years_ago have been excellent vallue and reliable .
negative	game was missing received only emty box , bord was not the one i looked online i pay for . board did not work and was badly_scratched . when i call shop from where was dispatched i heard them laughing when heard who i am , so i can only conclude it was done on purpuse . i was promised they will send city_link to collect . i waited from tuesday till friday_night , no collection .
negative	emailed them .
negative	its really is not good enough !
positive	the product looked exactly like the picture on the website .
negative	no money .
neutral	after booking , received several calls regarding additional_insurance including scare_stories_about driving in italy and the personal costs to me if involved in an accident .
negative	i agreed on 00 pounds for my phone .
negative	i will not order anything_else from you .
neutral	i may report this as mis selling .
neutral	however , the jacket does not give the appearance of being worth eighty odd_pounds , but i suppose everyone who now purchases nike equipment will have to make a substantial contribution to rory '_s 00 million .
negative	i left the store somewhat_disappointed .
negative	there seems to be no other way of registering a complaint about this company so i '_ll put it here on this site .
neutral	the car_seat box was heavily water_damaged to the point that the entire seat fell out of the box when the delivery guy moved it from the van to the front_door .
negative	there are companies out there who are a pleasure to deal with and deliver what they say they will .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received a reply , so i placed my order with tesco it was quicker and cheaper .
neutral	if you had better communication it would have been 0_stars .
negative	this is impossible as i was at work at the time and live_alone .
neutral	we had a good experience when ordering our invitations .
positive	the girls did my wedding_invites so pleased with them they were fun and quirky and would definatly recommend they provide sn excellent service snd so reasonably_priced !!
positive	i was kept_updated on the date and time of the order with emails and texts which was very reassuring .
positive	i have twice ordered the jointace fizz direct from vitabiotics when my local boots doesn_'_t have the stock , i have had a fast reliable service , it '_s a pain to go into_town to find boots don_'_t have it , and they often don_'_t , so i think in future i will stick to ordering from vitabiotics , it '_s no dearer and in the end works out cheaper not having to go into_town .
neutral	delivery was on time and order complete .
negative	it arrived after two_days but the ipod is corrupted and will not restore .
negative	have spent three hours on phone now and still not getting a refund .
neutral	i then phone the recipient and found that they had not been delivered at all .
negative	the quality of service virgin gives leaves an awful_lot to be desired , to date i have attempted to set_up a direct_debit with them five times to no_avail , the ' cannot care - less atitude ' is awful for such a big company . shame on you branson
negative	after checking , it turns_out this person is not one of the directors of the company .
positive	i ordered some rump_steaks & chicken_breast , the steaks were great , very tasty .
negative	i was not able to have the order of well over_£_000 . 00 because it was the last time i could guarantee being in to sign for the order which was for my 00th_birthday which was going to be difficult enough due to the passing away of my father earlier in the year !!!
positive	would reccommend this company
neutral	customer service is prompt .
neutral	this was not a very favourable experience .
negative	ordered a second_hand game at the same time from zoverstocked , was told despatched on the 0th which was a sunday so i thought that was a bit odd .
negative	having lost the receipt for a microwave we bought 0 months_ago i called the customer service line to see if it was possible to still get it replaced as the interior paint had peeled_off and was cracked .
positive	order was processed and took delivery within 00_hours , and this wasn_'_t a one off .
negative	still wanting the product , and not knowing better (!
negative	they were then taken to the local_depot and she was told she could not pick them up for 00_hours .
positive	each courier i have used has_been very professional and careful with the items they have collected or delivered and very importantly have been very pleasant to deal with with good communication_skills .
neutral	muppets .
negative	due to it being so late , i cancelled the order , knowing full well it hadn_'_t even been dispatched , this took another week to get a reply , i was told it was with the technical engineers and that they would phone me the next_day , my reply to this was of wonder ," why is it there ?
negative	i can '_t wait to change them over at renewal !!
negative	waste of time & money .
positive	i found the website friendly and helpful with clear_instructions on how to sell my mobile .
positive	very good price
positive	i would use company again was very good value for money really helpful when i phoned to place order as the site was playing up
negative	i tried on several different computers and got the same issue .
negative	as i said , last time !
negative	they also promised to text me one hour before delivery .
neutral	tyreshopper then told me that the courier had stuffed up and that the tyres would be stuck in their depot until tuesday .
positive	and it '_s not just whisky either ; they have a huge_range of spirits such as vodka , gin , brandy , absinthe , jenever . all at really good prices .
neutral	i do not agree that they have a policy of one having to pay over the odds for a full_tank of fuel , and you have to bring it back empty .
neutral	the trophies where great but like i said the sticker kept_falling out the middle .
neutral	nothing .
positive	truly_amazed need to get another one does help .
positive	combine that with an easy ordering_process and fast delivery and you '_ve got a winning_combination .
neutral	the delivery came on time , there was a crack on bosch drawer .
positive	i will_continue to use source wood
positive	what impressed us the most was that there was no pressure to order or make an instant decision ( which is not something we can say of the other_retailers we visited ).
neutral	i think it really is a case of you get what you pay for
neutral	i did actually email to cancel my order , as i ' d found one " in stock " elsewhere , only to find out it wasn_'_t in stock by the time i ' d had my order processed .
negative	promised i had bought the best seats , my girlfriend usually buys all our tickets so i am novice and believed viagogo .
positive	!

negative	ok ?
negative	not too much to ask , is it ?
negative	not happy at all with they way i was spoken to .
positive	now that '_s what i call swift service .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	cheers for all you help .
negative	chess was not the least bit interested in getting me up and running quickly .
neutral	although they give you a tracking_number etc it doesn_'_t state an expected delivery date and there isn_'_t any indication of how long delivery takes which means you are likely to miss delivery as you can '_t wait in the house all day everyday just_incase .
neutral	or is there double standards when it comes to selling used cars ?
negative	gave up in the end , and returned to the amazon website to try and arrange a collection and refund , a much_easier process than trying to find someone to talk to , but again no option shown for a part delivered product .
positive	ha ving had a set of procook scales for years ( these new ones were for a gift ) i know just how reliable , and pleasing their cookware is .
negative	not open again until after the bank_holiday , so i sent a ' where is my order ?'

negative	i booked for my tyres to be done on a specific day that was said to be available , a day i had taken off work to do so , after lots of messing_about and unreturned phone_calls i was told that my tyres hadn_'_t arrived , wasted my time as i had to arrange another day to have them done !
positive	timely updates via_email from ordering , payment , dispatch & delivery .
positive	this course was so easy to access and complete , everything is given to you and you don_'_t need to search for materials .

neutral	received a cast_iron pot which i was really pleased with until i inspected it and found the lid had a small manufacturing defect .
positive	i needed to order some more olay products .
negative	i finished the conversation without a solution and feeling frustrated .
negative	pretty sharp_practice think .
negative	though i would try this company out as i have a few numberplates on our other cars and just pick_up our offroader and decided to put one on it .
neutral	but the planning of it was so stressful .
positive	cannot_fault the service or delivery .
neutral	accommodation was not stag_doo friendly and showers were terrible !
neutral	ordered a pair of michelin_tyres on the website , arranged fitting , confirmed and printed out the receipt .
negative	i think that booking with late rooms is ok but i found that the price they give you is not much of a saving i paid £_000 for bb but their price would have been £_000 so saving £_00 not much of a saving not worth going through you .
negative	i ordered a pair of oakley_sunglasses that displayed they were in stock .
positive	all goods ordered were / are great but i ordered the wrong ones and when i phoned up to return the handles , the new ones were immediately despatched - brilliant service .
neutral	i sent e_- mail to general_manager about that and 0 / 0 other matters but received no reply to my inquiry or any apology .
positive	balber then offered it to me at the original price and explained what to do about the vat form .
negative	i had put £_00 pounds of fuel in my tank before dropping it off .
neutral	blackleaf are the only uk distributor for the product i was trying to buy .
neutral	other than that , payment was quick and price was fair ,
positive	the feedback info was excellent and the glasses arrived in just a few_days .
positive	i have used other_sites offering ' supposedly ' the same service , but believe me , they are not a patch on mazuma , as you very rarely get what they claim they will offer you prior to sending the ' phone - unlike mazuma .
positive	wanted the most bang for my buck , but was unsure_about graphic_card spec .
neutral	again very disappointed !!

positive	i have tried earlier with another us based well_known website , but they were never able to deliver it to europe somehow .
positive	i think they can give crc a run for their money .

negative	i would also like a refund but don_'_t want to go through the process of wasting my phone bill again staying on the phone for ages talking to a foreign call_centre who doesn_'_t understand what i '_m saying or can '_t actually decide_whether the flowers were delivered or not .
negative	it seems that they have had " website " problems and the person we spoke to was unable to resolve the pending payment issues and / or reorder for us leaving us to sort_out with our bank ourselves - just spent 00_minutes on the phone to barclays sorting_out - apparently this is a regular_occurrence with homebase !

neutral	this is efficient but the information ` i was given resulted_in extra unnecessary expense .
neutral	i live 00 miles from aberdeen which is far enough to travel for an_appointment that lasts less_than half an_hour .
negative	he never spoke directly to me and never took the time to try to explain / resolve the situation in a professional way .
negative	i have always used holiday_autos in the past , but since cartrawler have been involved , i believe you have little redress , the company clearly knows there are issues with dickmans , ( see dickmans rent a car , reviews on tripadvisor ).
positive	it is very rare for me to write such a glowing_report about any product i have purchased but glassesdirect really did stand out .
negative	we were greeted_by a bus load of unhappy passengers who had also been waiting an_hour to be picked_up .
positive	will recommend gladly
positive	the person on the phone was helpful and curteous .
positive	brilliant - i was always comfortable with the old frames so why_bother getting new ones ( i love recycling anyway !)
neutral	picture quality not great .
negative	every suggestion i have made ; get a smaller lorry ; subcontract it to a local carrier and even my offer to drive to where your delivery vehicle was and collect the appliance myself was met with a blank ' no '.
neutral	also black and white and i think it '_s too dark .
neutral	the item was well_packed with no marks on the box , so possibly just a small_glitch in the run up to christmas , will use jessops again though as this is the first issue i '_ve had .
positive	when you order and order the correct no of items / wowcher codes you want its brilliant .
neutral	to be fair to handtec , when i contacted them they informed me that the order was placed after 0pm cut_off point for next_day delivery .
neutral	second lot of shelves - not damaged but still some wrong_size .

positive	despatched quickly for next_day delivery

negative	00days and still no news on my phone .
positive	when contacting away0 to book our holiday , i had no idea that their service was going to be so tailored exactly to what we wanted .
neutral	also ordered a fan controller on a seperate order and this arrived in the given time but on closer_inspection i can see that the courier has manhandled the item and all the knobs were slightly_bent , again no reason to get it replaced as the item works and unless your really looking you wont see it .
neutral	i paid up .
positive	will definitely use again !
neutral	i thought the " bath buddy " for kiddies was a great idea , sadly it wouldnt stick on the bottom of the bath and kept deflating .
negative	if you are looking for a new mobile_phone i cannot emphasize how important it is for you to forget about even walking into an o0 store .
positive	reasonably_priced too .
neutral	problems started when in my order i picked a composite_door was given a price and guide date of 0_weeks this became 00 and many phone_calls later and a threat to cancel the order the door was indeed ready .
positive	delivered next_day .
negative	0 .
negative	their remedy for this was to go through each manifest individually to make_sure they went to the correct_address .
positive	no appointment needed at the opticians , which is great .
negative	phoned up for simple fridge hinge , no replies for 0 hours , then phoned to to clarify and they were emailing someone_else on totally different email address , very confused as to whether the part for my bosch_fridge was the correct_part despite all info given to them on the product number , so to this end went online to another company part , ordered within minutes and £_00 cheaper , so i would say avoid this company .
neutral	but they are getting 0_stars because the person_who was showing us the photos was nice .
neutral	their medication price is fine but because the prescription originates from spain the tablets have to be sent " overseas " viovet postal_charges are excessive .
positive	they seem to be holding up pretty well , are easy to clean and because they fit so well , they don_'_t let much dirt get under the carpet around the edges
neutral	well we got to the airport they forgot us and we didnt have no tranfers even no we paid for them after number of calls they arranged a taxi for us .
neutral	i still have not sourced the part , presumably 0st choice had the same experience .
neutral	in order to do that , i guess , you have to have visited at_least 00_% of all restaurants of that particular cuisine .
negative	last night i downloaded some software .
neutral	the goods themselves seem well built and of good quality .
negative	this is the third parcel in a row that '_s taken ages to deliver . yes i too have the message on the tracking service , card left , which is never in my door , then next_day unable to find . my last parcel of knitting wool from turkey was in my local_depot the very next_day from dispatch . and then took 0 working_days to get 00 miles up the road . customer_services are rude and unhelpful , and my local_depot never answers the phone or replies to messages left . i have made formal complaints on their forms but never_heard back . in future i will find out who the seller will use to deliver my parcel before i buy .
negative	?
positive	ec0000 .
positive	very easy to use site , great value and totally straightforward booking experience .
negative	a week_later no reply .
neutral	disappointed that your system cannot automatically determine whether a prescription is held by you or not .
neutral	need to change your post services rather_than let your customers down .
negative	in doing some_research i came_across proridermobility . com .
neutral	giood cover but the claim process seems a bit of a hassle , yet to complete it so i can '_t say how well it works in the long run .
positive	a ***
positive	received the prepaid_envelope the next_day and received the cheque next_day after sending my phone .
positive	the young_man was very helpful , he explained_everything to me if i didnt understand something he said it in more detail , it was as if he was appologizing to me for the incident .
positive	the receptionists were very helpful , handwritting me a receipt while their systems were down .
neutral	i was directed to a firm with the understanding that they would handle my case .
neutral	in summary , if you get an issue , remain calm and polite , work with them and give these_guys a chance ( or two ) and some time , to put things right .
positive	thank_you .
positive	would use again
negative	the service from rentalcars . com was terrible .
positive	within two_days i received a small box to place my used phone in with a postage paid bag to post it onto orange , it took two_days for them to email me with their final offer , once i accepted their offer it then only took two_days for payment to reach me .
neutral	not very impressed .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	i wanted to see if there was a more competitive company online for felimazole tablets for my pet cat .
neutral	customer service wise i would say excellent . the team we have behind has always acted professionally and fast . impeccable .
neutral	when i did this i was told that i should speak to my travel_agent :-( not very helpful to be sent round in circles when you are clearly upset about having to rearrange travel .
neutral	i discovered , when the plumber was fitting it that the mesh grid was the wrong shape , and i again received helpful treatment from amanda , who gave_me the astrocast telephone_number but she also told me that if i didn_'_t get anywhere with them to come_back to her .
negative	in the delivery instruction i asked for it to be left in our shed .
negative	dont_waste your money !
neutral	on the monday i rang kwik - fit to make arrangments for two tyres to be replaced and was told that they would be ready for fitting between 0 and 00 on the wednesday .

positive	the gloves are quite snug and the corset piece is elasticated at the back so no_messing_about with hook - and - eyes !
positive	the mattress we originally bought was very soft and did roll together .
positive	this anchor pump i bought was to replace an old anchor pump which didn_'_t owe me anything .
positive	they came in the post 0 days after i ordered them .

negative	the parcel was sent without my name on it so when it arrived at my company , nobody knew who it was for and it has now been lost .
neutral	booking long_stay parking in_advance is helpful and cheaper but having used the service several_times it is not without fault .
neutral	i ordered the door for my belling_cooker and it seems like the right door but now it won_'_t shut properly do not think this is down to the product but cannot be sure .
neutral	the customer service and internet_connection was collectively terrible .
neutral	i am a regular user and very happy with the actual online side of the site .
positive	the brand identity is wishy_washy and doesn_'_t stand up to the premium stock it sells .

negative	what about asda , sainsburys , three , talk mobile .
positive	this product is great . had massive problems with my arm - couldn_'_t even hold a cup of tea without pain . recieved the strap within a couple of days . used it straight_away and pain eased . 0 days_later played in a golf comp again kept the strap on and it worked a treat . would def reccomend

negative	now being a linux user , it is frustrating that tech companies don_'_t support the os so i enquired as to possible future support .
positive	great service .
negative	actually i couldn_'_t care less about the colour , but i can '_t believe the cheek .
negative	i was offered a 00_%_discount from a previous order this would not go through as code was not recognised .
neutral	however , the delivery times are poor .
negative	having paid up , stating i was not happy , an employee then took me to the car and in a whirlwind after making me sign an inspection form , made his exit .
neutral	it '_s out of stock and they were pretty unhelpful about suggesting alternatives , blaming restocking policies from the italian supplier .
positive	i posted my damaged ipad to another company first who changed their advertised offer and offered me £_00 .
neutral	my booking was not your system and caused some problems .
positive	if you want to buy some good protein supplements try the protein_works .
neutral	a good service and i dont see why you would have any_problems if you a making a minimal order but the bigger the order the bigger the chance of breakages just because of the way they are packaged .
neutral	they don_'_t have a contact email .
negative	groupon have no control over delivery
neutral	however as this was a gift there need to be a few other elemnts in place for this to work .

negative	customer service are very unhelpful , you cant speak to a human and have to email them .
neutral	i did get a apology and a good will gesture from the company .
neutral	everything is fine and the rates are decent enough when i deal by email or phone but since they have started_using the automatic online payment ( ipayfx ) i have not enjoyed the experience .
positive	very quick and very reliable service .
negative	on one hand they insist that kindles cannot be repaired and on the other insist that the tat they are trying to sell me is ' refurbished ' how does that work then
positive	fast delivery .
neutral	i have ordered this before from you in a smaller_size and there is no disputing the quality .
neutral	in particular , i chose this arrangement because it did not contain lilies or carnations , however the bouquet that was actually delivered contained both .
positive	mercury_av prices are always better_than those of the competition
neutral	not a bad_experience but i found it was just too expensive and also too costly to change booking details . i know that aferry have no control over border control but customs at dover are just as annoying as those terrible officers at heathrow . will use the eurostar or tunnel next time . a much more pleasurable / relaxing experience !!
negative	very poor if you ask me !
positive	the patience and competent knowledge displayed at all times by everyone who contacted me made the whole_experience thoroughly pleasant and stress_free .
neutral	so i had to keep checking it all the time .
neutral	only problem i had was turnover was usually between 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	they are scammers .
neutral	however they did not require a signature and left the goods visible in my front porc even_though i was in the house !
neutral	this is simply not good enough and is shoddy and unprofessional , yet at the same time i was happy with the quality of the items i ordered in the past .
neutral	competitive_pricing .
negative	i contacted them and they said they would investigate and let_me know .
positive	i cannot compliment this type of mattress enough and thank my frien very much for recommending them to me .
negative	described as oak , not even veneer !
positive	:-)
negative	i can not believe what i have just experienced .
negative	it '_s all been detailed on this forum already , so no need to reiterate what '_s already been said .
positive	seats were in the upper circle but had a good view , great atmosphere .
positive	i was extremely pleased with what i had in return and fully recommend the package to anyone .
negative	there was no need to do this as the house nextdoor where delivery was being made had a empty driveway and plenty of space .
negative	technician arrived late , causing me to miss meetings at work and confirmed that leather which had been marked could not be fixed , nor could the table be fixed .
negative	what a rubbish company , goods , cleanliness of stores , customer service all rubbish .
positive	the item was in good condition upon_arrival and there were no_problems .
negative	!

positive	fantastic will defiantly recommend .
neutral	it is with regret that i will not return to serenata :(

neutral	fitflop is a well recognised brand .
positive	she seemed happy with the bouquet , and it put a smile on her face .
negative	i have now been informed that the courier requires vat numbers and all the paperwork to be priced in euros and not british pounds .
negative	i said no again , refund my money or i will inform trading_standards .
positive	0_star !
negative	however , after driving away , i thought i had better check the level of oil .
negative	he still had the incorrect amount on his system and the call eventually ended in an argument and we had to hang up because he said we could not speak to a manager as one was not available in credit control - and that we would have to speak to one in customer service .
positive	we ordered a sack truck & it was delivered extremely quickly in very good protective_packaging .
negative	won_'_t be using this service again in a hurry
negative	the customer service staff available online , in the call_centre and in the store are all absolutely incompetent , have zero customer empathy and are more than happy to speak to you in a highly sarcastic and derogatory way .
negative	on tuesday .
neutral	when i ordered the item i didnt_realise it was just a chart that i was ordering .
positive	having said that have learnt several really quirky tips that have speeded_up my use of excel .
neutral	no friction should be the two star_rating .
positive	i would certainly recommend them and will no doubt be using their services again .
positive	confirmation of my order - updates on when the flowers were on their way and when they had been delivered .
neutral	three of the nine books i will have to throw_away , which made the order somewhat dearer_than i had hoped .
neutral	i again stayed home and again nothing delivered and no one contacted me and the website was updated at 0pm to say delivery on monday 0th between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
positive	:-))
negative	i ordered a go_kart from join0buy on 0th_september for £_000 . 00 with a delivery date of 00 to 00 days .

positive	i received very good email communication and the watch was delivered exactly as promised / described .
positive	good delivery time .
neutral	call from metro regarding profiles , apparently these prints would not be printed using this profile , which is not what it said on the site and it was admitted that i would not have known this - bad
positive	i always leave it to the last_minute to order charlie '_s pills but as usual you got them to me the next_day .
neutral	we have no idea if this is our delivery or not so hence no positive feed_back at he moment :( we will have to drive over at the weekend if possible !

neutral	the furniture is lovely and worth the wait .
neutral	not the chepest
negative	the gm wanted to speak to me which we did the next_day .
positive	ordering the product was easy from_start to finish .
positive	i have always had very good and reliable service from him .
neutral	the only_negative_point is that the bracelet was a bit too large , especially for women so that they didn_'_t dare to wear it .
neutral	the pictures are really good ( esp .
neutral	neither did in appreciate sitting on an almost full bus for 00_minutes as the bus only runs every 00_minutes .
neutral	please arrange for someone to be there throughout this time - as we cannot be more specific about the time of delivery .
neutral	we use your service every year and never had problems .
negative	their ' gesture of goodwill ' was on their terms in their time and had no regard for their customers needs , very , very disappointing customer service .
positive	it was perfect for what we wanted and we are delighted with it .
negative	later that day i received an_email_informing_me that the item was not in stock and i could order something_else or receive a refund which would take 0_days .
positive	they were delivered 0 working_days_later - what service !
neutral	however , the flowers themselves were a little disappointing .
negative	the whole system is flawed as the courier company consistently challenges negative_reviews hoping to get them removed , but never replies to customers on review sites . trustpilot are just helping them to hide negative_feedback
negative	when i got there the man on the back desk was extremely unhelpful and disinterested i asked to take a look at the laptop he got it out and then processed a buy back leaving me stood there for around 00_minutes .
neutral	i know thursday phone_calls cost £_00 . 00 , i '_ll have to wait to see how much saturday '_s calls came to .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my order to arrive .
neutral	i am a big_fan of ellis_brigham and have been a loyal_customer for many_years however i am a little disappointed in the time taken from placing an order to the home delivery .
positive	you can also select the " map_view ," which lets you see all of the hotels and b_& bs to chose from by location , so you know just where you '_ll be staying .
positive	really easy , instant_confirmation and so much_cheaper_than booking direct with ferry company .
neutral	movements !
positive	it '_s really good quality and good value for money .
neutral	it was £ 0 . 00 and turned_up 0 working_days after the date of purchase .
positive	just ordered online delivered to the door .
positive	i arrived at 0 . 00am and was on my way less_than 00_minutes later . staff were polite and friendly .
neutral	the blind looks_fab although still_waiting to be fitted .
negative	this review is not one that i would wish removed and i am happy to escalate this further should you persist in this request .
negative	very frustrating as i needed the item quickly .
positive	all issues were resolved , paid with my debit_card , goods came the following_day and i was informed of my delivery progress via my mobile and email .
neutral	the lady on the end of the phone was very grumpy with me that no - one was in to collect the parcel .
negative	however , there is no display of any transactions made on my account , just evidence of clicks to merchants .
positive	highly_recommended and am enjoying my beautifully speedy 0gb_ram on my laptop !
neutral	we had a real problem on the way back though with finding our ferry boarding point in the huge calais terminal .
neutral	this was a gift for my partner and he answered the door when it was delivered so saw the stickers on the box and ruined his_birthday suprise :(
positive	well_laid_out web_site and excellent service and great product - impressed will use again
negative	i asked why and he said this was for fuel in case i didn_’_t return it with fuel inside it .
negative	if you have days to waste waiting in for collections then this is the company for you .
neutral	made my selection but when i got there no one was ready and they had to search the store room for my goods ( twice !).
positive	i posted the phone the same day and the money was in my bank_account 00_hours_later .
neutral	then , as the website says that , when collecting in person , " please call us on + 00 ( 0 ) 0000 000000 to ensure goods are available and a member of staff will be present to assist you ", i did so on the day before i wanted to collect .
negative	i did receive a refund but only after i adamantly refused a replacement he would of received four days after valentines_day , would not recommend or use again !!
neutral	the process is complicated and unintiuitive , which is a shame because i think this site offers a better and nicer selection of invites than many of its larger rivals .
negative	rough !!
negative	the second part of your scam was the additional driver cover on the policy .
positive	a company you can_trust with a fast service .
negative	i would rate their service lower_than one star if i could .
positive	next_day delivery , delivery charges are low , customer service is unbeatable , prices are great , deals are great .
negative	00 days to deliver 0 product due to a " new system "?
negative	they don_'_t deserve to survive .
positive	would definately_use them again .
neutral	normally they are prompt and good at order picking .
negative	on balance - i think this company is best avoided
neutral	the person was polite but they appeared to be handling multiple conversations , as the delay between responses was noticeably slow .
negative	will be on the phone tomorrow .
negative	is first direct really a subsidiary of hsbc ?
negative	needless to say this matter is also now with the ombudsman .
negative	the website then said the courier would arrive that day between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
negative	i cannot open their web_site , probable have few sites .
negative	be really careful when something go '_s wrong as avenue 00 ,
negative	please be aware of the delivery time stated on product description page .
positive	wife happy ,
positive	i don_'_t know how long the parcel was there - i was away on hols .
positive	it was delivered by a very nice man who knocked at the door and wished me a good day .
neutral	they are described as near_mint - mint " straight from booster " , i '_ve purchased a few_times from them , i gave them the benefit of my doubt the first time , receiving some cards in a played condition ( peeling , creases ) , after the second time receiving bad condition cards i probably_won_'_t be ordering again .
neutral	ive said ok , as i was desperate for them .
neutral	although i can accept budget_airlines have to strip cost out of their operations to make profit , at_least easyjet show some civility and expertise in their dealings .
positive	very impressed .
negative	it was not made clear that the whole order of 00 plus items would be delayed .
neutral	i can understand that they may not want to buy dvd '_s that are not watched by many people , but informing_me of them not getting this ever / an eta for this would be a better way of managing expectations .
positive	00 out of 00 for service .
positive	payment process good if a little lengthy .
negative	this is why payment is taken by the hotel directly upon check - in / out .
negative	.
positive	the positive is that all the parts fitted_perfectly to a seamless finish .
positive	there was a very big selection for me to chose from and the site made it easy to view the different_styles and colours .

positive	very quick delivery , excellent quality - i really like it , and best of all . free_p_&_p :-))
positive	order was delivered the next_day , brilliant product as_described ,,,,, would definitely use again !

positive	i would recommend them to anyone .
neutral	i was disappointed .
neutral	i had to clean underneath the cooker_hood before a meal could be made .
positive	huge_range and had the glasses i wanted a third less then on the high_street .
neutral	it does work , though , so i got the money !
negative	and then i sent mails no reply from them .
positive	amazing service at the cheapest rates , and with the fast delivery what more can you ask for !
neutral	the costumes were ok . quality a left a bit to be desired as did the actual manufacture quality .
negative	not ' up to ' 00 days but the full 00 days .
neutral	i found one that looked great with virgin that was a 00 month locked in service where you gained good interest and you could add as much as you wanted but not removed it which is exactly_what i needed .
neutral	in big comparison , i ordered an ipad_air smart case £_00 from a different store as the co op did not have it , this was delivered today .
neutral	i ordered 0 identical bookcases from paperstone .
neutral	i phoned kershaws back to let them know what a poor service the delivery company were giving , the guy at kershaws was understanding and polite and said they would try to improve their service .
neutral	i bought some crystal skull_vodka from 00dover which was a good price with next_day delivery which was the main draw as it was a present and i had shopped_around for a good price .
negative	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
negative	well it would be if it wasnt such a drag to watch something online .
positive	this he did an suggested an epson 000 , a new model , at £_00 .
neutral	the stuff purchased £ 0000 was received but 0 items were missed off ( bottle trap and chain waste link ).
neutral	unfortunately actual shops carrying camera / video equipment are thin on the ground these days ( in the uk ) so can '_t see the items you are looking to get and compare .
positive	i sourced so many genuine gibson parts from these_guys as i was putting a les_paul together replacing hardware and pickups as new .
neutral	i chased up the final item six_weeks_later and received a quick and friendly apology and assurance it was still on order and would be delivered soon .
neutral	good website for information about products particularly_liked the video .
negative	however , when we tried to assemble the mirrors they were discovered to be faulty .
positive	in summary would use both blackcircles and broadbridge heath garage again the in future without_question and have already_recommended to friends and colleagues .

negative	i was horrified to discover at approximately 0 . 00_pm on saturday_night that at 0 . 00_pm i was sent an_email to say they couldn_'_t deliver the mother '_s day basket until tuesday .

negative	!
neutral	if you can or are available to contact them by phone , problems can be solved quickly .
positive	they offer a really quick delivery and their prices on vinyl and equipment are very resonable .
negative	your fifth paragraph is again wrong , there was never confusion on my part , please do not insult me , i went in and out of the site before i purchased the goods , i took advise before purchasing as the listing seemed too good to be true , but it was what it was .
positive	my disc drive laser was replaced in 00_minutes , at £_00 . 00 ( half the price of most other quotes ) with a 0 month_warranty as advertised .
positive	the pricing was more than competative and the service was exceptional , i had request if they could meet a dead line of a weeks delivery , but they beat that hands_down with the sinage arriving next_day !
negative	i asked for the delivery date and then nothing happened .
neutral	two years_ago i would have given them 0_stars without_hesitation .
negative	the dresses on their website are cheap imitations .
negative	dreadful company to deal with .
neutral	the only saving_grace was the pool which was spotless and really well looked after .
negative	its an_absolute_disgrace for this reason i will never use that courier or your company again unless you use a different courier .
neutral	was informed by email that my order had been dispatched the day i placed it so was in receipt of the goods the following_day which was great but was disappointed to find that they sent me a different flavour of dog_food to what i ordered .

neutral	cheaper price online than the girl gave_me

positive	i would have no problem buying from these again .
positive	would use them agajn
negative	!
negative	i cannot_believe this company is still running !
positive	quality and service second to none prices can '_t be_beaten they are a must use
neutral	the booking was for collect from pietermaritzburg and return at johannesburg a journey of 000ish km .
negative	did not feel i was listened to .
neutral	my friend who the flowers was sent to said that they was dying
neutral	confused because i have managed to get it from somewhere_else without_any problem .

neutral	we were picked_up at 0 . 00am and arrived at the airport just before 0 . 00am !
positive	would use them again in the future
neutral	even if they didn_'_t want the kit a reply at_least would have been courteous .
negative	i can '_t express how bad the customer service was with just the same generic email being sent to me each week and not telling_me anything .
positive	i was very grateful for the speedy and expert service .
negative	and i still wait for answer about my order witch was missing my creatine .:(
neutral	no where on the site advised next_day and the only part was 0 - 00 days which is what i was going with .
positive	hassle_free service - just what we wanted !
negative	it is only when i was chasing up deliver on the friday_afternoon that i saw this on the help pages .
negative	i am very disapointed in the service .
neutral	i was not happy at the delay , but i am happy that someone out there understands customer service while also not just being a wet drip and saying yes to customers for no reason .
positive	having had a mixed experience with the various service providers i was a little_apprehensive when i first contacted age_partnership .
negative	had an awful 0 month saga with this company .
neutral	on a plus note , when i spoke to wineware they sent replacements .

positive	nothing more to say .
negative	hiring a ' man with a van ' is how the business is run .
positive	great service from_start to finish with good communication_throughout .
positive	the cheapest site !
neutral	for their single cards however , hit and miss .
positive	simple easy to use website fast delivery and would definitely recommend using .
negative	just had an extremely arrogant chap call me up from chess to tell me that i owe them money and that because i have ignored all their efforts to contact me over this debt his department the escalated debt department were now dealing_with the matter .
neutral	while most of their products are good their customer service leaves a lot to be desired in my experience .
positive	when discussing the degree of wear during my repeat order , the salesperson immediately ordered replacement seats .

neutral	after that the process worked pretty well up to the point where payment was taken .
positive	have saved them in my favourites on my tablet and will definitely be using them again !
negative	embarrassing !
negative	you would as many have done knock on the door or bay_window driving the dogs potty .
neutral	a frustration whilst on holiday was that i could not check my account balance from my android tab in the hotel as it requires flash_player ( not supported on android ). this was a bit of a pain as i had no idea how much credit i had left on my card !

negative	avoid this chain at all costs
neutral	flowers were ok but not as good as website and didn_'_t last that long before they started to die
neutral	i think if closer attention had been made to the design of the draw runners and the quality and material of the fixings then this product and the service provided by made , com would be excellent .
negative	the information supplied gives a surname of who signed for the parcel , but funnily_enough it is neither my surname , nor my partners , or actually any of my neighbours either .
neutral	very disappointed , these flowers were ordered for a collegue who was retiring .

neutral	.
neutral	it would be nice if i could get a positive response .
negative	i only wish i could upload the picture i chosen compared to the one recieved
neutral	it often pays to shop around rather_than using quidco - it '_s not unusual to find someone selling something cheaper_than a quidco retailer , even after taking the cashback into account .
negative	how bad they are !
positive	i was also able to fill in the forms while he talked_me through the questions over the phone , which was reassuring .
neutral	that said i would still shop with this site as they are not responsible for the pressing .
neutral	i know the more you buy the cheaper it becomes but the quantities necessary are more than we need at any one time .
positive	excellent !
positive	very efficient in terms of taking the order , price and delivery .
neutral	the second time the ffx decided in their wisdom to hold back dispatching a next_day delivery item on a £_000 fein because they were waiting for a 000ml_bottle of stain to come into stock ?
positive	really glad that i did service was quick and perfect , no_issues with product upon delivery and it turned_out being exactly how i hoped .
neutral	to be more precise - very happy with the quality of the frames and the quality of the workmanship .
neutral	the problems of getting it here are the only thing that sour the milk .
negative	amazon have obviously refunded my payment .
neutral	cleaning with a filthy mop obviously hadn_'_t helped . but that was down to the cleaners !
positive	great service and good prices
neutral	tried several_times and then happened to scroll_down to the bottom of the page and found several offers but none taking into account the weight of my parcel .
positive	they phoned up , informed me of the delay and suggested an_alternate product and matched the price .
positive	delivery far quicker_than i expected .
neutral	other than that good prices and fast delivery .
positive	!
neutral	then had to wait about 00_mins for the van .

negative	how do they sleep at night ?
neutral	site stated dispatched in 00hrs and items were in stock ?
negative	very very unhappy customer .
negative	it was only upon doing a customer survey that i found out the extent of what has_been going on !
negative	other beauty deals reasonable but staff moan_about how badly groupon treats them so you end up feeling bad for them and giving a huge tip so no discount there then , restaurants - hit & miss , usually struggling businesses trying to drum up business and when you get your meal you know why .
negative	they claim the account is a business account , even_though it is abundantly clear this was a personal purchase , and will not back down .

negative	films i returned being sent straight back to me and probably the world '_s most confusing web_site that i can no_longer be_bothered to navigate .
negative	have made numerous_attempts to contact viagogo but receive nothing but generic responses which are of no use to me .
negative	no helpful support when reported just brisk dismissal .
positive	very fast and reliable service .

positive	trainers arrived before expected .
positive	would not_hesitate to recommend them and will also definitely not be shopping elsewhere when the need_arises .
positive	what more could i ask .

neutral	i would choose not to use sky if i could , but it is the best product available if you have no cable access . when anything_goes_wrong it is a nightmare , be prepared to spend evey waking hour on the phone for at_least a week , and then get an visit from a rude and incompetant engineer .
neutral	however a small item ( dog training treats ) on my last order proved to have been charged with a fifty percent hick (£ 0 . 00 instead of package printed £ 0 price ) on the printed price on the package .
neutral	many emails back and forth with serenata explaining the situation , but serenata said they would not help by contacting the property_owner .

negative	money taken .
negative	. we ' re going around in circles at this point !
positive	bcs gives you a helpful tool which shows how much room your items will take , allowing you to know exactly how much you can get into one box without raising the shipping_costs .
neutral	i like the website for the price but quality is poor .
neutral	- over the phone : stupid customer service who don_'_t listen to what you ask for .

negative	i booked a few_days in advance but the staff kept me waiting at the office while they did address checks , etc .
neutral	this was ridiculous service .
negative	the service is disgusting as i was told i would receive a call this morning guess_what nothing .
positive	unfortunately as i wasn_'_t buying them for myself i had to exchange them for bigger_size - and this is only fault of myself - nothing to do with company service .
negative	lady helpful but just keeps saying " we ' re sorry you didnt like your frames " overall this is truely one of the worst online retail experiences ever .
negative	i requested the phone was returned .
negative	they didn_'_t even bother to reply my messages .
neutral	agony doesn_'_t quite cover it .
negative	don_'_t ever purchase anything from this shop and expect them to get it right first time , if at all .

negative	if i pay for it then i should get it so will go to bank and get it my money back that way
neutral	it did not fit well into my original veglia speedo because it did not replicate the original design .
negative	the flowers received to the flowers ordered where two completely separate things !

negative	we then had a call from hiway ( the delivery company ) saying the van had broken down and that it would be delivered on sunday instead .
neutral	the deposit was in my account within the 0 hours specified , however they take the money back at a not so good time and then when it says you can deposit another 000_pound it doesn_'_t let you add anything which is not very good if you specify an amount that a customer can borrow they should be able to have that amount not say available amount then when u process it not let you take anything out .
negative	so they have not been despached as you say they have been or they have gone_missing , irrespectively you still owe me two bottles of bundy .
negative	attempts 0 - 0 i gave up after 00_mins each .
positive	yet as serious as old cognac .
neutral	you only know how good a company is when things go_wrong .
neutral	issue was really between scrappa and post_office .
negative	you have to give yodel 00_hours notice so that they can ' prepare ' your parcel ready for you ( make_sure it '_s looking it '_s best and what have you , spruce it up ready for it '_s big day , maybe give it a spray with some pleasing scent and tie a nice new red ribbon around it '_s middle ?).

negative	when i got home and managed to phone them they told me i should '_ve phoned to switch on roaming before i left even_though it worked last time i was abroad .
positive	prices good would use them again .
neutral	i had to wait over 0_weeks for their delivery .
positive	but better to be early than late .
negative	after 0_weeks , i contacted them to ask when i could expect delivery , only to be told that they couldn_'_t deliver at all and they ' d have to cancel the order !
neutral	would be great to see what you would actually be charged given you had already entered number of guests when searching .
negative	i previously recommended this site to friends , but on this evidence base , perhaps i should be telling them to avoid instead .
neutral	once altered the second printing was fine and i ordered two copies of each book , resulting in nine books in total .
neutral	on measuring i discovered the bracelet was actually only 00cm long .
negative	i emailled mega_fancy_dress who asked me to phone them .
neutral	the guys were great who installed the machine .
negative	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer_care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
neutral	i have used diet_chef on and off for a few_years with reasonably good results . as it is fairly expensive , i was pleased to buy at a reduced_rate through_groupon .
negative	it is not i repeat not worth the effort of putting the books on for trade and be let_down .
positive	as soon as they were delivered i was bombarded with messages from my friend who said she loved them and they were delivered nice and early ( noon ) on a saturday .
positive	the service was good all_round and i would recommend toolstop .
negative	why are these things so difficult .
neutral	good service and delivery although i ordered 0 costumes and one had a hole in it and 0 had to have the sleeves sewn on :(
neutral	another negative is that prices can be a bit mean , even lower_than music_magpie sometimes and that '_s saying something .
negative	i feel that this is just plain dishonest - why can '_t rentalcars . com sort this out , so that there is one charge , inclusive of all insurance ?
neutral	ha
neutral	six days_later i got an e_mail_stating they couldn_'_t send the medicine as they were waiting for a prescription .
neutral	0 oaps asked for a twin_room and was given bunk_beds . struggled o yeh even worse trying to get down .
neutral	i can only_assume the rough_handling by the courier ( none of them handle parcels with care ) had caused the bottom tray of 0kg_chicken_breast to split and leak its liquid content .
positive	even_though it was around the christmas_period delivery was fast and efficient .
negative	i did & was told that as i ' d paid them via_paypal and the item was out of stock , they ' d email me when it was in stock & notify_me of the delivery day then .
negative	i rang up and they said that service is only for the first 00 days and go to a store .
positive	- superfast service .
positive	delivered in makers packing on a pallet .
neutral	but they must be right i suppose .
neutral	this was done on line easily , but on my arrival it appeared that the information had not been updated on the paperwork held by the person_who came to meet us .
neutral	however , i ordered the ' 00st_birthday silver balloons and helium gas package ' which was supposed to include " 00 of 00_inch silver latex balloons " - the first one exploded as we tried to fill to 00 " and on trying a couple more , realised the balloons included didn_'_t even inflate to 0 " - very disappointed and as these were being inflated on the night of the 00st_birthday it was too late to sort and we had to use these which looked stupid next to the printed 00 ' balloons we had .
positive	best delivery service ever , next_day delivery , plus a 0hour time_slot
positive	because i know i '_ll get my stuff and superfast .
neutral	the ordering_process was easy and the office staff very helpful .
neutral	simple to use site although could of got a fit date 0 days earlier from tyre_shopper at the same branch .
positive	far cheaper and more convenient than going to an optician !!!
positive	richard
positive	great prices .
negative	ordered two leather_sofas from them , was told they were in stock at the point of ordering .
neutral	this needs to be reviewed please to make them safe to use .
neutral	it is a very nice worktop which was well_protected when arrived .
positive	great service .
neutral	my daughter has just informed me that the wrong_size was sent so the item will be sent back
neutral	do they ever sell anything at the list price ?
negative	not to bad you may think , however we were issued with a telephone_number to call 00_hours before departure to arrange pick_up .
positive	i received a couple of emails and a phone_call to confirm my order which was very reassuring .
neutral	goods arrived on time .
positive	in fact it offered better protection than some other more_expensive insurances .
positive	fast email_exchanges from steve , it was done within the hour .
negative	0pm - no flowers .
neutral	selected two of all items in the number boxes , when i finished the transaction it was only for one tyre so i emailed customer_services this morning .
neutral	put the statistics for the models in the pictures on the website as well as the size of the clothing they are wearing .
negative	customer_relations team
negative	most of the products are not in stock they have to order them and then send them out .
positive	would use this company again without_hesitation .
negative	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
negative	i emailed back and they said as they couldn_'_t prove that it wasn_'_t there before they weren_'_t held liable .
neutral	i have no concerns about the products themselves or the speed of delivery which were both good .
neutral	the cabin , restaurants , bars and other facilities on the ship are excellent and there is everything that we need .
negative	he kept telling_me that i had made my mind up any way and what was the point of talking to any body else .
neutral	the delivery of money was on time and the website was clear up to a point .
neutral	this costume was awesome !
positive	i recommend this company to all .
negative	after some investigation i realise that trustpilot is nothing but a scam , a place where companies can build the kind of reputation they want to project , adding countless good reviews , and quashing any less_than favourable .
neutral	i bought a fridge from ao and , being extremely impressed with the price , buying experience and delivery service , was all - too - ready to recommend ao to as many other people as possible .
negative	posted specs guaranteed delivery .
positive	attention to detail and to customer_care from the start to the finish is excellent .
neutral	if you have a man in the house wearing size eight or above shoes i wouldn_'_t recommend this cupboard even_though it looked quite nice when eventually built .
neutral	was the parcel even delivered or did the guy just think " screw it they don_'_t really need this ".
neutral	!
negative	i can only_assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves . absolutely useless !
positive	replacement part ordered easily on line - love the fact you can check the appliance model_number - both reasonably_priced and delivered within the time_scale given .
negative	sent phone .
positive	i used this place for the first time last_week .
negative	note that you have no form of redress or compensation for cancellation - all you can do is leave " negative_feedback " and ask for your initial deposit to be returned .
negative	i would never go back to virgin and advise others to be very wary of this poorly run company .
neutral	having to pay to return the faulty item to france is not acceptable .
positive	have tried numerous other_websites and this is by far the best .
negative	avoid as if things go_wrong theydon '_t want to know .
positive	got what i wanted at the best price with free delivery within 00_hours !
positive	it was all explained to me over the phone then always followed up in writing .
neutral	there may have been a change since it was written .
neutral	we ordered the flowers and got next_day delivery . great . but we ' re delivered to 00 not 00 !
negative	i also made further calls to try and make contact - and i ' caught ' their office worker who told me her name but it escapes me .
neutral	everything was easy & very straightforward , but the payment system needs serious improvements .
negative	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i '_d be emailed back .
positive	all_round great service .
positive	thank_you , what else needs to be said .
positive	delivery was next_day as promised and the product is top_notch .
neutral	ebookers is very good , especially if , like us you like to do round trips .
positive	was after a set of speakers to run from my pc .
negative	how else was i supposed to use it ?
negative	i said there is and its me , so let_me speak to the supervisor silence .
positive	i live in spain and order my diabetes test_strips from pharmacy0u , also the stuff i need for my dog like frontline and drontal .
positive	with the paint options and milage i wanted etc it was 000 per_month with nationwide_vehicle contracts , and the nearest the dealer , after a lot of sweating and fumbling , could get to it was 000 per_month !!!!
positive	a cold day but worth the money and the time .
positive	the pick_up & drop_off point for the vehicle was only 0 or 0 mins_walk_away from the airport_terminal which was a welcome thought .
positive	i received the tag the very next_morning , with the omega following on the day after .
neutral	talk_talk get a lot of flak but other than changing my contract without telling_me i have found their service ok
neutral	well , the product ( now we have the correct one ) looks good but ;
neutral	there were so many knots that left very little wood to act as support in fact the door end and one of the sides had spars broken through the knots .
positive	delivered as ordered .
neutral	they eventually reinstated me and told me to report spams to them which i tried doing and they came back with some very poor support .
negative	i ordered a go pro camera with you for £_000 on 00rd august and promised delivery within 00 days .
neutral	i would have expected a charge for posting and such , but to pay £_000 extra is a joke .
negative	.
negative	i would advise anyone who is thinking of becoming a chess customer to think very carefully .
neutral	when contacted , they said they '_ll get back to me in 0 business days .
negative	it looked as if the whole consignment had been rejected , left_outside in shame and reclaimed .
neutral	the roses were fine but the stocks were damaged and dying on arrival .
neutral	looks as though aspinal must be desperate to generate sales .
neutral	loads of company '_s leave hidden in recycle boxes or over side gates .
neutral	i found it a great easy to use site , however , it was very frustrating to keep being asked to phone a number , when you were trying to shop on the internet .
negative	we do consider ourselves to be professional , honest and committed ; traits which are generally not associated with the industry we represent .
neutral	other items had to be sourced from their shops rather_than from central stock , so there was a delay before those were sent .
neutral	com uma encomenda feita ainda durante a manhã de 0 de maio paga com cartão de crédito , só foi expedida no dia seguinte ( 0 ) e recebi a encomenda na morada indicada no dia 00 .
neutral	the villa was in a good location for shops and restaurants , the beach and the town square of puerta pollensa .
positive	not only is there a great selection but the prices are excellent too .
negative	items frequently missing but charged
negative	0 , why get me angry then try arugeing with me down the phone .
neutral	the prescription was stated on each one but there was no information as to how to use / care for the lenses .
negative	who don_'_t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
negative	i then rang their general_manager , a man called [_name ].
positive	have all been seamless and the communication is good so you know exactly when your delivery will arrive .
positive	instructions were a little_unclear , but final assembly proved i had interpreted them correctly after all .
neutral	if i had known the item was out of stock , i wouldn_'_t have ordered it .
positive	!
positive	love the colour selection , and fast shipping !
negative	on the plus_side , when i did contact them to complain , i got a quick response and fill refund .
negative	the money has_been taken from my account which i think is disgraceful .
negative	incompetent engineers ; lies from the help - centre ; money taken to which they are not entitled .
negative	later on , i found a list of depot addresses and phone numbers ( from a complaints website , listed by a distressed customer ).
neutral	the blind looks beautiful but the blind mechanism comes across as awkward ( being behind the blind itself ) and is clumsy to lift and drop .
positive	i have purchased a number of watches from various companies in the last few_years but i have to say terry at watchfinder has_been great .
positive	thank_you again
neutral	dec . and obviously i do not have it yet .
positive	google searched this jacket and found it £_00 . 00 cheaper_than anyone_else what more
neutral	will use again but so easily could have been a perfect experience .
neutral	should be next_day delivery
positive	the free standard delivery on a £_00 order arrived in 0 days with a 0 hour delivery slot , spot on .
neutral	what is the point of my giving you and a phone number if nobody uses it ?
negative	it was missing the lead to charge it too so i rang about that and they said i couldn_'_t get my lead back but he would send a standard one mine was an extra long pink lead !!!
negative	i am about to issue a summons to the small_claims court .
positive	as i left it late to post something i went straight to floraqueen and they sorted me out . excellent site and very good witheir service .
negative	i called my bank and they claimed a chargeback using visa .
neutral	with great difficulty i got through to customer_services by phone , who then said someone would ring me back .
neutral	the ticket service at viagogo was efficient with useful on line information before the event .
neutral	i '_d definitely recommend this company and i would buy from them again .
negative	you get no information unless you contact them and then you receive an_email within an_hour .
positive	i would recommend them to you if you were considering parting with an old_mobile .
negative	march 00th : " you will get a refund at the end of march ."
neutral	great customer service team , willing to help always friendly and give great customer advice for people who have never purchased from them before .
negative	i bought some products via_groupon_vouchers , as some other people did , rubbish quality for a £_00 luxury duvet , returned it immediately and its been over 0_months_ago and never got a refund .
neutral	sales simply not competent enough to listen and deliver the correct information .
negative	as a footnote , i used parcelmonkey instead of these_cowboys for my most_recent parcel .
neutral	my only_gripe : painfully_slow delivery time
positive	so all done and dusted in a short time with piece of mind .
neutral	as a buyer its first_class purely due to the choice .
positive	an easy website to use and always quick .
negative	when checking my bank_statement in mid dec though i noticed a refund from very , rang them & they confirmed they had cancelled the order as they were not in fact getting the item in ( but didn_'_t have the courtesy to actually inform_me of this in the 0wks since ). then it turned_out they hadn_'_t refunded the shipping . so i spent probably the cost of this on phonecalls ( was cut_off twice while ' on hold ' after battling through the lengthy & inaccurate voice recognition menu system ).
neutral	however , the first booking was perfect , everything went well .
negative	the following_day i received an email_saying the items would be a few weeks until they were in stock .
positive	kept me fully in the loop
negative	mr frank chimezle doesn ’_t even get close to that !
positive	does what it says on the tin
negative	this year will be no different .
positive	price was cheapest for size required .
negative	seven weeks_later after numerous_emails and phone_calls , i still have no refund .
neutral	recently i went online to send a package to coventry . i noticed it would be cheaper to take it myself to a local drop - off point , there were three points very close to me , about 000 hundred yards to be exact . i went to the first , who said they did not do it anymore .
neutral	it is your business and you run it the way you want , but if i had the choice i would choose another option
neutral	no call , so rang them again .
neutral	they don_'_t like the fact you bring insurance but they can '_t say no when you have the documents there .
neutral	this is a bit of a worry , as i have relied on 0st choice for several_years .
positive	delivery was quick from the date of order - didn_'_t have to wait 0_months like some other furniture stores offer .
positive	dispatched the same day as ordered .
positive	was really simple to use .
positive	excellent value and speedy delivery , wide_range of fragrances even hard to find in the high_street perfumes will_continue you use them for all of my fragrance needs
positive	excellent service , thank_you very much .
neutral	hopefully they will still be at my work when i get back .
positive	a card for the 0 year_warranty from digitalrev came with the camera .
neutral	i bought some ram , done .
negative	this company doesn_'_t in any way approach professionalism .
neutral	got an e . mail saying it was on its way , still didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	one arrived the following_day and the other took a week to arrive .
neutral	i messaged serenata about non delivery .
negative	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three_times with no answer .
positive	i '_ve not used them since .
negative	the worst shopping_experience i have ever had .
negative	the lady was called penny and she was very nice but just after business .
positive	i was very pleased to stumble_across justkampers who have come throught on 0 orders so_far - i '_ll be back
positive	i ordered a tour_de france t - shirt for my son ( very last_minute ) and it arrived within 0_days of me ordering it .
negative	the next_day , i ring up express my displeasure .
negative	i '_m_sure that those friends will also pass on my experience and thus freedom0surf has lost a lot of potential business from me and my sharing of experience .
neutral	the plastic knob on the roman_blind fell_apart the first time that i tried to pull it , it split into two .
positive	the food was around the best price i could find for royal_canin and delivery free .
positive	i was really impressed with the service from e_- outdoor .
neutral	slow rersponse to query raised on the monday .
neutral	i didn_'_t have any_problems outbound except that it was difficult to find a place to park .
neutral	the help from sales before actually ordering was not great .
neutral	mind you , i am still_waiting for over £_00 due from august so do not really want to give a favourable response until this isreceived .
neutral	( i ask you ): and , secondly , the parcel arrived a day earlier_than stated .
positive	i have never had such effortless service from an order i have placed online .
positive	i had the unfortunate event of placing an order and then realise i ordered too many .
neutral	finally after a few calls on my side a guy arrived , no appology for being late .
neutral	would really like to use this site to order again however the delivery charge will stop me doing this .
neutral	shopping with shoetique was quick and easy .
positive	quick and easy to order .
neutral	great service and perfect flowers , however specified free delivery on the website yet i was charged a delivery fee of £ 0 . 00 even more anoying is my mum could of picked them up they are only around the corner
neutral	when i said that had i put an exact description that they would have had less knowledge than my previous description i got a very rude email from someone there who said if it happened again they would close down my account .
neutral	i booked a vw_polo diesel with centauro at murcia_airport for a week and was quoted a price of € 00 . 00 but when i collected the car i had to pay an additional € 00 . 00 for excess_insurance plus a whopping € 00 . 00 for a fuel_tank of diesel which incidentally is more than it costs me to fill up my bmw_000d at home .
negative	and in response to your pathetic reply_below i would like to add the following here .
neutral	had we met this man first we would certainly not have bought either the mazda 0 nor the mazda 0 from you .
neutral	the web_site was well set out and easy to navigate .
positive	brassware '_s easy to use website let_me find what i wanted .
negative	sent in my working iphone 0 in good condition .
negative	when i called them they said they had issued another invoice and the goods would be with me within a few_days .
neutral	fine .
neutral	i run a property_maintenance business and have used your company many_times
negative	the itinerary described by rickshaw was not identical to the one we actually recieved , and the itinerary wasn_'_t even met by our tour_guide !
neutral	wrong order received .
negative	will_definately keep on complaining and keep going higher until they refund me !
neutral	the representative was not interested in being friendly , identified the part bundle , i later found that i could buy the single part as an individual item
negative	they have done this to many people judging_by the reviews .
negative	i then told them that i wanted to cancel my contract with them , and was told " oh that has to go through as a separate request , we can '_t do that until the cancellation of the other request goes through ".
negative	never going to use this car_park again apart form being very unhelpful with the damage the car_park is a quite a distance away form the actual terminals and you end up having to wait for them to leave which we ended_up waiting 00_minutes to leave even when no one else was on the trip with us .
negative	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
negative	!
positive	many_thanks
negative	phonecall to say they could not supply as advertised
positive	will_definitely use priory again for my next lot .
negative	would never use this company again and wouldnt trust them to deliver the parcel let_alone pick it up !!!!!
neutral	happiness restored .
positive	i ordered a messenger ogio bag and i was very pleased with the quality and service freestyle_extreme gave_me .
neutral	we had a bad_experience at the holiday desitnation and it took lots of correspondence to feel as if we had been taken notice of
neutral	.
neutral	service on - board is hit and miss , the cabin is not always cleaned_properly ( dirty tray - tables eww .) and the food can be a bit mediocre considering it '_s price .
neutral	for this reason , i think the ( almost negligible ) booking_fee should probably go , as some sites don_'_t charge it .
negative	edgware .
neutral	the job was done eventually - but i won_'_t be using them again - sorry !
negative	i have no idea how companies like this stay in business .
negative	all in all a terrible experience , customer service does not exist .
neutral	flowers very good delivery not so good i was behind front_door when driver delivered he never knocked or rang bell dropped flowers on the step and walked_away
neutral	the hotel number did not work so had to call another department who messed_up my booking and i had to call back a further 0 times to sort it out .
neutral	i ordered 0 doors from kershaws because the prices are good and they stock a variety of sizes which i needed and couldn_'_t get in the normal diy_stores .
positive	very effiecient i will use again !
positive	joanne
neutral	anytime you phone the call_centre , the staff either don_'_t have a clue what they ' re talking_about ( i '_ve had to phone apple who '_ve re - directed me back to tesco on numerous occaisions as tesco staff say they can '_t deal with technical questions about iphones !)
positive	so , i spent literally weeks deciding on a company and a product .
negative	they told me that the girl who cancelled the instalation did not know that she had to cancel the instalation on two computers and this is why the switch had went_ahead .
positive	less time spent looking - more time and money to enjoy the brilliant offers that dealchecker brings .
positive	the cushions are nice and thick .
negative	companies with that kind of money_grabbing attitude do nothing to help their reputations and i will happily be staying with rackspace .
negative	was told order would be delivered monday , rang monday am to confirm , they had no record of the order but had my money .
positive	kirsty on the livechat was v v helpful with me as was the gentleman on the freephone 0000 number . the best customer service : )))
neutral	one of the items included a 0kg box of cnp_pro recover .
neutral	then when my wife tried the jacket o when we eventually received it 0 days late , , it was to small so i returned it requesting a large , but was automatically issued a refund as i think you had no large in stock but did when i initially ordered which was frustrating .
negative	i will not use barrington_sport again .
negative	do not use this company !!
positive	great prices too !
positive	thanks
negative	unbelievable after several emails they still do not respond despite asking for a full_refund . my sister eventually received them 0_days_later in a very sorry_state after being in the couriers van for 0_days with no water !!!
positive	thank_you .
neutral	i recently had a large expensive order delivered in shocking packaging .
negative	of course , by now the other_outlets had sold the watch .
negative	day 0 - i ring up .
neutral	order received promptly and was left in secure_place as requested when placed order .
negative	please do not waste your money with this firm , they never delivered the goods and then fob you off with forms you can not down load , and you do not get your money back . i am putting this on facebook .
neutral	i ordered two identical items which two_weeks_later were still outstanding .
negative	it states 0 - 00 working_days to receive order , i am still_waiting since 00th_oct_0000 , still no sign of order .
positive	all of the family enjoyed these exellent steaks would definetly reccomend .
positive	iphone_app also works really and saved me a packet when trying to book at short_notice .
negative	driver was 00min late even_though we asked for pick_up time recommended by the company for travellers from non - eu countries .
positive	top laptops at great prices .
neutral	the capsules sometimes aren_'_t punctured properly and lose a lot of the coffee to the drip tray making the amount in the cup much less_than it should be .
neutral	after a 0th phone_call the mattress was delivered with the box ripped_open and the mattress marked .
positive	purchased norton_000 ; excellent price and speedy , efficient delivery .
neutral	i had to travel to birmingham for the surgery as only certain days were used for the procedures in the north_east so i was not happy about that .
positive	just used holiday_nights to book a stay at the club julian in marmaris and was very impressed .
positive	0 days from_start to finish .
negative	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
positive	he came a hour early , no_complaints .
neutral	in the end i had to ring the carriers & explain my predicament .
neutral	slightly_misleading i feel .
positive	well_done rwe .
neutral	the book itself is really good and i am happy with the product however i paid £_00 for this book one picture is printed wrong and a couple are blury i no when blurly they came up with the explanation marker however on these they didn_'_t and have printed blury hear however are not blury on my computer therefor i '_m nt sure what to think i just think that have my number they should call if any doubt !
negative	our delivery number was item id_0000000
negative	. not according to wh , whom say my the bets stand , but my account is closed , my open bets are still running ?
negative	that '_s the least they could do as i only got 00_% !!!!!
positive	i have sold a couple of mobile_phones and they have given me a good price each time .
negative	i am not happy and the customer service team couldn_'_t help or provide a valuable solution . the only_thing that they said is to wait another 00 days the parcel should arrive
neutral	my boyfriend is a big_fan of the superset clothing range so as a gift i bought him a jumper on - line which he_loves !!
positive	they arrived quickly , were great quality and value for money .
negative	do not buy this bed , no compansation even although they agreed the bed was faulty
negative	even when you say it crystal clearly , it gets it partly right as it repeats it back to you in it '_s mechanical prerecorded voice , but then it throws in a number or letter that sounds nothing like what you had said ( would be funny if it was a comedy sketch , the opposite of funny in real_life ).
positive	we even needed a small re - sizing after the surprise proposal which was done with ease and free of charge .
negative	on monday 0th_december i received conflicting emails from parcel0go , one asking me to submit a claim because the dolls_house may be lost / damaged ( didnt say which ) and one saying the dolls_house should be on its way !
neutral	potentially good but let themselves down by poor admin .
neutral	all reviews but one are from people who have not claimed .
positive	but my experience so far is good .
neutral	i think ebay is great for all its bargains you can get and you ca also make a bit of money for yourself if you have anything to sell .
positive	this is about the third time i have used their service and each time they did exactly_what they said they would .
negative	wasting a lot of time and more money to sort the problem and actually get what i wanted !!
neutral	some of the flowers did look as though they had been through the wars and weren_'_t that fresh .
positive	i would recommend them to anyone .
negative	i '_ve not had any previous communication , so this seemed a bit_weird .
neutral	it limited my holiday - budget !
negative	anyvan themselves are not interested when things go_wrong - they simply act as agents to put you in touch with movers and take a cut of the transaction via_paypal .
negative	yet it is they who owe me money !
negative	when i rang the reading branch where i had my treatment all i was quoted was how much it would cost me to see some one about my eyes .
positive	was a bit_wary about booking a small car but needn_'_t have worried at all .
neutral	as we were half an_hour early we were asked to " go and have a coffee " my husband was ill and i really needed to get him to lie down somewhere .
positive	all in all first_class service from tooled_- up .
negative	i ordered flowers for my mother '_s birthday and was very disappointed with them .
positive	silk_blooms it is , with our full confidence that mara and her team will provide beauty and quality on the day and a lasting souvenir to be treasured afterwards .
neutral	also it used to be the case that only a deposit was taken at this stage - or have i done this through a different web_site ?
positive	i will certainly use again & you should too .
neutral	in future i would go elsewhere and pay more to get a better quality product .
neutral	good - look and feel , choosing prices per leg , good to support independent company
positive	we subsequently ordered a smaller one to use at the computer in the bedroom - xl classic - much_lighter and much smaller , but equally as comfortable and just right for the smaller space .
positive	this is the first time i have used this type of website must_say very efficient service and prompt goods , arrived almost before they were sent would use again and would recommend to friends
negative	i call and call and hold on for minimum of 00_mins to get through to yet another recorded_message .
neutral	poor !
positive	highly_recommended !
negative	contacted groupon to be informed that the company had gone_bust the day before , mass email sent to all purchasers ( still to be received ) and telephone_call made to me ( an_absolute lie as no record of call being received or missed ).
positive	chose this company due to previous good reviews and the excellent price for the coats i needed .
neutral	please could you let_me know where my policy is i thought it would have come through the post by now .
negative	i really can understand how a company like this can still be in business .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my order but have been advised to wait 00 days .
positive	great value for money and superb quality !
negative	no voucher after 0_days so i called again , explained all what happened again just to be told , that it will take longer because of the bank that doesn_'_t work on weekend .
neutral	p . s .
negative	parcel 0go the worst i have ever come_across , they dont deliver parcel and mark it down as delivered , when a fuss is made they then tell you no it was not delivered courier made a mistake .
negative	of time due to the inefficiency of all of the above .
negative	my son saved his pocket money , xmas & birthday money and bought a laptop at pc_world on the isle of wight .
negative	what a waste of time for all concerned .
positive	it '_s as easy as pie .
neutral	however .
neutral	with driver advising us an_hour before he was to arrive .

neutral	i compained to animed who immediatly offered to replace the product or refund some of the purchase price ( just under 00 %).
neutral	would say though , the delivery was exactly_what i ordered ( one week started pack ) and it arrived all on time along with my free calender and book .
positive	the price was fair and the delivery very swift .
positive	ordered 0pm tuesday .
negative	the bed arrived the next_day ( tuesday ) and when we went to assemble it found that the side_bars had no holes for the slats to fit in .
positive	good service
positive	i '_ve bookmarked the outdoor shop and will_definitely be shopping there again .
neutral	i should not have do that and i am disappointed with frost this time , as their service is usually first_class .
positive	good price .
neutral	can '_t really say anymore
neutral	but we both felt it very "' hard_sell " on the insurance .
neutral	delivered on time however , would have been better if you '_d put a note through the door stating where you had put the flowors as it was not in an obvious place and they were left_outside for 0_days
negative	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
negative	disgusted with this service and will never use again !
neutral	so i had them credit me for two packs of coke and then bought them again in 0 transactions .
neutral	apart_from getting a non valid return which i hadn_'_t booked , there was a £_00 charge for using a visa_debit_card , not maestro .
negative	confirmation once the amount has_been re - credited back to your card .
positive	they '_ve managed the impossible and made healthy also tasty .
neutral	debbie xxxx
neutral	although i certainly wasn_'_t angling for anything , it '_s great that he took my feedback so seriously and he '_s taken my negative experience and turned it into a positive .
neutral	i soaked it in wd00 and after a while , it worked satisfactorily .
neutral	bought the product easily , but nowhere did it state how long delivery was , or if it did , it was not very clear .
neutral	i received my order as promised , only to find that the same item was available online for £_00 less .
neutral	the customer service is good .
negative	tried to buy a tv , recieved conformation of order and then nothing , no reply to emails and phone no is to an orange answer service to whitch no - one replies .

positive	plus i love their points_system !
negative	.
negative	unable to give promotional_code when i chose hotel as no option
positive	they keep me and my tenants up to date throughout the process and i never have to worry_about anything .
positive	all my orders arrive within a couple of days and the quality products available at 0 for the price of 0 is excellent value for money
positive	ordering was easy checkout too .
neutral	i had to go to the post_office in heavy_traffic when other supplier sends door to door overnight .
positive	would definitely recommend handtec to all
positive	easy ordering and quick delivery
positive	great value and fast delivery , i am very happy with my glasses .
neutral	the last time i bought this lotion there was a £ 0 + price cut offer per bottle .
positive	i have recommended glasses0you to all my friends and family .
positive	my enquiry was dealt_with on a professional_manner .
negative	she made me feel as if the error was totally my fault and showed no empathy .
negative	even if they have a good reputation , i can only go by the service i received , ( or in the case of my mothers missing flowers ), did not receive !!
positive	very pleased with bags purchased .
neutral	i recently_bought a number of items of garden equipment including two draper branded garden rakes - stainless_steel with ash handles .
neutral	i liked the text_message updates about the delivery progress .
negative	" round the corner ."
positive	they came the same day to quote and after accepting the quote the work was completed within 00_hours .
positive	everything i have ordered from beautybay . com has arrived earlier_than_expected and have been as required or better_than_expected .
negative	the advertised flowers showed no_resemblance to those supplied and i feel that my experience with serenata_flowers is close to false pretences or at_least one of misrepresentation .
neutral	and by that time nespresso might have launched their new vertuoline machine in the uk , with the redesigned pods , which will be an interesting development for both companies !
positive	i went_onto the insurandgo website and was very impressed with the clarity of cover and how fast and easy it was to take out the policy , i would highly_recommend insurandgo to anyone looking for travel_insurance .
negative	extremely dissapointed
neutral	i went to this site as i have used them before and the service was fantastic .
positive	good service , lots of boilers ready off the shelf .
positive	fast efficient accurate service and delivery - good thoughtful communication - quality product at good price .
positive	they have one of the cheapest and professional services around .
negative	i also bought , at the same time , a safety skirt and a weather cover , but the accessories that were sent were for a 00ft_trampoline and were therefore too small .
negative	thought it might be different based on the claims about mutual benefits and sound ethics .
negative	!
neutral	they turned_up to install a yale system which turned_out to be inappropiate to fit and their advice was to add more which would cost me another £_000 approx .
negative	i feel 0_star is even too much for this company , and will never shop or make another registry again with toys_r_us , or babies r_us .
neutral	they are good at providing information and tirned up on time .
neutral	i gave them 0_stars because the place was great but the service was one star .
positive	really pleased with the sevice i have received .
positive	we had known about key for sometime but were rather concerned_about what it involved , but when sarah_jane visited us she explained all very clearly and set our_minds at rest .
negative	i decided to sign up to primus but then changed my mind .
neutral	i am happy with it but it could have been better .
positive	bathrooms and showers_direct came up with the best price , and delivery was received within 00_hours .
neutral	however the product i purchased which was a ring is not a very good standard .
positive	i particularly_liked the tracking process and website .
negative	it seems to me a ridiculous way to run a company , cancelling genuine pre_- orders from interested customers just because they won_'_t pay for the goods potentially a year in advance .
neutral	their lack of any phone customer service is hugely frustrating , especially as i had moved and the website would not allow me to change any details , although i tried five times !!
neutral	i rang to re - arrange the delivery & was told between 00 - 0 pm the next_day which was another work day so no - one at home .
positive	no ., considerable_saving over other quotes .
neutral	that '_s just not on .
positive	i saved over £_000 . 00 by buying second - hand , and the wheel is in very good condition .
negative	they refused to pay out and i had to pay full cost of the car to the lease company and they black listed me so now have to pay over £_000 per_month for insurance instead of £_000 per year .
negative	talk about shooting yourself in the foot .
neutral	i love the 000_% mullberry silk throw i bought . it '_s like a soft , snuggly blanket .
positive	the speed of processing my sale and delivery of the payment into my account was first_class
positive	i needed a good lazer printer and although i had one in mind the excellent salesman gave_me a great overview on the possible alternatives which i found very informative .
negative	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn_’_t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance_department .
neutral	the guy '_s who were delivering the cars were very good but i still had to wait nearly 0 hour gor my car which really delayed me getting home .
negative	and refund my credit_card and i would go_elsewhere .
neutral	i would have rated this service much_better but fail to understand_why something like this can occur .
positive	great service
neutral	this is not customer service only exhibited by large retailers , and it is worth_investing in if you want return custom .
negative	the top of the cooker gets very hot and the inside of the oven over - heats .
negative	this time thought i was mortified to find that even_though i paid extra i got a standard bunch of flowers and the message in the card was not added so it simply said ' no message required by recipient ' in the card !!!
neutral	i telephoned again and thankfully dealt_with a much more reasonable person_who was polite , apologetic and placed a replacement order for me .
neutral	i had a very mixed experience with serenata_flowers !
positive	when i did eventually place my order , i wasn_'_t sure about the photographs of some of the tints ( i was looking for prescription_sunglasses ).
negative	so you place the order .
positive	it only took a quick phone_call to a very helpful advisor to book my car for our holiday to australia .
neutral	the coffee_machine_broke_down on the return_journey forcing me and my family to go to other areas to obtain drinks .
neutral	i took delivery of my tree seat in a very damaged box .
negative	company miss sold iphone insurance for my wifes and mine .
negative	i only hope npower is better !
negative	the next_day i put them on and within two hours i began to have headache .
negative	but hey each to there own .
positive	product choice and quality is excellent and i can recommend bestbathrooms without_hesitation to all looking for good quality at a good price .
neutral	the flights were substantially_cheaper_than booking directly with the airline operator ( strangely ).
neutral	but was not as smooth as it should have been and if you are going to give a stock check on the site , please ensure this is updated or else there is no point .
neutral	ordered in plenty of time for it to arrive , but it took nearly two_weeks from dispatch to arrival of my order .
negative	twice booked a hotel in oxford and got a booking_reference e_- mailed .
positive	i logged on to the iflorist website on friday_afternoon , two_days before mothering_sunday about 0 . 00pm .
negative	they have too many competitors to worry_about using them again .
positive	all flights , transfers , pick - ups and excursions were arranged for us and we had not one issue with any of these , everything_ran so smoothly from the moment we flew out of heathrow to the moment we landed back .
positive	not only was i impressed that you actually had the parts i needed , ( the drill concerned is pretty old after all ), but the prices are good and so was the helpful attitude of the staff and even the delivery courier service deserve a pat on the back !
positive	firstly , i had a query_regarding finance which was answered_promptly and efficiently .
negative	that '_s very unclear in the receipt the i received !
neutral	i had to order elsewhere for her gift .
neutral	i e_mailed my brother in law to check : no sign of the flowers .
neutral	concerned that the recipient had a lot of difficulty_finding out who had sent them .
negative	but . the guaranteed next_day delivery isnt guaranteed at all .
negative	i booked online on wednesday_afternoon 00 march for an mot on friday 00 march and was told it was booked in for the pm and my credit_card was charged .
positive	a fast and good quote was followed_by an excellent service .
negative	it seems to me at_least that 0 , 0 and 0_star reviews are never published , if this were true they would be deceiving the customer who believes their review will be published but will not .
neutral	i ordered 0 items and two did not fit me i would like to return the goods and have filled in your return form twice and so_far i have not received an address for returns .
negative	he said no problem .
neutral	booking the car online was fast and esay . however picking_up the car was not !!
negative	it seems that then i have to call you with some code number he has given me to request my money back !
negative	a total refund was expected of £_000 but i got £_000 .
positive	so far so good !
positive	moreover , once i put a wrong_address by mistake and only noticed it when i got shipment confirmation .
positive	overall , an experience to be recommended – and at half the high_street price !
neutral	overall , i would use them again .
negative	they offered to do a re - print if i would send them a photo of the book to prove i wasn_'_t lying .
positive	the item arrived very quickly and very well_packed .
positive	i would highly_recommend mazuma to anyone .
neutral	may use a slightly more_expensive provider next time with 00_min transfers .
positive	great experience from beginning to end .
negative	this company are scammers - do not touch them with a bargepole
neutral	they were slightly too small and , being plastic , the machine was not able to pierce them .
positive	they quickly agreed to collect the item and replace it .
neutral	i would have expected a screw in type of plug that was tricky
neutral	preorders usually arrive a day early , so you don_'_t mind_paying the £ 0 - 0 extra shopto seem to charge for new_releases , however gta_v was released , paid the extra £ 0 over amazon / game etc and the game didn_'_t come early , despite_being emailed saturday stating the order was dispatched .
positive	i ordered the goods and they were here even before i expected them .
negative	when trying to book online , i went to submit the payment and it was just loading and loading but not going through .

negative	the shed that i ordered was great well built and easy to put_together however customer service was terrible and shedstore was not able to resolve a simple problem .
neutral	if facebook are reading this ; then here '_s my message .
neutral	i must_admit that i love river_island handbags and they do tend to last .
positive	i have nothing bad to say about them and in an instant would recommend to anyone who is wanting supplements and workout fuel .
positive	any_queries_answered_promptly .
negative	parcel posted on 00 september still not arrived evening 00 september and the tracking service provided by the delivery company states it has never left their sending depot let_alone arrived at my house
neutral	delivery needs to be by a more switched on company .
positive	enjoyed excellent veal fillet_steaks , and tasty lamb_chops .
negative	if you don_'_t believe me , believe the people who have taken the time to set_up their own facebook pages - here '_s one .
positive	prompt service and delivery .
negative	might be cheaper to stick an ad in the local rag .
positive	i decided to use simplysupplements for my supplements for the first time and am very pleased with the service so far .
positive	eases the pain of giving up by giving you the hit without the pain
negative	0_star is 0 too many !

positive	computer was delivered in time and fully tested .
positive	very happy customer .
neutral	note that their response comes about 0 months after i wrote my initial review .
neutral	i also wanted some boxes to put products in that needed gift_wrapping , very hard to find , but rajapack had some so i thought i would give it a go .
negative	booked at 0 :_00pm last night and when i arrived at car_park they had no evidence of my booking which held me back from getting to the airport and also had to leave my keys with them in case they didn_'_t get your email which further holds me up on my return_journey as i will need to call into the office for my keys - not a happy customer
positive	we will be using again soon and will recommend to family and friends .
negative	other printers i have spoken to and given further orders to , tell me the design i have paid for is mine to use foc in the future .
negative	this company is very cheeky and quite rude .
positive	then had to wait in another day for them to collect it . then to top it off they didn_'_t have any of the correct_size mattresses left so was going to have to wait for them to get more stock in .
positive	five_star operation !
neutral	i was mollified by the fact that when i returned home and looked at the website again there was a special_offer which partly compensated for the train_fare !
positive	i was very impressed by the delivery service , it arrived quickly and they kept me informed as to arrival time , and were spot_on with the estimated time .
neutral	several_occasions i '_ve waited at home and no one shows up to collect parcel and when they do turn_up , my customer has to go to main depot to collect parcel
negative	then on april 0th i received notification from air_france advising me of time changes to my flights .
negative	when i contacted just eat they did appologise and told me that the money requested from my bank_account for the meal would be put back within 00 days and any concerns should be taken up with the take away .
negative	tried to make a purchase from this store it takes your details and then puts you to the amazon web_site .

neutral	i am still_awaiting my computer back and to know what the problem was with the computer .
neutral	issue i have is we bought bedding which wasn_'_t needed , so i wanted to exchange them for a double_bed instead of a single .
neutral	i paid an extra £ 0 for next_day delivery to n_ireland & was very disappointed when my new bluetooth sony sbh00 head set didn_'_t arrive for two_days !
neutral	i ordered a bed from this company as it was the one we were after and other_sites didn_'_t have it in stock in their warehouse .
negative	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer service number .
negative	i have subsequently been contacted by the company again who have accepted that they will replace the chair with the broken seat but confirm that the rest of the furniture is to their normal quality and this is what i should expect .
neutral	this is the 0rd time i have used tyre_shopper , but the 0st time i have encountered problems .
negative	our son fell on a welsh mountain while on a school trip on monday .
neutral	filled in as necessary , although the " do you take any tablets " name them section , which then dropped down 0 reasons for this was very technical .
positive	the ordering process was very easy and quick .
positive	i will definitely you them again .
negative	sono le 0 di sera .
negative	purchased table and chairs about 0_weeks_ago .
neutral	good for underwear but useless on one size items and stretchy items .
positive	delivery company also first_class .
negative	very disappointed with my 0st order , do not think i will be re - ordering .
negative	while i accepted that there was the possabolity that the surgery i had might go_wrong , i did expect there to be a " pulling out all the stops " to make_sure i was well looked after should it do so .
neutral	lets_see what happens .
negative	my house got hit by lightening and had no phone line for over two_weeks , phoning for updates was horrific as you knew you would be patronized by an agent calling you by your first name and not understanding much more they said .
neutral	they even reverse out and try again . all this because the signage on the web_page and at the airport are confusing .
positive	steve '_s heart_operation went well , he is out of intensive care and he cannot wait to smell the freesia .
negative	after all this i have just received an email from this joke company bearing in mind they damaged my phone this is the response i got also the two letters mentioned were sent by recorded delivery to the managing_director not the sender of this email as he seems to think . read this : and think before you fall for it .
positive	fast and friendly company to deal with .
neutral	the item was shipped shortly_thereafter and was received within a few_days .
positive	memory worked no problem .
negative	i purchased the maxfactor natural minerals foundation and i phoned up to complain_about it .
positive	we received our sign and were really pleased . i suppose you think it is a high price , but when you examine it , there i a lot of work in it . my husband was impressed with the overall finish and different depths of the letters and we think the cream fits in well with the magnolia walls
positive	my last bed was quite old and although it still felt ok i was needing a new one .
neutral	the order arrived swiftly and enclosed a wonderful thoughtful addition of a chocolate .
negative	i told them i had cancelled it , they confirmed this in email on 00th_december and said refund would be in 0 to 00 days .

neutral	very disappointed .
positive	they arrived quickly and were just what it said on the website .
positive	always arrives when stated .
positive	so thanks to all at nevada , i '_ll definitely use you again !
negative	i have spent in excess of £ 0 attempting to contact this firm on numerous_occasions .
negative	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
positive	the good thing was that it was scented as well .

positive	ordered product and the whole_experience was easy .
positive	our invites day and evening were delivered super quick and looked even better in the flesh .
negative	we could even hear him shouting at someone on the phone .
negative	i for one will never ever use them again and would encourage_others to pay that little_bit more for your energy in return for a company you can actually contact and who have some semblance of customer_services dept !
positive	i have been hunting high and low for replacement drawer_runners for some treasured but aging bedroom_furniture and could not find them anywhere until someone recomended eurofit_direct then all my problems solved by friendly and knowledgable_staff who helped_me place my order on their extensive web_site .
neutral	bought many bits and bobs from here to go with my mini .
neutral	i now have my order ( delivered on tuesday ) and as a result i '_m happy to update my rating to 0 .
neutral	there was also a ' choose free_gift with your phone ' option when choosing a phone to buy , which in fact just gives you an expensive item along with the phone the cost of which is added onto your contract , so rather_than free it '_s just a pay monthly item .
negative	rude , abrupt customer service when i have spoke to them on the phone , treat you like an_idiot , talk over you and play dumb .
negative	i have used this company a few_times and every time had problems , parcel not collected on time , parcels not delivered on time , i can reach them only by chat , latest package was lost , had to do all the legwork for them and send all the documents , it took me about a day or 0 to get this sorted and finally refunded .
positive	postage is a bit_pricey but if theres something you want and for a specific date then it '_s great .
neutral	everything was fine with ordering carnt_fault it . my only_complaint was i would have liked an_email or phone_call to let_me know goods had been despatched then i would have known they were at_least on their way so therefor i missed the delivery and had to make other arrangements for them to try and deliver again .
negative	when we got back this morning i was told we are very busy and only have one driver and you are 0rd in the queue .
positive	at every_stage i understood what was going on , how much i would have to pay , how much they were making out of my transaction .
positive	as my prescription was for varifocals a lovely optician gave_me a call to run through the basics and delivery was within 0_weeks as promised .
positive	this was also confirmed by the 0 people i referred .
neutral	got my tickets for one direction belfast in november i did pay alot more than ticket price but dont really care because the look on my daughters face was priceless .

positive	myself and my sister use them all the time and do our friends .
negative	i tried to speak with cpw customer support so they could explain this report to me .
negative	he is currently trying to get people to give him £_000 for stands at an_exhibition in milton_keynes - they may well find themselves shafted .
positive	i am buying everything via quidco - ebay , holiday , insurance , printers , pcs , stationary .
positive	would highly_recommend saxon .
negative	they sent me knowingly faulty goods , then tried to deny receiving the return in order to keep my money and sell the item to the next poor sod !
positive	xx
neutral	also , the options to choose where to leave the flowers , as you state are for if no one answers to a knock on the door , they are not the main delivery instructions .
negative	i then email iflorist but by 0 o ' clock the following_day i had still not received a reply .
positive	i used their pre_- oiling service which is well_worth it , their follow - ups ( one call and several emails ) are re - assuring and not at all pushy , and their own delivery assistants were polite and knowledgable , arriving bang on time .
neutral	but even for men it could have been a little_bit less large .
negative	sending out offers of free business_cards which turn out not to be free after all .
positive	really happy with them ( and the free style file ).
positive	really pleased with blinds fitted_perfectly and excellent quality and a very reasonable_price would highly_recommend
negative	the part was also completly the wrong piece .
negative	i would not recommend this service to family or friends .
negative	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let_me re - post or post another review about this company ?
neutral	after a couple of weeks and a few more issues , i now have two lovely matching bedside_cabinets .
positive	i '_ve also purchased a favourite_perfume of mine at an unbelievable price - i '_ll not buy from the high_street stores again .
negative	but they '_ve created a sports monopoly - the reason_why football costs so much .
positive	fantastic on price and delivery next_day !
neutral	considering the funeral wasn_'_t until 00am the flowers looked like they had been there all night , they were floppy , lifeless and quite a few petals had fallen_off .
positive	except i didn_'_t as the jacket was great .
positive	highly_recommended !
negative	reported the defects to customer service .
positive	i have always been happy with the products and the service - they are my ' go to ' site for any glassware , bar etc .
negative	i have also lodged a complaint on debenhams website , but they haven_'_t bothered replying .
neutral	if i had bought them from a garden_centre , i could plant them when it '_s convenient to me , rather when it '_s convenient to suttons .
negative	over complex and very difficult to deal with .
negative	i had never_heard of via go go before .
negative	i had ordered what the plumber had told me so left it for him to check when he was coming , when installing it we soon realised we had the wrong sink 0 holes instead of 0 , when i rang up they apologised and said they would send the correct one out but couldn_'_t send it out till the day after next as they '_d missed the courier however the plumber could not come_back then as they had another job so i '_m without a sink when i received the correct one the plastic bit that goes in the drainage hole was snapped and broken luckily i had another from the wrong sink to replace it , the following_day after_realising we had the wrong sink when the plumber was installing the shower_tray the waste was missing to save time he popped out to buy one but the cheapest was £_00 i rang customer service to tell them and by that time i was very frustrated i explained this was the second mistake and i was not happy they agreed to pass it on to the manager and the manager would ring me this was 0am in the morning it got to 0pm and still no phone_call so i rang them back and i was told i had been given a refund i asked how much and i was told £_00 !
negative	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
neutral	after purchase i was informed 0 out of the 0 were out of stock and therefore dispatched half an order .
positive	good service ,
negative	. despite email_confirmation !
negative	please allow an extra few_days for us to process your request .
positive	more to the point is that the person that they were for was absolutely over the moon with the flowers .
neutral	they way i like them .
positive	their price is cheaper_than buying from the manufacturer director !!
positive	i would recommend to all .
negative	by the time i contacted them the price of the booking had gone up by £_000 .
negative	this companies determination to build a monster store in place of the present perfectly_adequate supermarket has created huge local resentment - they should listen to their customers many of whom have ,
positive	i felt quite distressed and then went on to chat and nathan put me at ease immediately .
negative	regardless of the fact i paid less_than full price a company has a duty , surely , to fulfil their promises !
neutral	the gates are now working fine but it was an uphill struggle .
positive	quick delivery .
neutral	also , receptionist in the garage , was not customer friendly ( swearing ).
positive	excellent site , easy ordering , fast delivery , one of the best .
positive	i use millet_sports for all my tennis equipment , so i can only comment on that , but all i have to say is positive .
negative	booked top price tickets back in september , 0 month before event informed that my seats are no_longer available and i have been moved to alternative seating which are 0 block further away and also in a different price bracket .
neutral	i would expect next working day delivery for a cost like this .
negative	you cannot charge for something when you have agreed initially that its for free !
neutral	they were very pushy and persistant and most unwelcome , in the end i threatened to cancel my order ( over_£ 0000 worth ) if anyone phoned again .
positive	that '_s an unbelievable bargain far one of the best driving simulations ever made !
positive	i was impressed by the speed of delivery .
negative	00 days_later i received a reply telling_me i needed to send it back for a refund .
positive	the main_reason for choosing the kitchen_appliance centre was the value for money .
negative	i explained to them that the whole reason i purchased it from a high_street store is because i wanted to be able to return it quickly if anything went wrong with it .
negative	the site obviously uses a bot program to send emails to your inbox from women who are apparently interested in you .
neutral	the reception said they knew nothing about it , faulty towers springs to mind .
neutral	the box that the flowers arrived in was quite badly_damaged which wasn_'_t the best first_impression to my colleague_who '_s flowers they were ( a birthday_gift ).
positive	i wasn_'_t well off and needed a new pair of specs .
positive	i have also used the bbw flapjacks chocolate peacan and berry flavours . these taste amazing , were great value for money and fit_perfectly in my diet !

negative	i ordered 0 pairs of track pants on 00th_january_0000 .
neutral	you may have gathered from my rather weak comment that whilst i was not enthralled by the item , i was ok with it .
negative	if they cannot guarantee 00_hours , then don_'_t state it and hide the caveat in the terms and conditions section .
positive	it was delivered the day after i ordered it .
positive	superb :-))
neutral	the manager bustled about in a way reminiscent of basil himself , rectifying everything as quickly as he could .
positive	very happy with my order .
positive	pc works_fine .
positive	thanks !
negative	we paid viagogo £_000 for £_00 ticket , what a rip - off !
positive	i can '_t say enough to praise the quality of the design , the efficient personal service , the choice on offer and the impact factor the finished_product has .
positive	oh , yes , first_class precision delivery by dpd .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that the biggest size is still a bit smaller than the size it says it is .
neutral	i then had to reoder them .
neutral	all the tech help_desk was able to do was ask me to send a screen_shot , they were quite hopeless in finding a reason for the fail .
negative	we had all the lines dissconnected as none of them were actually fed to our house . ( my dad happens to be an ex bt manager and came round to look into what the hell was going on ) we went 0_months without a phone line but this wasn_'_t the issue .
neutral	however i was very disappointed to find when i opened mine that there was a hole of about 0 - 0 inches down the seam of the skirt .
neutral	other than that i '_m happy to recommend the company .
positive	i decided to use hatched to sell house because in my opinion there is no justification for the crazy amouunts of money that traditional_estate_agents charge .
neutral	there are many things that frustrate me about the service .
neutral	i have still not had my free_spins yet , so . since my cool off , nothing has changed .
positive	bought for my son who loves_his superdry stuff .
positive	i would definately use this company again !
neutral	i emailed straight_away , clear_instructions on the email about returning items , however as it was after office hours , there was no reply .
negative	i mean they know we are coming and at wha time .
positive	my son is very happy with his new matress .
negative	in regards to the second order , there never was no keeping_me informed , as that was sent on next_day delivery that failed to show .
positive	that is rare today .
positive	in hiring at christmas time we faced hefty prices on car_rentals .
negative	i contacted them and they said there was no problem at all !
positive	i will use pharmacy0u again . very pleased
positive	bought these for my mum who had been suffering with her joints and muscles .
negative	when we dared to argue about what service we should offer they will argue with us and push us to keep lowering the price groupon are only interested in them selves not the partners and not the customers and the service they provide is disgusting .
neutral	e_- mail communication with the firm was excellent and supportive , but very reluctantly i had to ask for a refund .
negative	dreadful service .
negative	after a delay , and having sent in my scrip , i was then told the item would not be in stock for a further week !
positive	the flowers i ordered were delivered as instructed and were lovely ( so i am told ).
neutral	the delivery is good but more education about the herbs used etc would be good .
negative	i would never buy anything from them again as i know if i had bought from a reputable_dealer such as [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference_] we would have been refunded .
neutral	being cordless makes it a delight to use and its is quite light .
neutral	luckily she seems to be getting the hang of potty training but we have found this product useless .
positive	i await my purchase eagerly and if it arrives and is a beautiful as they seem i will be sooooooooooooooo happy .
neutral	overall , it was a fairly positive_experience but i probably_won_'_t do it again .
positive	first_class service from sale to delivery .
negative	the vase was smashed on arrival .
negative	will not be recommending isme to family , friends , colleagues - in fact quite the opposite .
negative	there are other_places which provide a much_better service .
positive	thank_you .
neutral	i purchased them , so what is going on .

negative	this was my first purchase with reidys and i spend a lot of money annually on equipment .
positive	i had erred on the side of caution and ordered a medium , but i found that i may have been able to use a small after all - made me very happy and i will_definately remember that for next time !
neutral	i love the picture but i am not happy with the item .
neutral	once i had a delivery date it was hassle_free .
negative	i ordered a violin bow almost 0_weeks_ago and was assured delivery in 0 working_days .
neutral	parcel_force were due to deliver on wednesday , then a note from them said they would deliver the following_day , but when i called at 0pm to find out whether they were going to deliver that day , i was informed that in fact the item had gone back to their depot , so we had to collect it from there .
negative	cl0000
negative	never again will i ever use monsoon !!
neutral	although i wasn_'_t actually in when the parcel was delivered and my nan was the and box it came in had ' the drink_shop ' printed all over the box so i think she may of guessed what she was getting for her_birthday !!!
negative	received a callback from sarah ( ashley '_s manager ) who stated it was perfectly_acceptable for protect_your bubble to ask their customers to divulge their passwords and that this had been checked and confirmed to be acceptable by their compliance department .
negative	do not waste your time ordering online groceries and expect this company to honour any details they send you , including the estimated time of arrival or dellivering your groceries at all .
positive	it was all boxed very nicely so all i had to do was wrap it up .
positive	would highly_recommend the furniture_market they sell excellent range of products and give the customer service to go with it .
negative	misleading_advertising .
neutral	previous post in error , thought it was in relation to airport_parking - travel_insurance was for childs application - on line application is ok if no medical underwriting required .
neutral	also the air_conditioning could not be used as when it clicked in it came on with a rumbling sound again waking us both up when it was on .
negative	do not use
positive	would highly_recommend and use again .
neutral	hi , i was really pleased to find your site , and you offer a great variety of low - cost trophies which were perfect for the informal awards_ceremony for my football_club .
positive	i water_damaged my iphone_0gs , and i was unable to get it fixed anywhere , it was truly destroyed !
positive	it arrived in a few_days and perfectly at a reasonable price .
neutral	the advisor then said your entitled to a free tv plus package , there were no extra_charges mentioned even after i asked .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for my delivery refund by the way .

neutral	in full so i was worried when i came back that i would be charged again
negative	very rude customer service .
neutral	great , so how am i reading about it in my flat ??
neutral	the staff were most helpful and the item had to be delivered from another shop .

neutral	my order was lost in the post and i will have to wait 00 days for a refund .
neutral	i have used holiday_autos for many_years and have always been very satisfied .
negative	bought a reg from car_reg , for childs 00th_birthday .
positive	prompt delivery
neutral	email response was a bit frosty to the returned item and a refund took two_weeks after repeated_emails asking why no refund , the postage yet to be received is to be posted by cheque .
positive	animed were kind enough to spot this and called to rectify and to refund for the second order .
negative	we had the receipt .
neutral	delivery was good but the flowers were a little_disappointing - they were somewhat crumpled and looked more like supermarket bought quality .
positive	the only_disappointment , he wouldn_'_t reduce the [ very good ] price !
positive	very pleased with my new akg_headphones .
negative	but they said the dimples are the design of the frame and ignore what i said about the n mark on one of the arm .
neutral	my partner is always a size 0 and the woman assured me that this style did not come up large .
neutral	hi , love the products , good prices , delivery service was brilliant , unfortunately have spoken to customer_services three_times to try to resolve problems of being unable to login to my account and place further orders .
negative	it arrived in good time , which is why i have given the company one star .
negative	the quoted price was £_00 . 00 per_tyre with a big heading saying " buy 0 tyre , get 0 free " although the total_cost came to £_000 . 00 !.
neutral	even then i ordered a second one
negative	i mentioned while i was on the phone that the mobile number left on the card was actually for a local gas company , but yodel confirmed the number was correct and told me to phone it .
negative	i have now spoken again with the proprietor of ++++ and he has kindly been out with his satnav to see if he could locate another business the tyres may have been delivered to in the piostcode ???
neutral	on checking with madfun the following_day , it was still in their warehouse , and would go out shortly .
negative	i ordered a couple of items of clothing .
negative	this is a scam .
positive	!
positive	fast delivery etc .
positive	provided good information on expected delivery dates and alternative tyres when preferred tyre was unavailable from the manufacturer .
positive	within minutes , i received a helpful telephone_call from tayna regarding the battery fittings .
positive	i would definitely tell my friends to shop_here !
neutral	the stick on feet protection are rubbish and if you put them on and then move the item , they come off straight way - we paid_extra for these and they are a waste of time .
neutral	i was disapointed when the site said the product was out of stock , however , ordered anyway .
negative	please delete my details from your database , i will never use you for flower delivery .
negative	this is particularly annoying in that yesterday i spent some time on the phone giving precise details of how to find my home and passed on my home number and mobile number .
positive	i have used several packs of bombyx_mori - it contnues to do an excellent job . i am in my early 00 '_s but quite fit for my age :_o and it has made me very virile .
neutral	nothing appeared on tuesday or wednesday so on thursday i contacted the courier to find out what was happening .
positive	would definitely recommend to any contact_lenses user
neutral	delays happen , and the measure if any company is what they do to put things right - kitbag always used to be my first_port of call but .
positive	excellent prices .
positive	great quality kit and easy to follow_instructions for the return courier .
negative	shop through others for bargains the £ 0 . 00 p_+_p does exist don_'_t pretend it doesn_'_t to justify telling everyone it only cost you a fiver because in reality it cost you closer to eleven quid . it '_s an invitation to treat .
neutral	we literally paid £_00 for nothing !!
positive	i love this site .
positive	the perfect combination .
neutral	rang the helpline ( no order number as i didn_'_t take it ) and they found the order " oh_dear it doesn_'_t seem to have been processed " even_though i had a e_- mail_confirming the order but , and this is the important bit , no e_- mail saying it had been shipped .
positive	had what i wanted , which i found easily enough through the website .
positive	the canvas came within 0_days of ordering , it was packaged well and the print quality is excellent .
positive	i had some questions concerning the handles that i wanted to fit .
negative	i was transfered from one dept to another untill finally had enough , asked for the supervisor only to be hung_up on .
neutral	i ordered a 00 month_xbox_live_subscription , working it out that it would arrive by the latest first_class delivery rate of 0 days , before my gold ran_out .
negative	staff don_'_t seem surprised and willing to accept situation , with one exception will , but nobody will pass my calls onto him
positive	was surprised to find that the person_who ansered the phone was helpful , patient and knowledgeable .
positive	if only all companies_operated this way !
neutral	this is not the first time i have been sent wrong items , recieved goods in a second rate manner ( dirty and marked ), have suggested on each_occasion for them to have a word with the warehouse staff who do the picking .
positive	excellent from_start to finish
positive	i always use viovet it '_s quick and easy and you save_money
neutral	unfortunately we all don_'_t live in a very nice honest environment .
negative	decided to try waitrose '_s online delivery service .
neutral	at last they turned_up 0_weeks after the order with half the order missing .
negative	paid for the vouchers was told to wait for the codes .
neutral	my only_criticism is the delivery , you pay quite a lot for the service , you get a call to arrange a day , all good and then they come 0_days early !!
positive	well recommended
negative	customer_services were again less_than helpful .
negative	i paid £_00 . 00 for a bunch of half_dead flowers which would have cost me no more than £_00 from asda , and they would have been superior quality .
negative	lets_hope that the product is in good order when it arrives , if not we '_ll end up in the court arena to resolve_matters as i '_m fed_up with such bad customer service & a clear breach of contract .
negative	the next_day , i called .
neutral	when we finally arrived at the avis_desk there was a very short queue , but it still seemed to take an age to get to the front of it .
positive	will be buying again
neutral	the only_downfall is the join on the back of the metal box was broken when i opened it up .
positive	from purchase to delivery , everything was smooth .
positive	good quality products with a prompt service .
negative	account often wrong and still now having problems with them trying to charge me money i don_'_t owe !!!
neutral	the radiator was also broken in our elderly_parents room and perhaps if the heating had been switched on ready for the guests ( a nice_touch in december to welcome your guests who have paid a lot of money ) this could have been spotted .
positive	very efficient service .
negative	they ignore emails , do not answer phones .
neutral	they gave_me a full_refund and since everyone makes_mistakes i ' d still recommend you buy from ss00 .
neutral	i was disappointed that i didn_'_t receive the quality that i expected but very impressed with how well they responded to my request .
neutral	the product was genrally pretty good although i did need to alter it as it was alot bigger_than i had expected based on the size_guide .
positive	purchased wood effect blinds for bathroom .
negative	given option to accept or reject
positive	can '_t fault the price or service .
positive	coolshop . co . uk was the only place to get more stock in .
negative	i understand itv is reliant on advertisers but i get so infuriated it makes me never want to shop or buy from those suppliers .
positive	would highly_recommend this company , excellent value for money and super_fast delivery .
negative	when i arrived to pick_up the car their rep had gone home !!
negative	after approx 0_weeks the jacket returned however the main fault to the inside lining had not been repaired .
neutral	you just have to guess_what flowers at that cost might , or might not look like .
neutral	note : although i was given the car free of charge it did mean that i had to pay double the petrol money for all of us to enjoy the outings we had planned .
neutral	- boite vocale au téléphone ,
neutral	except when my order came , one of lenses was damaged
neutral	the customer service was very good and speed to contact was excellent .
neutral	ahhhhhh .
neutral	order agreed and dispatched on schedule , but the week end intervened - they tried to deliver on a saturday , no one in , so no delivery .
negative	but like everything else this has_been totally_ignored .
positive	thanks mazuma .
negative	ordered a nice phone for the wifes_birthday in plenty of time ( i thought ), advertised as being five in stock !
positive	very pleased with the result .
neutral	i shall not waste any more of my time trying to leave what i think is a fair review of the product .
neutral	leaving me the stress of rearranging a number of appointments .
positive	the website was easy to use , making my hectic_life a lot_easier !
neutral	it would have ben helpful if the delivery team were able to unpack the furniture .
negative	they were more helpful but informed me simplyelectronics had never initiated a refund .
positive	can '_t fault the products or the service .
neutral	website is well_designed and clear , paypal acceptance is helpful for quick orders .
positive	quick and easy service
neutral	it '_s useful to have nearby for emergencies , but price and reputation keep the stars low !
neutral	next , i shared with the person calling me that " i had never been called before prior to a delivery - the product use arrived " - after initial disagreement , i finally convinced her this was the first time i ' d been called for a delivery .
positive	never been disappointed to date .
positive	the t - shirt is the highest_quality , i will_definitely be purchasing more clothes from here . top boys !
positive	they also have some great deals if you buy products in bulk .
negative	i do not think this is the kind of review you would want , but never forget the little man , he or she is the one who built your company into what it is today
negative	lying robbing scum !
negative	no correspondence from them at any stage of this saga and no apology just some rubbish about chinese new year .
positive	beautiful strong plants obviously grown by experts i could not be more pleased , if i ' d been there picking them myself i doubt i could have done better .
positive	ordered on sunday_night and received delivery on monday .
negative	and yet again , we were stranded by our tour_guide who stayed and watched the show for free .
positive	well_done , we have the piece of furniture we wanted .
neutral	no apology for the poor service

positive	my wife and i were going away for our ruby_wedding_anniversary which was on sunday 0st september .
negative	during the process debenhams reorganised a separate delivery .
neutral	trust your instinct when reading a review and judge by the language / grammar used and which group it represents i . e single , family , couple etc .
negative	poor poor poor
positive	i received the blinds within 0_weeks of ordering them on - line , they fit_perfectly and look funky !
neutral	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use again , but keep track of your order .
neutral	asked for delivery on a day when we knew somebody would be here to accept the delivery .
positive	i would recommend this site .
neutral	it may be that they do not realise that a lot of keen amateur photographers use elements , or else there is more profit in their other products .
neutral	i am very pleased with the service and would have ordered more tiles however the sample i ordered was white however was actually off white and therefore it didn_'_t match the rest of my tiles .
negative	the seller said he would refund my money - but i never got it back .
negative	update 00 april_0000 - two_days ago , they offered an_alternative that i accepted ( same frame , different lense colour ).
neutral	although the acknowledgement said it was out of stock ( no mention of this on the website or i would have ordered elsewhere ).
positive	i will definitely recommend this to all of my friends to use with their iphones !
negative	we also now have to wait for the refund to come through .
negative	i called them the next_morning .
positive	registering on their site gave_me many options of further interaction and i felt that there is a strong emphasis on creating an exceptional on - going customer experience .
negative	i carry around a pin camera on my jacket button incase there is any trouble .
neutral	i used to visit it daily now i just don_'_t bother very much .
neutral	i '_m just glad i hadn_'_t had to take a day off work !

positive	great service and highly_recommended .
negative	and what a catastrophic disaster .
negative	if you want a reliable service don_'_t use them .
neutral	now , i am unsure what the exact difference is between the 0 tyres but i wanted to keep all the tyres exactly the same as the original that were on the car and at the end of the day it is a different tyre .
neutral	i asked if there was anything that could be done on the postage and they refunded it in full .
neutral	i have found the people on the end of the phone when i have a query to be a bit stern and unfriendly to say the least , but you can '_t knock the prices and the stuff does always turn_up even if it takes a while .
negative	family i referred are also feeling conned .
positive	cushions arrived as said and they are lovely quality - infact hubs was really pleased and even said how nice they were .
positive	i placed the order and it arrived pronto .
negative	it simply would not charge .

positive	perfect service - and we had a great time last_week at the rfh .

negative	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
positive	not tested properly yet but suit looks_smart with a good fit .
neutral	disembarking also fast and precise .

neutral	i was so excited_about ordering the buggy and was really pleased that it would be delivered straight_away and now i '_m just really disappointed and frustrated and panicking that its not going to arrive in time for baby .
positive	a first_class service 00 / 00 .
positive	i could not fault julesb one bit , firstly on price , keeping_me up to date on the location of my package and then the presentation of my goods .
neutral	i ordered 00mg bananarama and strawberry fields , the banana failed_miserably on all counts , whilst the strawberry i '_ll give a 0 out of 00 , i can taste a hint of strawberry , and there '_s no horrible after taste , it is one i will use whilst my search continues .
negative	her answer was sorry we cannot inform you with our exchange_rates !
negative	called more times and spoke to agents who recognised the mistake each time and apparently ' rectified it in their system so we would be sent a correct final_bill ' - however this " would not be until january ."
positive	the comp booted_up lightning_fast and is now acting as a tv recorder and music centre .
positive	top_class , keep it up

negative	avoid at all costs
negative	i recently_purchased a mattress from this company that i had meticulously researched .
neutral	ordered the flowers and specified a morning delivery . had not arrived by 00 noon and when i rang to ask the whereabouts i did not get an answer . they arrived in a parcel_force van at 00 . 00 with no card in them . wont use them again .
neutral	the flowers arrived late in the day ( although just within the delivery window ).
negative	i was going to let them take this ludicrous dd , just so i could issue a winding up petition against them for the satisfaction of repaying them for the stress they have caused me plus interest .
neutral	on the morning of the delivery i received a phone_call from the dispatcher informing_me they were on route and 00_minutes later they had arrived .
positive	competitive_prices , good communication , would shop there again .
neutral	sent on a wednesday with a promise of a return by the weekend .

neutral	!
positive	this is a second time that i ordered .
neutral	i also requested a delivery date of the 00 . 00 . 00 and the flowers got delivered the day before .
positive	the ghd_air is fantastic !
negative	there does not appear to be anyone available to sort_out any_queries once they have taken your money .
positive	thank_you - in this day and age it is difficult to find companies who are so efficient .
positive	in a single word , it is " great ".
negative	interparcel have done nothing proactive to try and get this parcel to me in good time .
positive	item arrived quickly and was well_packaged .
neutral	we were , therefore , very disappointed to find one very small gerbera and white_lilies , pale_pink flowers and other white ones substituted .
neutral	i had to chase repeatedly and i had to twice cancel my kitchen_fitter .
neutral	did not like the idea of pay up front before you receive the goods .
positive	delivery time accurately predicted .
negative	not even if you are desperate use this company , sell your goods at a car boot sale , you will get more money and you wont_be left waiting weeks on end .
negative	they did not turn_up .
negative	if i could give no stars i would !
negative	totally misled and feel let_down .
negative	i thought that was the end of it .
negative	you have to pay £_00 upfront for collection and place a new order where you again pay £_00 for another delivery .!
neutral	not impressed nor was it clear that it would take longer if you placed the order after a certain time .
neutral	i '_ve_used ebay for several_years .
negative	avoid both companies like the plague .
neutral	what she got was a little bunch that looked nothing like the picture .
neutral	after the third day of waiting the courier web_site showed the order had been destroyed .

negative	always found cheaper prices onlinr and elsewhere

positive	i have just purchased the essentials package with the help of caine alvey .
negative	yet , only recently i found out , it was not actually closed : my credit report still shows it in an active state .
neutral	find it very frustrating that we have had several_occasions when my card has_been declined through no fault of myself which creates a problem at the bank .
neutral	so i wasted money on postage sending my perfectly ok phone to gadget_panda only to be told a lie as to the received condition .
negative	haven_'_t received it yet !
negative	we are very sorry to hear this however why would we intend to hold your money if we have gone_through all the hassle of pick_up to avoid
negative	with this said , please immediately contact us again using this email thread in any case no refund confirmation will be received after few more working_days .
positive	had was i was looking for straight_away and was cheaper_than ebay , and free_postage which was delivered very quickly
negative	this is unacceptable .
negative	as the payment page was loading i googled them and discovered their true_colours .
negative	lack of phone number makes it difficult to speak to anyone . wouldn_'_t use this company again .
negative	seriously ?
negative	the adsa non drowsy hayfever / allergy 00 pk x 0 which had been substituted but had not been sent .

neutral	the parcel wasnt large so why it couldnt go with rm i dont_know !

positive	they arrive right on time .
positive	repair man called and at 00am friday said washing_machine was finished .
