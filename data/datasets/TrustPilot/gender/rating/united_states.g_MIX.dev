negative	i ordered an hvac fan for an audi_a0 from parts_geek .

neutral	my last purchase was included three different mugs .
neutral	equipment was missing .
neutral	we were not able to enjoy the amenities because we had another engagements .
neutral	patricia bendall
neutral	the plectrums would have fitted into a small jiffy_bag , instead they were dispatched as one order in a small bag inside a box approximatly 00 inches square which had then been filled with packing .
neutral	megan sat in the front of the megane , wow what a car .
negative	didn_'_t confirm delivery address when i paid through paypal clearly enough ,
positive	i can trust that anytime my credit_scores are looked at i '_m informed .
negative	they are a racket .
negative	then because they also advertised free_shipping for an order of $_00 or more , i ordered a couple of additional items that i thought i could use as well .
neutral	there are four things i feel could make the shopping_experience with ami much much_better .
neutral	only problem that i had was the package showed_up slightly_bent and the label paper had a small crease .
negative	pic shows a wiring connection , which would have been great .
positive	furthermore , their prices are competitive , or even lower !
negative	an_automated email informed me that a customer service representative would be contacting me within 00 - 00_hours .
positive	i will use bookbyte again !
neutral	!
neutral	flight is usairways .
negative	the moment i find a competing site that offers their service for the same or lower price , i '_m canceling this account .

positive	promptly despatched , although dhl did take one day longer_than they should have at the uk end .
neutral	bad pick_up
positive	the result was a trip of a lifetime , mingling deeply moving experiences delving into the difficult history of this country with the amazingly vibrant city life of cape_town and the eternal wonders of safari in two different safari camps .
neutral	i wanted to start 0 0 / 0_weeks from now , but as soonas i reserved it , they called and said it was first come first served . and that if anyone came and wanted the unti they would give it to them unless i paid for the partial month rent .
positive	items were exactly as_described .
neutral	a bus turned_up as we were just leaving the car_park , the driver was very helpful , said it would indeed be quicker to walk ( he was estimating an_hour to get to the terminal because of traffic ) and told us rough directions to get to the terminals .
negative	your site is awful especially if i don_'_t get all the things i ordered
positive	i needed a gift for friday and i only ordered it on the wednesday .
positive	i order my part , and i got it next_day .
neutral	while i booked the car from adelaideairportrentals , they didn_'_t explain that in the event of an incident , i would be out - of - pocket with the excess $ 0000 .
neutral	the site had ' free ' shipping for a certain_amount , but they deduct any coupons from that amount , so it is no_longer ' free ' shipping .
neutral	will only use it again next year if i am desperate .
negative	worst packing i have ever_seen !
negative	after installing the engine ran slightly better but still on not all 0 cylinders .
neutral	not so impressed with this .
neutral	the booking agent was fairly slow , and it took a while for him to understand that i was booking this room for someone_else vs . myself .
neutral	so , don_'_t think i '_ll use this again , will just go thru the hotel itself .
neutral	so in other words . the clothing runs on a small sized of the stated size .
positive	excellent product , excellent service , excellent all_round .
negative	i , connelly

negative	thank_you .
positive	try it right now !
positive	always satisfied .
positive	on top of that , the price was right , especially after being quoted prices by various other_firms both in the us and in europe ranging_from $_000 to $ 0 , 000 for a return .
neutral	i bought a pot of mask sealant but it didn_'_t come in the branded pot as_advertised , it could be silicon grease for all l know .
neutral	seats on ongoing flight were obtained with no problem .
positive	.
neutral	the only truly positive thing i can say about the breakaway cruise was the entertainment .
neutral	the confirmation_email came through ( a month after the process was started ) and boom we was back in business , could of done with a bit more communication to let_me know the status of my order and a bit more onus took onboard by the company that took the money , very slippery shoulders me thinks , but all in all i paid my money and got what i wanted so yeah eventually was satisfied .
positive	i would love to visit the store in ny sometime , bet it is as great as the online store .
positive	the cost was $_000 for the pump to my door for almost_half price . thank_you thank_you .
neutral	good service , as packages made in home in the same condition however missed the collection from pick_up company even_though i sat in all day and the buzzer never rang to the flat and reorganisation was difficult due to end of term university arrangements .
negative	having got a phone_call 0 hours after writing this review , my protein phoned me and promissed to sort it out and phoneback , or email the following_day . that was last_week i '_m still_waiting . no contact . no goods , but they have my money !!
negative	sunday my card was charged and i was told it would that 0 to 0 days before it would be made right .

neutral	i '_ve gotta_say , if you ' re looking for rare game products or even old gems from the ps0 era play - asia is the site you wanna visit .
negative	he then tried to make up new excuses about the cars being finally hertz cars but had been previously booked months ahead , i told him i was not informed that it was hertz policy to guarantee cars only months ahead .
negative	in my opinion it was a very unacceptable experience .
neutral	next_morning when i left i checked with the front_desk and told them i was suppose to have a refrigerator installed .
negative	this time i have to wait on a check .

positive	maintaining assistance over a couple of months , without ever hard selling or us feeling pressured to purchase - rebekah was a delight to work with and we would have no_hesitation in recommending her or the process and will certainly maintain her details for future orders .
neutral	secondly , i sent a note to customer_service asking about how i could still use my groupon ( where i learned about you ) b /_c i anxiously ordered this litter before i had the groupon , figuring i could use it the next_day ( had to wait one day to use for some_reason ) on some dog_food .
neutral	to whom it may concern :

positive	delivery is always really quick and i ' d definitely recommend them to friends !

positive	fast , efficient , well_packed and two chocolates too !
positive	although we felt the labels were a bit_pricey ( almost didn_'_t order them ), the quality was excellent and they made a big_hit at our family party .
positive	i wondered_if there was a catch as the price was 00_cents a gallon less_than on the street , but the lady said there were no other charges .

positive	the quality of this company is reflected in their awesome products from clothing to vitamins .
negative	do not understand when you ship wrong part why i cant get my money back .
negative	we went thru viatour and because of our limited time , we decided to splurge and get the expensive , skip - the - line , small group day tour that covered versailles , and the petit trianon where marie antoinette basically had a barbie ’_s playhouse type set_up .

positive	easy to order , great specials , fast shipping !
negative	between me and my brother we spend at_least $ 0000 a year on supplements and seriously thinking about shopping elsewhere like bodybuilding . com .

positive	had the most amazing time at this incredible town home in orlando we found through house_trip .
neutral	a bit sweet and does not always mix well .
negative	i have contacted other tape distributors and they have proper start - tabs on their tape in the correct place .

neutral	order was placed 00st november but didn_'_t receive the products until 00th_november .
neutral	take it off your website then before people place orders !
negative	i ordered 0 pair of open toe pumps .
negative	however , when i tried to connect from my hotel in prague , i was unable to do so .

neutral	i was pretty worried when i saw the awful packing job especially because it was a present for our son and we were presenting it the very next_day !
negative	disgraceful
neutral	they also charge a " wasted_journey fee " as well as a " collection charge " this totals £_00 on top of the 00_% restocking_charge for the items we purchased .
negative	it has_been 0 days still no contact .
neutral	when i went to the post_office i was very unhappy to realise i had to pay over_£ 0 in postage to guarantee you received it .
negative	i '_m guessing they are going to chagre me a restocking_fee for their error in the listing of the part .
positive	would highly recomment purchasing from this site .
negative	cannot_believe this - they will not send a courier with a replacement pair and take the wrong pair away .
negative	i hate the way they don_'_t pay their employees fairly , and the fact that they discriminate against women !
negative	no one picked_up the phone .
positive	i was issued a credit and the company put a trace on the necklace .
positive	the front_desk staff were friendly and helpful .
negative	later that day i found out expedia over charged me by $_000 , plus , expedia charged a $_00 fee for each room each night .
negative	i was sent the incorrect part and returned as directed and received three quarters of my ourchased price money .
neutral	so first , got answer within the few_minutes ( hence the 0_stars ).

neutral	it doesn_'_t release well and it does not adjust

neutral	plus , the communication between the company coming to pick the part and me , was not very efficient .
negative	i am so surprised by all the good reviews as it is honestly a terrible website .
positive	the only_suggestion i have is to post the recommended dosage on the web_site so that i could have set_up the autodelivery right_away instead of having to wait_until i got the product to figure_out when i will need more .

neutral	not what i expected .
positive	everything was as expected .
negative	and i shout it sarcastically .
neutral	he is very pleased with the mattress topper , not at all with futonland , their service , inhospitable customer awareness , lack of accommodation in being_able to actually see the item , and just a general disappointment overall .

negative	additionally i found the on line ordering web_page not very user_friendly ( like the amazon one ), for example i could not alter the name of the delivery address name to my son '_s , the name had to be mine .
neutral	fedex leaves packages in the driveway , regardless of weather and then sneaks off .

negative	in response to tennisnuts ’ reply :
negative	there is no excuse for this , as the site clearly_states which locket is which and the catalogid on my order detail matches the one on the site for the " decorative line border ."
neutral	i may cancel the auto - ship all together - and perhaps find a pet - auto_ship site that will allow me to have that freedom .

neutral	however i was disappointed that a gift i bought for my daughter as a christmas_present and which she could not take adfvantage of within the dates are causing her a problem in redeeming .

neutral	bei ebay findet man tolle schnäppchen , leider ist ebay nur noch zum kaufen empfählenswert , durch die hohen kosten die ein verkäufer hat lohnt es sich fast nicht_mehr etwas anzubieten da man einstellgebühren bezahlt + 0 % vom gewinn abgeben muss , wenn_man als verkäufer paypal anbietet sind es sogar 00 , 0 %+ 00 cent .
negative	that way if you need to change anything , you are able to do that without a hassle .

neutral	after 00_hrs of travelling i just wanted to get to bed and eventually agreed a $_00 a day upgrade to a ford_escape suv after declining attempts to get me to agree up to $_00 a day upgrades .
negative	the way this economy is , the lowest_prices will lure people in but good customer service keeps them coming_back .
neutral	the website was easy to use , had lots of choices and was easy to complete purchase .
positive	still have to return an item that doesn_'_t fit me but had no_problems with this last time so look_forward to an easy returns process again .

neutral	i was happy with the price we got but very disappointed that we could not set specific qualifications for rooms , etc .
neutral	no .
negative	?
negative	the mistake is not a big_deal but no response from customer service is a big_deal .
neutral	along with the tables you had in atlanta we ordered chairs that aren_'_t scheduled to ship until 0 / 0 / 00 and stools until 0 / 00 / 00 !!
neutral	it would be important to know up front what the discount options will be so a decision about the items to order can be made .
neutral	i absolutely love the clothes although some clothes are not true to size .
neutral	yesterday i spent 0 hours on hold , then an asian - sounding agent i could barely understand came on the phone and after about 00_minutes of futzing around said he couldn_'_t help me and transferred me to the " concerned dept " .
negative	if the site would have just said out of stock i wouldn_'_t have wasted my time and just went somewhere_else to begin with .
neutral	i did get a confirmation number at time of check out , but i believe industry_standard for on line ordering ~ you normally get an_email with details of the order and the confirmation number ( kind of a summary ) right after your transaction .
neutral	however , we did receive one incorrect part .
negative	too many emails to me with products i dont want and dont relate to my purchase
neutral	it is much more difficult to make reservations than it used to be .
positive	prices are good with very quick shipping .
negative	my order for a few shorts and tees were so poorly met , i wondered on what makes them a name in business .
neutral	if i had to replace a fence again i would purchase from somewhere_else that i could go and view panels first to check the quality before purchasing .

negative	bought rims from them they look correct tires fit put them on the car the center holes are too big the buick emblems will not fit i asked them if they can help me out all they did was say send them back after paying for a mounting and balancing and putting them on the car this is not an option i cannot get_ahold of a person to talk to only computer bs this company should not be in business a small refund or something would have at_least showed they cared but not letting_me talk to a human is the biggest insult to any customer never do_business with parts_geek !!
neutral	the first time i ordered something from the website , it did not label that the items i wanted were out of stock so i waited for a week and realized they didnt ship anything yet so i emailed them .
positive	they were quickly dispatched to northern scotland where i found i suddenly needed them which averted a minor disaster .
positive	arrived pristine and perfect .
positive	i was delighted with the results .
negative	don_'_t bother calling customer_service instead do their job for them .
negative	i contacted the company to cancel my order and they informed me that ukmail had tried to deliver several_times to my home .
positive	cheap prices on horse wormers and fast free delivery would recommend and will be using again
negative	i placed a order with them and in 00_minutes i received a email .
neutral	booked car not available kept getting offered upgrades i did not want .
negative	i stated that i needed the drivers_side . only to recieve the wrong side . and they couldnt even offer to send me the right part while i was shipping the wrong one back .
negative	the company did however point out and very clearly that i could apply for a full_refund after i receive my documentation , should i not be satisfied with their product .
negative	she would call the hotel and call me back on my cell in 00 - 00_minutes .
positive	smooth process .
neutral	sorry to say but the cost of your postage and packing makes the item expensive .
neutral	the delivery was quick and the items were well_packaged but i would only use again if i knew i would not need to return the item .
positive	i ordered the parts , got them , they work well , and i will come_back to order from partsgeek .
neutral	two hours_later they called again .
positive	bookbyte also pays shipping to have the books returned at the end of the rental period . you just can '_t go wrong !

positive	fingers_crossed .
positive	easy to use service , with quick payment !
positive	thank_you for all your help in making my holiday decisions the right ones for me .
positive	i '_ve been after a new pair of running_shoes for ages .

neutral	when i called the automated customer_service line to verify shipment of the other 0 cards , the service indicated that my order had been shipped in may of 0000 !!
negative	i attempted to contact your company because i had a damaged part .

neutral	prescription from vet was on file and i received an_email that my order was received and would be shipped .

positive	would definitely use again
negative	!
positive	many_thanks , will shop at country_attire again .
neutral	i asked what it was all about and she showed me the paperwork which was ver hard to understand as she pointed_out areas that would get refunded upon return split into several categories as well as charges split into numerous categories as well .
negative	they said they wont take back items that are installed or used .
negative	the order hasn_'_t arrived and they have not responded to my request for assistance .
neutral	so consequently my order was late .
positive	i had wandered the internet looking for a great host at good pricing , after_reading a few forums online about hosting sites , i kept reading so many good things about bluehost that i decided to finally commit to them .
neutral	what a joke .
positive	it '_s great .!
positive	will be doing_business with again .
positive	last_minute gift for my wife .
negative	finally she said i still couldn_'_t talk to one but that she would honor the price .
neutral	lol
negative	if there is any other option available i will use that instead of this site .
positive	equally , at what for me was a very stressful life stage , i felt valued in that they cared enough to take time to fully understand my situation and talk through all the options available , nothing was too much_trouble .
negative	please get back to me as soon as possible .
negative	they say a refund will be given within 00 days of receipt of the part .
negative	got a sappent watch in the order broke the first day !
negative	bedeck do not offer a pre_- paid returns service for faulty goods and therefore postage_costs have to be paid up front by the customer and at £_00 x 0 this is a little annoying especially when i had to further chase the second postage_costs to be refunded .
positive	i was so upset when i couldn_'_t find my passport . two weks before our trip !
neutral	i order the july_0th and we are the 00th and i didn_'_t receive anything ( except an_email with a pdf ).
neutral	the preferred currency button is unreliable and has led me to being charged for a foreign rather_than a domestic transaction by my card company .
positive	if you ' re in the food service biz able kitchen is a great place to shop .
neutral	could do a lot better on communications and delivery .
negative	the second pair was fake leather but the shine on the boots was absolutely horrible .
neutral	i did not think to provide it because this was my second order for the same food , so i thought the information was stored in my file .
positive	great prices , price matching , free stuff and check out and great customer_service !
positive	i had no_hesitation and got the ink just in time on their promo day !
negative	i hope that they got them on time .
positive	proof of the pudding !!
negative	if you receive the part you order there are no_issues .
positive	something i had put off for three_weeks was over in five minuets .!
negative	i dette tilfælde har man lavet en_fejl et eller_andet sted i systemet !
neutral	reception coverage is never great but their desperation to keep you with them means they offer some good deals
positive	fast , reasonable prices and excellent service .
neutral	have to run ac fan one position less_than full speed or air comes too fast and is warm .
negative	i got a refund from united for the portion of my trip and a silly $_00 voucher to travel on their awful airline again which i will never use .
neutral	the good :
neutral	when i called the lady cpnfirmed that a message was on the system she just said she would call florist .
negative	when i called the hotel , the evil woman at the desk said i had to talk to you .
neutral	i thought it would have been white .
negative	our flight from atlanta to florida was scheduled to leave six minutes after our arrival in atlanta .
positive	we have used this service for a number of our larger shows and have been very happy with the service received .
neutral	in 0000 , i ordered a self - styled plaque and it was wonderful .
neutral	i may use again but will also investigate other_companies_offering similar services .
negative	then spoke to brandon and he did cancel and the hotel verified it was cancelled .
neutral	so i reserved 0 rooms and asked the agent if these room would be refundable if i did not need them all .
negative	shop online somewhere_else .
negative	i did not come in on an introductory special for 0 months or a year ,,, i assumed that would be the price for at_least a yr . not very happy with this roseville location and the attitude of the front_desk person .
neutral	a couple of times when i '_ve needed to make_changes , or correct an_error , the service couldn_'_t have been better !
negative	i couldn_'_t call them or reach them by email for several days .
positive	unreal .
negative	!
negative	that being said , when you make your reservation online and then an error is sent back that our reservation didn_'_t go through , and it says to call the reservation number .
negative	i will never ever make this mistake again and i will inform others also . so they don_'_t experience what i have !!
neutral	as my husband is physically disabled , this was a hardship for him .
negative	!
positive	i went with fonebank as i had used them before and even_though they offered £_00 less_than a few other competitors , they had much_better reviews and i already knew them to be reliable and trustworthy .
neutral	delivery is prompt and the threshold for earning free_shipping is very reasonable .
positive	a real " photo finish "!
negative	as for viatour , i read on tripadvisor that they use local tour places so we just got some total nut job by the luck of the draw .
positive	i love their sales .
positive	i pad like $ 0 for something that would usually cost me roughly $_00 for just one black_ink , this $ 0 was for the whole pack :) works great .
positive	der_preis war auch super , billiger wie bei media markt trotz versand .
negative	no authorisation process or acceptance process it appears to be immediate and is astronomical prices !!
neutral	is in fact referring to their standard shipping policy , while they write it to sound like that particular promotion includes free_shipping on all orders .
neutral	i '_m going to order some dresses and shoes and hope that these are better quality .
neutral	alto i find it hassle_free and good prices at the best of times .
neutral	perhaps a clearer description of the material they are made of would have painted a more accurate picture .
negative	however , the lady at the desk was pleasant and the girl who checked on me was nice , i guess they were wondering_if the room was ok . not !!!!
negative	!
positive	overall , i would recommend this website .
neutral	product was good , but could only be delivered by courier and signed for , this is on envelopes that cost £ 0 . 00 .
negative	i opened the yellow cartridge and it won_'_t fit into the printer .
positive	many_thanks for great service .
positive	pen as you get amazing quality at a very affordable price .
neutral	at £_00 it is expensive .
positive	speedy_delivery and constant_updates ( y )
positive	it was quick , exactly_what i ordered and friendly .
neutral	my first order was great .
positive	indeed , the non prescription was cheaper but the container was 00 gm , 00 gm more than the more_expensive container from the vet .
neutral	he came back and said something had dislodged and it was venting inside the dryer .
negative	partsgeek want me to pay for shipping the parts back !
positive	great indeed .
positive	after a few_minutes into browsing the site , i decided to try out their green_tea since it is one of the safest products available for weight_loss and nowadays everyone seems to be using it .
positive	from start to completion a very professional and competent piece of work done entirely to my satisfaction .
neutral	it was satisfying .
negative	i was not happy .
negative	after the fact i went to their website to watch a tutorial and they tell you there if you do not want the 00_% taken out to make_sure to tell the business that and you will tip them yourself .
negative	there is no facility to respond to their reply to your message , ( if you ' re lucky_enough to get one ), so you have to create a brand_new message again , and go though the same process , ( ie will they just ignore it etc ).
negative	finally i '_ve got the tires without_any headaches from somewhere_else !
negative	they need an invoice to look up our order , but an invoice is generated when one redeems the gift_card , and when a card is redeemed , they can '_t change anything in the account .
positive	delivery was prompt , the rollers fitted easily and do the job perfectly well . would certainly recommend this company .
negative	dato : 00 . dec . 0000 kl .
neutral	" ja , ja , " lød det korte svar .
neutral	!
negative	so i called , but the automated phone directed me to file a ticket .
positive	quick delivery and always have what i need .
positive	cant say anymore than that .
negative	on closer investigation i discovered the existence of a message sitting on my account from pph , from the time that the money was refunded into the " wallet " stating categorically that " the credit cannot be withdrawn and can only be used against future business through pph and , more_importantly , that it does not expire !".
positive	the whole_experience with ordering my kilt was fast and easy .
negative	!
negative	too_late to fight with hotel
neutral	on the whole i have had all the cashback i expected but a couple of times i have lost out .
neutral	when we arrived at the hotel they only had the first reservation with the wrong date .

neutral	unlike every prescription treatment i have tried you can use it without_having to worry_about the strong medicinal smell it can leave on clothes and on your skin .
negative	i have waited in the house the whole day for my parcel to be collected as arranged between 00 - 00_hrs and 00 - 00_hrs , but to no_avail as the couriers did not turn up , we have not had any ' phone_call to advise of a problem and have i feel not received any service whatsoever .

neutral	good choice of products , easy order and quick delivery - usually 00 - 00 days , but the package arrived in 0 days from order ( from uk to slovakia ).
negative	i could probably have gone to any of at_least five or six other_companies who without professing to offer an express service , might well have got the goods to me in a much_quicker timespan more especially in view of the fact that the transportation seems only to have taken a single day !

neutral	they even sent me the wrong bottle once but it was to my benefit .
positive	brill !
negative	it is as if the support tickets are not even being read by a human_being because they do not listen at all .
negative	don_'_t think i will be using them again .
negative	it '_s $_00 cheaper_than 000 capsules of nespresso .
neutral	i relooked at the picture on line and it has a " m " on the front not taiwan .
negative	turns_out the website does not have correct information .
negative	ok after all that , ( several days_later ) have just called them to be informed that the item is out of stock .
positive	a very good website with excellent choice of products .
negative	when i finally did speak with someone they told me they could refund me for the order i didn_'_t receive or reprocess my order free of charge .
positive	greg

negative	mid dec . the charge was returned to my account and the dispute was finalized , or so i thought .
negative	was supposed to receive in 0 days but did not .
neutral	i was in the house at the time but didn_'_t hear him .
negative	received yet more texts informing_me that items would be delivered , and yet again no delivery was made .
negative	i purchased an e_- book for my class and it downloaded and they charged me , however , it refused to open . needless to say , i won_'_t do that again .
neutral	i believe they owe me .
negative	even_though it was off season and an inclement day , there were busloads of people from all over the world clamoring inside for a view at things .
neutral	the prices on victoria_plumb are always good , and as a trade customer we are eligable for next_day delivery .
positive	thanks auto_europe !
positive	the review and order process was clear .
neutral	there is no reason for the styrofoam not to be on the ends to keep the radiatio centered in the box .
neutral	i can pull up nature ’_s variety products , but i have to scroll_through canned_cat_food , dry_cat_food , canned_dog_food . looking for the items i want .
neutral	my text never arrived , so i went online to find out my slot was from 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , and i planned around this accordingly .
neutral	i was told i can '_t order through the contact in watford because he isn_'_t linked up to the web offers or something , so ended_up having to pay for postage when i usually pick it up myself , which is quicker also .
negative	if everyone wasn_'_t staying at that hotel , believe me i would find a friendlier place to stay .
negative	this whole_process feels_like a scam and i am deeply upset and angry about how it has_been ( not ) handled .
neutral	0 .
positive	quality goods , excellent service and fantastic customer service .
negative	the customer service representative i spoke with ( after an_hour of transfers and holds ) was completely rude and condescending .
positive	excellent service
positive	this service was exactly_what i was looking for good quality good price fast delivery perfect .
negative	i '_m not sure i will ever use you again
negative	i paid a lot of money for what i was expecting would be a quality suit , and received a very poorly fit suit of cheap material .

positive	been there done that - i promise you i '_ll visit the page again !
positive	product as expected .
neutral	a man they send you so much stuff that you an '_t keep_up .
neutral	had to pay shipping to ship it back , just wished parts_geek was like other online retail_stores that paid for shipping for a small mistake .
neutral	equipment that was there was of good quality .
neutral	i went into the office and told the manager i thought he had told me it was due on the 00th and could he waive the late charge .
negative	when i called back the 0rd time a supervisor said sorry we regret loosing you as a customer but there '_s nothing i can do .
negative	overall , don_'_t throw your money away on a suit with this company !!
neutral	instead , i had to e_- mail them in order for them to have told me ."

neutral	i use to be able look at one to three_days plus or minus
neutral	not only was i disappointed in how my order was handled by way of shipping , the agent seemed to not care too much about my complaint .
positive	i will shop_here again .
positive	will use again .
neutral	i was not aware when i made the purchase that i would be required to sign for the equipment .
neutral	- has the most diverse selection of hostels out of any other hostel booking site
neutral	now , i will say that i hope our rep has learned a lesson about how to treat customers because we were quite understanding and had very simple requests that she chose not to follow_up on ( emailing us when it arrived , calling us once it was time to re - do the ring for the third time , and making sure to look at the ring herself before it was shipped out ).
neutral	it has_been about a week and a half i would say ,
negative	i would give them a negative rating .
positive	we will_definitely recommend boiler_juice to our friends !
neutral	brian and mary .
positive	it looked great !
neutral	test_equipment seems to be a good company good prices lots of merchandise , problem is there sipping department is terrible , took three_times to get my package to me with my product in it , they worked with me until i got my product
negative	i hope that this helps whoever is reading this

positive	the dog_food was the cheapest price i could find and it came in 0 days .
positive	ryan jorgensen
negative	00 .
positive	honestly i couldn_'_t have asked for more .
negative	they intend to ask kent county council '_s trading_standards department to investigate britishsupermarketworldwide . com to ascertain whether the company is trading according to the relevant regulations .
neutral	i checked the tracking again , and this time it showed that no , the items didn_'_t ship until the 00th , and would be arriving on the 00th .
neutral	håber de svarer på_deres trustpilot , sådan er_der jo nogle der driver deres forretning .
positive	i had searched for an extension for my outwell tent on lots of sites but the prices were putting me off .
negative	we rode through major_attractions standing on the ground_floor of the bus not being_able to see anything .
neutral	processing and shipping were fine .
neutral	had to call to inquire_about shipping .
positive	the service was excellent and by books arrived quicker_than_expected .
neutral	i really liked travelocity until i bought my parents a gift_card .
neutral	but your old service gets cut_off when they port your number and even_though my new provider had me all set_up , i had not received my new phones yet .
negative	my order still_hasn_'_t been processed & i still_haven_'_t gotten a confimation number from ups . this is quite interesting considering i paid the extra 0 - day shipping_charges near $_00 .
neutral	when the manager finally arrived , she dismissed us with no comment .
negative	ordered part then got email_saying it was on back order and they would not be able to fill order .
positive	not with birch .
positive	after a lifetime of heavy smoking i '_ve been vapeing with ecigwizard for a month now .
positive	they do what they say they will do , it '_s that simple .
negative	i have sent this skirt back to you and i still_haven_'_t received my money back .
negative	in fact i think i want my money back . i could have gotten shirts at walmart for a fraction of the price and could be wearing them now to cheer on our team .
neutral	clearly they do produce these items .
positive	we '_ll use them again
positive	we ran_out fast and wanted to order another can .
negative	but instead , what i got was a russian limited version where i can only play in russian .
negative	when i checked in and it was just a regular room , i called to complain and was again mislead by another representative whom told me she would esculate my issue to her manager and that i would receive a phone_call or email within 00_hours .
negative	asked for pre_- paid label to return item , but was told that it is my responsibility to return wrong item .
positive	however . i specifically wanted a service that provided installation as i am a single_parent with a slight disability .
negative	yes , that applies to texas as well .
neutral	very stressful .
positive	there is just one thing i would say and that is that you recommend filling the radiator with a special rust inhibitor and anti_- freeze - it took me ages to find some and then had to buy 0 litres as no - one did a smaller amount .
neutral	also you never sent me any confirmation on whether you had shipped some of my parts .
neutral	!
positive	i appreciate and i the information i '_ve received
neutral	i was really excited to see the layout of the program . very user_friendly .
positive	i shipped the microwave back after printing out the shipping label they emailed to me .
neutral	quick and easy
negative	they suck because when the part dose not work you have to email them and it takes them 00 to 00_hours for them to get back to you and they do not have a phone_number where you can talk to someone so you can tell them and speed up the fix be it replacing the part or a refund .
negative	a pre_- order code was not sent by the time they specified on site .
positive	what a pleasant_experience !!
neutral	my 00 - year - old_son finally got our tap free , but he was afraid that he was going to break the pipe in the process ( he '_s a weight - lifter ).
negative	i needed to make_changes to my order before it shipped based on info that was sent to me from pg stating that i would be receiving two of the one part i ordered .
neutral	suddenly she was told it would cost over £_000 to cover everything .
positive	live music videos , while you cruise !
positive	really good service and the store staff at york were really friendly and helpful .
negative	one top of that , within one day , my inbox had four email advertisements as well as three emails about my order - one asking me if i didn_'_t make a mistake bu choosing " one time delivery only ".
neutral	and i really loved the prices !
neutral	ie : £ 0000 over 00 months would be £_000 for year 0 and £_000 for year 0 .
negative	sent two images .
positive	website is easy and quick .
negative	they offered to send me swatches to help me pick an item to exchange my purchase for - sounds great , very helpful .
negative	still_waiting for order
positive	flexible payment_options , nice add - ons with the loss cover .
negative	after 00 years of staying with hyatt , i will quit if they don_'_t support me on this .
neutral	goods arrived next_day .
neutral	those that do persevere deserve a medal ( nothing like humility . lol )
neutral	the quality of the products received are great !
positive	seriously - i '_ve always been satisfied by the service and products .
neutral	had to put my details on card in five times as kept sticking , had to add address details twie as removed them !
negative	firstly , their webchat function wasn_'_t working and on closer inspection of webchat times they are as follows ; monday - saturday closed sunday 00 : 00 am - 00 :_00am ??
negative	when we arrived at the hotel we realized it did not have what we needed .
positive	i wanted a lot of dresses for the spring but than decided on getting into shape is better .
positive	totally_satisfied with chris the manager .
positive	good product selection and cs
negative	my gripe is with city_link but booked through interparcel - appalling
neutral	not good .
positive	your service is excellent .
positive	she was painfully emaciated , skeletal almost , and her blood - work was all over the place .
neutral	service was speedy .
neutral	but the hotel and staff were great .
neutral	la_livraison ( pas gratuite ) etait tres_rapide par_contre - sous le 0 jours ouvre '.
neutral	the folks hawking the tickets in the street are much more interesting than the guides , who seemed - truthfully - really bored .
negative	it never arrived and the blame was put on the courier company .
neutral	because of this we spent many wasted hours on the phone to support who , despite_being friendly and helpful , didn_'_t manage to resolve all our set_up problems .
neutral	some of the big_bus workers were abrupt and did not feel that they should answer the questions you asked .
neutral	the wait would be much more acceptable if i atleast knew what was going on .
neutral	i received my order within 0 days of placing the order !
negative	i ordered flat black frame black on black and got shiny one grey on top of the fact i order polarized_lenses and there not polarized now i '_m deployed and it had to send return mail and i '_m stuck with these glasses i don_'_t want , i will never us this service again .
negative	my trees arrived dead and seemed like nothing more than a bundle of sticks .
negative	the plane had already boarded .
negative	wrong again .
neutral	there was dry_food spilled throughout the carton since the three bags were torn .
negative	tried from friend '_s computer and still no joy .
neutral	i ordered a branded eyeglasses .
positive	i found the prices , selection and the personalized service to be great .
neutral	its maybe worth using a smaller box as you are shipping a lot of air !
neutral	these were not an exact_fit for my vehicle as_advertised and the picture makes them look to be a better quality than they are in reality .
positive	fd send me my glasses very fast , i got a certified card form my lends and all the options that i choose while place the order , instructions and the original box and case for my frame taghauer , so i got full warranty for authentic frame plus certicard for all options that i selected .
negative	the test of any company is not how they act when all goes_smoothly , but what they do when it starts to go_wrong .
positive	i must_admit to being surprised at the size of them as they are so tiny , but , omg , do they have sticking power !
neutral	others were ok , luckily they were on sale as i would never pay the full price for them !
negative	i had to email again and ask again and wait again and hope and pray i actually get a response !!
positive	after doing some online searching and finding chewy . com , i made some decisions and ordered two cases of nature '_s variety " instinct " in duck and rabbit .
positive	with bluehost , i found it very easy to use their cpanel for maintaining my website .
negative	he basically wasted 0 . 0 hours of his day because sparefoot didn_'_t bother to check with the facility .
negative	booked a harry_potter walking_tour in london .
positive	brilliant would recommend to anyone .
neutral	i would definitely order from them again .
negative	i was given a hassle when i turned the car in at avis because of this dent .
neutral	no i did not contact them , but i was disappointed .
neutral	i really have no use for the extra parts as i am an individual who ordered the parts for a relative .
negative	i haven_'_t received the product yet , hence i can '_t rate the service .
negative	then they came back and asked for 000_euro to cancel the contract permanently !
positive	overholder altid hvad de lover
negative	you then get an_email link to trust_pilot requesting you rate them before you have experienced the joys of their off - shore ( i '_m guessing ) customer_services .
neutral	ordered a flower_basket and wine to be delivered to my daughter as a surprise in australia .
positive	i then get at_least 0 pairs of shoes .
neutral	i send a mail with a new delivery adress , and heard_nothing for weeks .
neutral	lucky there is no competition .
negative	the did not tell me that i was going to be charged now and not when i utilize the reservation like normal businesses do , now my credit_card expects me to pay for the reservation before i have even used it .
positive	e_- spares are top_notch .
negative	" did i select right ", " sorry it '_s non_- refundable ".
positive	great tour .
neutral	the cost of selling with all the fees ,, is just getting a bit overwhelming
negative	bank info ?
positive	as anyone will tell you , when your washing_machine breaks down it '_s a nightmare .
positive	what else can a customer ask for ?
neutral	the product is a +
neutral	the shirt label that was clearly_visible behind the plastic packaging read small and so did the manufacturing printing on the package .
negative	the voucher expired i contacted customer_service as it wasn_'_t my fault and i '_m still_awaiting a reply speaks_volumes .
neutral	website dates imputed kept reverting to current date even_though correct dates shown before pressing button to pay .
neutral	staff was very friendly - i appreciate that .
positive	they found the best price for exactly_what i needed .
negative	i arranged an_appointment with their engineer to come over to my new flat on saturday since i am out of flat any other day of the week as i work in another town .
positive	great selection , great prices , i trust them more than any other photo site .
neutral	hope this keeps my id safe
neutral	i called up right_away because there was no way i was going to wait that long .
negative	first_impressions last !
positive	everything_went without a hitch .
neutral	i took it back to kwikfit who have advised there is nothing they can do as it is a problem with the alloy wheel .
negative	i would not look at this web_site again .
neutral	not the best after sales service - cumbersome arrangement with not being_able to correspond via_email including this feedback .
negative	then to have no staff available at 00 : 00 is not a great advertisement of their excellent customer service .
neutral	the print graphics are the only_thing that has lasted .
neutral	just wish it wouldn_'_t have eaten up so much of my time .
positive	the only_thing i could wish to change at vital_choice is to have a 0_oz .
neutral	their office is in ireland which is difficult to reach by phone when i live in south_america .
neutral	the only problem was the item had a slight_damage to it .
neutral	i believe they think i have a good product and therefore consider they should earn more as well .
negative	this is completely_unacceptable and i was given no_explanation for this complete and utter rubbish service other than for this new guy saying that the person_who had initially called me earlier had no_idea about their schedule and her confirmation that the appointment would take place meant nothing and could not be relied_upon !
negative	kære trine
negative	have you accepted your level of service as " pathetic "?
positive	easy to use website and came next_day very pleased and will_defiantly be using them again
negative	disputing transaction with paypal .
negative	i ordered shock mounts for a0000 chevy silverado and i have only received one .
neutral	the routes are good bit the commentary was virtually non_- existent .
positive	would thoroughly_recommend this company .
neutral	0 .
positive	the fitting_centre was not flashy but the guys were very competent unlike a recent experience at a major_chain . would definitely use both blackcircles and the fitting_centre mtmc in tonbridge again .
neutral	i care more about function than form in this particular rig , but if this was my other vehicle i ' d send it back .
neutral	the service is polite and courteous but the rate for the room is higher_than if you handle your reservation directly with the vendor .
neutral	there is a need for installment plans .
positive	we recently used book it to book a trip and it was super easy and quick .
neutral	thanks
negative	i can '_t wait to see that credited to my american_express .
neutral	the box took to . long to get here .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	then it stopped_working only after a week
neutral	i then called the facility directly to ask some further questions and was told they did not have any 0 ' x 00 ' units available , and did not understand_why we were told that they did .
negative	i arrived at the hotel to find out my reservation was invalid and that i had booked through a third_party service .
neutral	expect much_better of swedish company .
positive	that day i received an_email from petflow featuring the pet_corrector on sale so i ordered a jumbo can .
positive	thanks .
positive	pure_formulas is my favorite place to order supplements and health products on line because they do not charge shipping and handling and they mail very quickly .
neutral	and why wait for 0 days to respond to a ticket ?
positive	!
positive	placed and filled 0 of the bags and noticed a couple of days_later that 0 had a leak in it .
negative	i am really very angry with geek parts .
positive	omar is awesome !
neutral	the site explains that i should receive this in 0hrs max .
positive	i shop around for everything to get the best price .
negative	no one should have to go through the experience my family and i went through .
neutral	i want to order regularly from you , but unsure at this point if you are reliable .
neutral	can '_t i make an_appointment so i don_'_t have to spend an evening roaming around the nearby locations waiting to get into the bay ?
negative	i was using my reservation for co - workers and wasn_'_t paying for the rooms , simy wanted to reserve 0 rooms .
positive	we used tripadvisor for the first time to plan a very special trip to italy .
negative	my advice to anyone considering this company - don_'_t do it .
negative	several days since the last e_-_mail and no refund .
positive	great service , perfect treatment .
neutral	he fitted 0 nee tyres and changed my spare brand_new tyre onto the rim of my back tyre .
positive	less_than 00hrs from order to delivery .
neutral	i returned the part i ordered about a week_ago and have not heard back from parts_geek .
negative	guy kept calling in the morning when we were not available .
positive	top seller in all ways delivery and service top_class
positive	excellent prompt service always !
positive	great service !
neutral	i could feel every spring .
negative	no chocolates or wine ???
positive	i moved from west_coast to sc and struggled to find god purveyor of high end wine here .
neutral	if you need the item that is free then the slight increase in shipping is well_worth it though .
positive	very affordable
neutral	i always get great service although sometimes it just seems like people there hate their jobs or simply do not enjoy being there .
positive	i am very satisified with the quality of pink cowboy hats that i purchased for a bachelorette_party .
neutral	the search and booking process was ok .
neutral	so all in all , the website is a good place to shop for cute_clothing . just don_'_t expect it to be in one piece .
positive	the purchase was easy and the export specialist made it a breeze .
positive	partsgeek is best way to buy parts easy to find parts good prices never any trouble in any way thanks
neutral	we ordered a ring but they had to ship it undone because it was not completed in time for our engagement .
positive	then went online and ordered the ones i wanted .
negative	!
negative	i received this order on 0 - 00 and was extremely disappointed in the quality - yellow leaves , no flowers , small plants .
positive	many_thanks
positive	the design would have suffered if it was a bit off center .
negative	we have made reservations for years direct with the hotel and it is appalling to learn that this type of call immediately goes to someone_who doesn_'_t identify themselves as someone other than the hotel and they charge your card immediately . hotels charge the card when you check in which is what my expectation was .
positive	delivery was very quick and on time , liked receiving the email with exact delivery time_slot .
positive	but don_'_t believe those reviews that say negativly on the site .
negative	customerservice asures me that they have the right watch in stock and that we have no reason to worry , because they have no reason to desive us .
positive	i '_ve probably bought 00 - 00 different salts and spices from this company and they have always been fresh , flavorful & aromatic and the prices are competitive .
neutral	it has noticeable differences ( missing engraved text on the back , rippling on the screen due to finger pressure , rattling buttons ).
positive	the goods i ordered arrived swiftly
neutral	i was expecting my order to be delivered 0 - 0 business days .
neutral	fortæl i det mindste folk , hvad nummer de er i køen !
negative	a conversation in the pub last_week , " hey mark , i have this great new track i just made in my studio , its an mp0 file on my phone i '_ll send it to you via bluetooth . oh wait you have an iphone .
positive	on top of that they usually give you a couple ideas on what to mix and match with the item and i really appreciate that as i prefer to know how my clothes are actually going to fit which is why before yesstyle i was always really skeptical_about purchasing online .
positive	and the price was great as well .
negative	they sent me the wrong board , so another person was given mine .
positive	the picture on the webpage looked great , hence the order , and just what i wanted so when the goods came i was delighted that the quality was everything i could have hoped for .
positive	great 0st_class service , ordered and delivered on time , great communication_throughout , will recommend friends
neutral	i did get my glasses just in time , and they are the real product and i am very happy with them .
neutral	but if it is important that you get your glasses quicly , do not trust the fast delivery claim as it may not be accurate .
negative	secondly the way you handled whole deal was disaster .
neutral	however , the delivery by parcel_force has_been extremely disappointing .
positive	nice_touch of free chocolates with the order too , which shows how much care they place on the customer .
neutral	i didn_'_t even know that my order for a bosch_starter had gone_through until it arrived .
positive	plus they are quick .
positive	good , easy and fast service .
neutral	my fiance and i did have a number of difficulties with our order with this company ( they are listed at the very bottom of this review ), but our opinion has changed drastically since we were able to work with michael .
negative	your company stole money out of my account ?
negative	dont ever use travelocity .
negative	im so fed up with not receiving items that i paid for / always asking for the money back that they charged for them when it should be refunded automatically without me even asking and having other issues , better yet i shouldn_'_t even have this problem .
positive	already used my nail_polish .
neutral	good but why is it not possible or difficult to book seats ?
neutral	found rear_strut inserts quickly for my saab .
negative	!
positive	thanks .
positive	the only glitch was a delay in delivery - not your fault - it took royal_mail 0 days to deliver your packet by 0st_class ' recorded delivery '.
positive	then it arrives on time within a couple of days .
neutral	), so it wasn_'_t possible .
neutral	the only individual i had any contact with was quite abrupt on the phone issuing orders as though talking to a toddler .
neutral	the netsuites website is terrible .
positive	wasn_'_t dissappointed . it arrived within 0 days !!
positive	use them to book anything from hotels to hostels and i have never had an issue even when booking from their iphone_app !
neutral	the 0 . 0l engine was underpowered for the fast paced european highways and that was especially noticeable when overtaking semi '_s at > 00 km / h .
negative	white marks are random all over the paper .
positive	any idea '_s . p aduddle
positive	thanks , i would definitley use this company again .
negative	my layovers were between 0 - 0 hours and they were in small airports .
neutral	i purchase things with great shipping / return_policies and top_notch service .
neutral	therefore makes it look worth a lot less_than i paid for it !
negative	i called in that night to confirm the email and was told is was a system generated email and our flights were not booked .
positive	what more can one ask for !
neutral	in total it took 0 0 / 0 hours to pick - up our car .
negative	i order a queen_bed from them , huge mistake .
negative	( i have photos of the office and the crowds if you would like me to send them to you ) there were maybe 0 agents working and all the rest of the desks were empty .
neutral	i am pleased with them however !
positive	it was a vw part and we do not have a vw dealership nearby .
neutral	i am less_than pleased .
neutral	once again , fedex failed and did not return my phone_call .
neutral	we stayed at the thistle victoria so pick_up was just outside the hotel .
neutral	was able to use parts although some things were missing
neutral	thinking i am dealing_with the actual hotel and i '_m dealing_with a company like you online .
positive	the delivery was very fast and the glasses were well_packaged .
neutral	customer_service representative was less_than helpful when i called to ask a question about how fast the card would be loaded and available to my sister .
negative	rang back and was told the viewing card was correct .
neutral	i received an_email_confirming that my mum had received her flowers , yet a phone_call revealed that she had not received any flowers .
neutral	the jalapeno bread was good but wish their pizza was a little better !
neutral	that is something that should not have happened at all and it really ruined my day because i didn_'_t know that i was $_00 dollars down .
positive	i thought that it would probably be out of stock , that '_s what normally happens when i find a bargain , but was wrong and able to put in the order .
neutral	thankfully , i arrived at my destination just in time to keep on schedule .
neutral	which is why i had this shipped to a friend in cali , so she can send it to me from there for $_00 . 00 .
positive	i can speak to a rep quickly who_knows the product and is very helpful .
negative	what i don_'_t like , someone_else will !
negative	nej - dette har_jeg lært af flere omgange .
positive	but you must know about returning your car to a different location .
positive	lenstore are efficient and always get my order right - unlike my local_opticians .
neutral	used_usrentacar may times always give good service & price but this time they have been let_down by the us supplier budget at tampa .
neutral	i was glad i ordered light collars and clip on lights .
neutral	the parking location is poorly market and the complex provides parking for the hotel and other businesses in the same building .
negative	my wife took time off work at a cost to her .
negative	ja så nu har de mistet en kunde der eller har_handlet ved dem i 00 år som privat og nu skulle have første bestilling som erhverv .
neutral	i dont have access to a computer very much , and tried to call parts_geek and order .
negative	i asked my . mother to send me a photo . of what arrived .
negative	the rest you can call coincidence if you want but on christmas_eve , less then 0_weeks after the dispute was final and the first tim ei used my card since sept , my card was declined for a purchase .
neutral	i ordered a few parts and if the parts are on different location , you will be charge separate shipping charge for each location .
neutral	so now i shop on line instead and have found better supplements at more affordable prices .
neutral	but to come to rest after a long day of sight seeing , it wasn_'_t that bad .
neutral	so i called on wife '_s cell , got through right_away .
positive	they were very helpful , with all of our needs , during this very difficult time .

neutral	as a small business_owner , i do not have time to chase up tasks which i have allocated and paid someone_else to do .

positive	it '_s as simple as that !
negative	i banged and waited and about 00_minutes later i could see the man and young_woman ' strolling ' back …. obviously , his paycheck does not depend_on the profitability of this company .

positive	sizes are true to description , clothing looks and fits like pictured , color is as_pictured .

positive	thank_you .
neutral	i will write a review when we receive the item .
negative	also the fact that almost everything they buy comes from china !

negative	isn_'_t that interesting .
negative	don_'_t see why i have to inconvenience myself because of your mistake .
positive	and shipping was free !
positive	this was obviously a company that were confident in the products they sold and the level of service they delivered .
negative	i don_’ t have the convenience of stopping to shop after work , as the only place open to shop is wal - mart .

negative	at that time i asked the attendant about the bridge tolls .
negative	the first order was for 0 x dehumidifiers .
neutral	it was timely shipped and i was super happy about that .

neutral	the cancellation email advised that a refund would take 0 - 00 working days however on the 0th working day my bank had seen no sign of the refund and stated it should only take 0 - 0 days in their opinion , so i emailed proviation who asked me to leave it another 00 - 00_hours and they would manually escalate of not received .

neutral	after a lot of calls they located where it was and i had little time to find the place and get my package .
positive	a couple of days_later they delivered them to my home .
neutral	but there '_s a lot i could do with $_00 .
neutral	having used this kind of service twice in the last couple of months i have discovered that it is cheaper to deal directly with the motel / hotel .
negative	by their logic , i don_'_t have any credit with them , yet they refunded my order -$_00 , meaning i do have credit from the order .
negative	here is the issue in a nutshell
neutral	oh , and to top it all off , they didn_'_t cancel my friend '_s first order as he requested , so he ended_up with two keys instead of one .
positive	one buck_resume tries to draw out " stories " during the process and it made it seem so natural to use these stories in the interview process .

positive	i bought a pixma pro 000 , it arrived the next_day , but had a fault .

positive	remarkable how quickly the delivery is .
neutral	dear concerend ,
neutral	my legging has thread hanging from the zipper .
negative	the did not cut_off the line when they promised - it took them a week longer to do that .

neutral	customer_service sucks .
positive	excellent service and delivery that every online company should be capable of !
neutral	for such reasons , i now try to avoid the stress of using the website , worrying_about what condition my purchase will arrive in .
negative	one of the products i ordered is made up of very cheap parts and has already broken .
neutral	the day was a bit spoiled by the extreme speed differentials .
positive	order details were confirmed , and tracking advice clearly given .
positive	also better_than the dealer and a local parts store .
neutral	however , supplementwarehouse more than makes up for this lower price in how much they charge for shipping .
negative	it wasn_'_t .
negative	booked a trip to disneyworld .
negative	called a number of times .
neutral	after_spending over_£ 0 , 000 with the company i would really like better service when they get it wrong .

positive	even after i ' d done an initial setup myself , i was really pleased to have a phone_call from a member of the team asking how i was getting on and offering pointers on how to make the most of the system .
neutral	this occurred on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	its been 0 days and the plants are still yellow , still no flowers .
neutral	i think this may actually be looked upon as a type of ' misdemeanor ' in the business world or catalog shopping .
neutral	when i was first using this service the wait was 00_mins for car return now 00 / 00_mins seems to be the norm .
negative	a totally_unacceptable experience .
neutral	it was extremely frustrating .

neutral	we used a different credit_card and the payment did not go thru because the name on the card did not match the billing name on file .
neutral	close but no cigar .
positive	the only regret i have is that i didn_'_t know about them earlier !
positive	the price of the item was also really reasonable .
negative	no phone_number listed anywhere .

positive	i was able to order 0 toners for half the price of a new one !
neutral	also , the text that i had aligned on the computer was not aligned on the actual magnet .
neutral	service was great and once i figured the internal rail was too narrow for the slot i got a pen knife and cuticle scissors and with some cuts got the part to fit and it works as it should .
negative	ich_habe damals ein paket von gmx geschenkt bekommen , das filme , serien usw kostenlos angeboten hatte , leider gibt_es bei maxdome nun neue pakete , wodurch mein paket unnötig geworden ist , da man die filme auch als free - user kostenlos sehen kann , auch der dazu gehörige bereich ist_sehr bedürftig .

positive	if you wanna buy anything related to gaming online , pc_game_supply is the site .
neutral	experience would have been excellent if a status was emailed .
neutral	it seems that someone should have put in an ad or comment .
neutral	as tour had a few german tourist , the tour_guide was german so all commentary were in german and english . a bit long_winded so missing some of the sights while the translation is going on .
positive	a few_days went by and i recieved my correct shipment .
neutral	i was kind of put off by the whole thing because first i felt a little sketched out by " shavous " because thats not a holiday i assume you meant " shavuot " and then the original package wasn_'_t there even_though i had already begun check out when you shut the online site down .
negative	i hoped it was the correct_part & only had a different number because it was an internal office number .
negative	make_sure to look over anything you ' re planning to buy very thoroughly , i '_ve bought a few things that have been defective , only to notice after tags were cut .
neutral	very wonderful and courteous person .

positive	booked very easily and very friendly and helpfull lady on the other end
negative	it goes without saying i never got a call back or even a text .
negative	my wife made the mistake of believing that the reservation_counter website was actually the holiday_inn website that she usually uses .

positive	we love 00dollarmall
negative	okay . so they gave_me the phone_number to call expedia . com .
positive	on the internet i had looked at a number of different brands and this one stood_out .
neutral	originally i thought the service offered quite low_prices for all of my games a total of £_00 worth i decided to only sell a few of the games to music_magpie and sell the rest on ebay which turned_out to be a bad descision as for example 0 game sold for £_00 after ebay fees and paypal and postage i ended_up with £_00 which was a £ 0 loss on sale price where as music_magpie offered me £_00 for the game which had no other fees involved .
neutral	they were what i was looking for but i didn_'_t realize i could buy a kit to make them myself .
negative	i sent an_email to the person responsible for insurance and they responded with a 0 - 000 number that informed me they couldn_'_t help me since my confirmation number didn_'_t work for their system .
negative	i called and emailed customer_service to begin an exchange , per the process listed on their website .
positive	the clerk who greeted us was friendly and when we only had one bed in our room , she quickly moved us to a room with two beds .
negative	the part was " made for my car " yet the cables were much too short !
neutral	driving without a blinker is no fun .
negative	this was the 0th of october and we ' re almost reaching november and oh what a surprise .
neutral	i have ordered from them three_times .
neutral	the driver was determined evidently , because the only reason he left the parts was because my daughter was here to sign the ticket that did not need to be signed .
negative	i made a reservation thinking i was calling the sheraton .
positive	this was our first order from chewy . com and we are very pleased with the experience .
neutral	website should only provide a list of available vehicles .
positive	-
negative	off then the set button fell out removed unit from car and trashed it .
negative	because the company does not have a working phone_number or direct email , it is impossible to actually have a conversation with a representative of the company .

positive	got the item in three_days , it was the exact part i was looking for , and the price was right .
positive	communication between hunt_office and myself is always timely and appreciated .
neutral	changes to make the system easier for international visitors would have made the experience much more enjoyable .

neutral	in light of all the drama , a0skateboards . com still helped_me put a smile on my son '_s face , which in the proverbial master card phrase " priceless ".

neutral	my advise to you : do ask more before you order
neutral	it took us a long time to unpack and we were then left with a mountain of rubbish to get_rid of which resulted in two trips to the council tip .
neutral	arrived at_gatwick having phoned ahead and no_problems with the drop_off .
positive	i used this program to record webinars so i was not stuck at my computer for hours .
negative	it '_s not the fact that the missing part costs $ 0 .
neutral	hello , i originally ordered three items , and to date have only received two .
negative	even worse is that they do not have an exchange program setup so i will have to just reorder the tailight instead of them just sending me what i really need .
positive	i have used chemical '_s site several_times now .
neutral	as a 000_% disabled veteran i always get a discounted booking from hampton inns and there is apparently no place to request such discount on your website .

neutral	le " a " était interprété comme un véhicule de catégorie " a " et non comme un véhicule " automatique ".
neutral	i wish i could get a refund
positive	this site made searching for and reserving a hotel so much_simpler , and at a very good price !
neutral	looked at my invoices and noticed i had been credited with the trainers money back .
neutral	it was found that one of the pieces was defective .
neutral	part was available , shipping was prompt although i feel that shipping of the mirror switch was costly . i have ordered the side door mirrors , rear tailgate supporters and dual windshield_washer resevoir from your competition and shipping was free for ground delivery but not so with you , which will have me using your competition as my first source for parts in the future for my tahoe .
negative	the next_day we get several emails from bookit stating the flights we were assured of the night before were no_longer confirmed and that we had a price issue .
neutral	after paying page and on - line receipt both show incorrect dates .

neutral	it does not affect my vision so i did not file a claim with lensfactory , but i am giving the 0_star_rating because of the imperfection .
neutral	i do love that fact that you can earn_points and they offer great discounts so i keep using it but i also have some issues with the app .
neutral	i bought the wocher and then i noticed that the pictures that were presented in the advertisment , were from rooms that you could not book with your wocher .
neutral	i hate doing_business with vendors that overcharge for shipping and handling and avoid it whenever i can .
negative	she must know she will be a senior_citizen someday .
positive	we have just moved_into a new property which is fueled by oil , all previous properties have used the main gas supplies .
negative	i ordered these pans about two and a half weeks before christmas .
neutral	normally , this isn_'_t a big deal , but i was trying to put $ 0 on one account , and the rest on another .

positive	the preview features are wonderful .
neutral	hours_later and i have still not heard_anything . my house payment did not go through because i have no money in my account .
positive	helpful and courteous all the way through , the sort of staff_member who you should be able to get a transfer fee for if she was to leave .
negative	in the end when i said i need to leave now he said he would leave my parcel in a secure place , ( i . e after 00 . 00 ). so he got out his van and i showed him a place he could leave it , after 00 . 00 , excuse me but surely my house is the most secure place to leave it , not outside .
negative	next_day the issue on the website was fixed and still they don_'_t accept there was an_issue .
positive	the delivery was fast and uncomplicated .
negative	usually there are no_problems .
positive	levering en afwerking zoals verwacht .
neutral	i place a second order but was very disappointed . upon_receipt of 0 bags of 00 each - the total white dried cow_ears in the first bag was 0 .
positive	did i mention free_postage , free eliquid and one of the most competivelty priced products on the market its a no_brainer :)
neutral	so i often end up getting an order when i didn_'_t need anything , which is very frustrating .
negative	we got into the mini_van and found another couple and apparently because of the rainy cold_weather , it would just be the four of us for the tour .
positive	very glad to have found 0st - line .
positive	great product range .
negative	me a phone_call to simplify the error on your side .
negative	i did not know the answers , she got loud , enough for everyone to hear , and discussed why i should know these answers , and demanded that i agree with her .
neutral	the whole_ordeal ended_up costing me a lot of money : double for shipping , and more money , wasted time , and gas to locally source the part i needed instead of being_able to get one from parts_geek that should have worked right the first time . but didn_'_t .
negative	i am not saying this was intentinal or malicious , but i am not saying it isn_'_t either .
negative	i am familiar with the standard of having until 0pm or later on the day of the stay , not 00_hours before .

positive	happy dogmom .
neutral	the product also did not come with any hardware for installation .

negative	after all was done , we were stranded at the airport 0 hours from home with no transportation home .
neutral	trying to reorder labels is difficult and cumbersome on their website , its strange you can '_t access previous_orders from the account_holder page , instead you have to find a previous order number and do a search , thats really ridiculous .
negative	it wasn_'_t in my junk folder either .

positive	plus they make it easy to find what you ' re looking for , suits , sweatshirts , dresses , frills , studs , skulls , roses , you name it they probably have it !
neutral	the product came to me as_discribed and as shown , but the company needs to communicate more with the public or it is going to see more negative_comments which could easily be avoided .
neutral	the other company offer discount and free_postage which was not the case with my purchase here so slightly disappointed .
neutral	would the contact_lens prescription be listed under a different name , or is there a different location that we should contact ?

positive	i needn_'_t to have worried though .
neutral	second_pair i had to wait a further 0_weeks for them to arrive .
negative	in my case they advertised one hotel but the reservation confirmation was for another lower profile cheap hotel from the same chain .
positive	you will not find a more honest , better researched nutritional supplement product supplier .
negative	their customer_service representatives are rude and their overall level of service is terribly unsatisfactory .
positive	i will_definitely purchase from them again
negative	i triple checked the order and it was 000_% correct on my end .
positive	would be more convenient if the collection time could be more precise than 0 : 00 - 00 : 00 .

positive	ordered tuesday , goods arrived next_day -, good secure_packaging - no_issues
neutral	quick delivery of the cook cart and looks like its made from good materials but lots of washer / bolts for the fixing screws / bolts were missing and after a phone_call next_day i am still_waiting for these to arrive - have spent a week tripping over the parts that fill the kitchen_floor .
positive	i '_ve come to rely_on pure_formulas to get my supplements quickly and affordably .
neutral	a scan bar would also be helpful when the gift_card prints out since we needed to wait for a manager to override the system to hand key the number in .
positive	barrington really do have it sussed - a great range at good prices and and excellent service !
neutral	in the write up , the color was not mentioned .
negative	there was a line out the door of the building !
neutral	i really like this site , but they don_'_t always ship what you order then you have to email them to be credited for items not shipped . if you call on the phone for customer_service , plan on being on hold for an average of 00_minutes .

positive	i may be wrong and only time will tell , but it would have been better if it stayed at your last selection .
positive	always a great selection , quick shipping and very good parts .
negative	why allow ordering of out of stock items on your website ?
neutral	if it is the later than maybe you should not allow same day orders if they are over a certain_amount of items .

positive	matched competitor price after the purchase was already made !

neutral	. waiting for 00 - 00_minutes while other company has multiple cars going by is ridiculous !
positive	friendly banter by me was returned in kind and in the spirit in which it was intended .
neutral	you should get a 0_stars as it relates to doing what you promised .
neutral	it is not worth the price .
positive	i was also leery that myimeiunlock was writing their own reviews but in the end , i took a chance and it was exactly as_promised .
neutral	hard to hear reservation rep . found out call_center was not a marriott center but an expedia center .
negative	i got charged for amount on my visa immediately and it was not told to me .

neutral	i think someone mismarked the shirts .
positive	if i have to continue wearing compression hose by doctor '_s orders , i will order another pair .
neutral	they where quick to pick_up the items , which i was impressed about , but where abit slow iin payment and could do with improving communication with customers ( eg emails on whearabouts etc ). i would use this service again though .
neutral	phone_number should be passed on to the delivery company in future to avoid such problems .
positive	that '_s why i only buy games from shopto . net without_fail i have received all orders on the release_date and with any luck my psvita will not just arrive as one of the best deals online but ontime .
neutral	very few people around .
negative	i have had no_problems with this firm after years of buying until i met the delivery driver from hell slamming my door shut and telling_me to [ f ] off , i have contacted bosses at 0000r . p . m but they have not returned my calls and seem to be standing with him , i will never be shopping there again until i have at_least had an explanation re drivers behaviour now i get a response a week_later , but 0 hour after my review , but they say driver does not work for them but delivers their goods , people beware of this company who supports and lets complete strangers call at your door without_any kind of checks on them and give you any abuse because they will say he dosnt work for us [ watch this driver on [_link ] soon ] and you judge ,.

neutral	once again he promised to send the data .

neutral	i received the product ordered in a timely_manner without_any fuss , but when package arrived the product packaging looked like it went thru the war .
positive	using selectspec . com this was far cheaper_than any high_street optician or supermarket optician .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a problem to be sorted dispute contacting you twice !
positive	if i am need for something like this again i will_definitely use bottleyourbrands . com without a doubt .
negative	i wish i have read_reviews of this company before i signed_up with them !

negative	trying to book another person onto the same flight takes them 00 + minutes for them to turn_around and say it was unsuccessful and to book it myself online ( at 00ppm not acceptable !!!!)

neutral	she said i can return it but i have to pay 00_% restocking_fee and shipping cost .
neutral	but be careful of the images !
negative	i was just waiting for delivery .

neutral	my biggest concern was the attitude of the clerk at the rental desk .
neutral	postage and vat = £_00 . 00 , a bit of a false sense of cost when first entering the website .
neutral	so , the girl google mapped directions and printed it out for me and gave_me several maps .
negative	i paid over $_00 to send the sub - standard part back to them .
neutral	thanks .

negative	had to wait 0_weeks for them to investigate the where abouts of my purchase , and as they are not contactable via phone , only email , just makes the process even more frustrating !
negative	when they finally did get an engineer to replace the meter they stopped validating any meter readings on my account and it took massive effort to get them to do anything !

negative	this is the worst delivery company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	now they won_'_t even respond to my requests for a status_update !.
neutral	then you try to re book a different flight then you have to fill in all the information again .
neutral	price was right for item i wanted but bad forms can be a tie breaker for future orders .

neutral	software trial_period had expired when purchased so i could not use the software right_away .
positive	i did a lot of research before i bought my larder_fridge and freezer , the choice of products was far greater than most retailers and i got them at a greater discount because i bought them together and saved £_000_pounds on the next cheapest retailer for the same product , and if i wanted to i could have gone and viewed them in their show room , the service was excellent i was kept_fully_updated on my order given a date and approx time_slot upon ordering and even received a text with the drivers names , and then a further phone_call to say that they where only twenty mins_away on the day of delivery .

neutral	i was disappointed that the paperwhite narcissus that i ordered for a gift too so long to arrive ( which could easily have been due to the cold_weather in january ), but more disappointed that it failed to bloom .
neutral	everything fine until i opened the package and saw " taiwan " on the front of the dust cover .

negative	as an individual who travels frequently finding a reliable parking service is important .
neutral	jeg mener det_er problematisk at jeg først kan se om jeg overhovedet kan få tingene sendt_til mig når det_er jeg_er ved at betale .
neutral	i am aware that buying online may mean the colours vary but the same image was used to show the bedding on the actually product packaging which is very misleading .
neutral	that was fantastic !!!

positive	i would recommend this to the world !
positive	picked_up my clubs from my home and delivered them ahead of time for a very reasonable price .

negative	i made a reservation for 0 nights .
negative	their email response was to issue a rma_number allowing the return - at my expense .
neutral	i received my order in a reasonable amount of time after i ordered it , but the two 00 packs of canned_food i ordered were at_least 00_% comprised of dented_cans .
neutral	it was actually located in a mountain_home of a different state , so i did not go_ahead with that transaction .
neutral	the crowd of people waiting there was so big that not everybody got a seat and the situation got worse as the journey carried on , people were complaining of overcrowding in the downstairs area and as it was such a hot day it was blisteringly hot in that section too .
negative	i am very disgruntled with this company .
neutral	the 0_star_rating is simply because the cost of the service was greater than the face value of the cards , but , hey , it '_s christmas and my shopping is done !
neutral	it is unlikely i will be ordering in the future from rush order_tees for our company '_s needs as i feel as though $_000_+ was wasted on products that have proven to be inadequate for our needs .

neutral	everything is ok .
neutral	i am not unhappy with the service or product but to pay considerable postage only to have the item damaged because it had not been put in packaging correctly would make me think_twice about buying online from this company again .
neutral	i always expect a dented can or 0 depending_on how many i buy ,. but ; out of 00 cans over half were dented & many of them bad enough that i had a really hard time opening them : however , they were not " bloated ", and so_far i haven_'_t come_across any compromised seals , & the packaging ( padding ) was acceptable , & the plastic over the bags was in good shape .
neutral	if you really spend a few min . s too look on the site , you will find some decent deals , however , i was expecting more wholesale type of prices . also i got billed on the 00th this mth , but as of today , the 00st , still no pet_food :/ so you have to gauge the days by at_least approx .

negative	they shipped the wrong color panel ( pn : 000 - 000 / tan ) and now they expect me to pay for return shipping .
neutral	also , i did not feel it was worth the $_00 as_advertised but i was not familiar with those food items and my cats can '_t eat a lot of different foods ( like most ) or they will get upset tummies .
neutral	still bought the product since it was a good price for it , for what i needed .

neutral	the cat_food bag has already been opened & the weight of it to ship back would be too much .

neutral	i recently had to purchase different dog_food as my pet was not eating good . in the meantime i recieved another order from petflow upon contacting them as to what to do with this shipment it has_been four days and i have still heard_nothing . today they sent me this survey . and no answer to my problem . so this is my opinion . during my business with petflow . i found it difficult to change orders because in doing so , you cancel out your next order and need to wait for the one after that . i was always running_out of food , and had to go to the store which is quite a distance from my house . that '_s why i went to petflow , however , sometimes it was a convenience and sometimes it was a hassle .

neutral	the rinse racks were shipped and delivered but not to my address .
negative	wait . what ?
neutral	still your company is selling service .
negative	i don_'_t think 0 more days ( for a total of 00 days ) is going to make a difference .
negative	the agent charged me $_000 . 00 without authotization to expedia .
neutral	so i assume it '_ll eventually increase with more business .
neutral	i need it to work when i need it .
negative	seems like a lot of items get lost for some reason , but since they couldn_'_t just resend my $ 0 . 00 order on the spot , i don_'_t think they ' re too worried_about customer retention , so i '_m done with that site .
negative	do not order anything from them now i am disputing it with my credit_card company .

positive	many_thanks
neutral	i do think though that they should be better about what '_s actually in stock and what '_s not .
neutral	the 00 cans of dog_food were packed on the bottom of the box , shrink wrapped together in a smaller carton .
neutral	my only_gripe . and this isn_'_t directly solely to this company in particular but to all of the mainland company '_s i tried before going with you .
positive	thank_you !

neutral	i had two problems - spoofing your google_voice number from your phone_power account is not a good idea .

neutral	unfortunately both_times animals have chewed into the package to get the dog_food .
positive	requested " eco " free delivery .

neutral	very cheaply_made for price .
negative	thanks for the horrible service !
negative	sure enough , i stepped back and the employee came around the corner still pushing the alarm button .
negative	one star includes rude conduct which was not there .
positive	so it fell to me to attempt the booking of a hotel in nottingham .
negative	and again price is way too high and higher .
positive	the fitter_turned_out on a wet and cold morning but he was cheerful and quickly fitted my two new tyres without_any_problems .
neutral	then when i got it i discovered it was the wrong bag .

neutral	i understand that the company are trying to go green but wouldn_'_t it be better for everybody if they dispossed of the rubbish responsibly considering the money that the customer is paying .
positive	i really liked the finished_product .
negative	apparently they still can '_t find my hotel or flight that i booked in their system .
neutral	on the other hand , they have jersey '_s listed over a $_000 more then i would pay ( on sale - same jersey ), at my regular cycle shopping website , so not exactly outlet pricing !

neutral	we had reserved an automatic and got a lovely upgrade to a terrific volvo : we loved our car .
neutral	my complaint would be that the food is about $ 0 -$ 0 more than at a local_retail_store , and add to that the shipping ( don_'_t like to spend the extra $$ on stuff i don_'_t need just for free_shipping ), sooooo , all together i pay nearly $_00 extra for home delivery .

positive	i like that they ' re always friendly knowledgable and don_'_t feel_like sales people .
negative	i am not making this up .
neutral	i am not a person to complain however i have found online shopping frustrating at times .
negative	when i first made the purchase , the glasses i chose were " in stock ".

negative	will be able to comment further at the end of the trip .

negative	i have been ordering from 0 sites for renting_textbooks , the only one i have issues with is bookbyte .
neutral	postage charges are too high though , if you ever have to reutrn an item due to sizing problems you will wasily pay an extra £ 0 on top of the original purchase price .
neutral	i spoke with another employee ( i think karen ) who said my exchange would be processed and the smaller glasses would be shipped immediately .

neutral	i contacted main_faucet twice about this and they were ' supposed to get back to me ' about it both_times .
positive	i would highly_recommend big_bus_tours .
positive	win - win .
neutral	there have been occaisions where £_00 items being sold for £_00 were dubious - on receiving , they would never have commanded £_00 and its obviously a mechanism to create interest in a low quality product .
negative	i terminated the contract and lost everything i put down , a months worth of insurance plus i had to pay for the stupid diagnostics test because drive time nor their warranty company would pay for it .
positive	i will recommend you to anyone_who needs translations done !!

negative	call customer service - no answer , the only correspondence was through emails ( which took days ).
negative	j ' ai déjà passé des commandes sur_ce site ras
neutral	the on - line ordering_process behaved unexpectedly and it looked like i might have placed an order , then lost it .
neutral	crack on lens at bottom was disappointing but not worth trying to hassle returning and waiting another month for replacement during this christmas_rush .
neutral	also , one of the color cartridges apparently leaked in the plastic container so i didn_'_t even open it .
positive	i was very pleased with the result .
neutral	on the whole , our experience was positive with regard to performance , unsatisfactory with regard to communication , and ok with regard to cost .

positive	she also helped_me with the color of led lighting i would like .
negative	received an_email_confirming a reservation i never made , or wanted .
neutral	i thought ok maybe it will come tomorrow , well tomorrow never came .
negative	as a result , i couldn_'_t recommend this company to anyone .
positive	goods dispatched the following_day and arrived the next .
neutral	i use printerinks for all my domestic needs but feel the loyalty to me could be better .
negative	companies like amazon would never have shipped the wrong order to begin with , and would never expect customers to wait a month to be credited for their mistake .
neutral	update_: the case did arrive later on monday .
positive	consiglitissimi
negative	i finally gave up , ate the cost of the part and will never shop there again !!
neutral	weren_'_t they holding what they had of my order ????

neutral	they couldn_'_t locate my reservation .
negative	i ordered some items from part geek and some of the parts came as expected , however i also ordered some diesel injectors for $_00 . 00 and i got an_email_saying they refunded my injector order , however the next_day they had the same injector for $_00 !
negative	they have apologised , promised to put right the mistake and offered £_00 as a goodwill_gesture , which is welcome but i would rather have avoided all of the time , hassle , effort and sheer frustration involved in getting them to treat me fairly in the first place !

positive	nemt at_bestille og betale .
positive	delivery is fast and prompt .
neutral	the quality you get at the end of the day is fine by material but not very good in the way it is manufactured .
negative	this was perhaps the worst customer service experience i have ever had in my life .
positive	there was such a great selection of card types to choose from that really helped with the occasion of the gift_card .
positive	i like the products i '_ve received and the service is excellent .
negative	it has taken an unacceptable length of time for these tyres to finally fitted .
positive	i purchased an ej safety_razor and a sample_pack of de blades .
positive	excellent .
neutral	a button fell_off one dress as soon as i tried it on .
neutral	so much extra fabric looks hand made not frm a actual store . no tags cricket hemline just not wat i expected
positive	it is fast and they has so much information available .
negative	if you call there regular number some guy_named buster answers saying he is away from his desk to leave message , but then you find out that his message service is full , so i went to my bank and we are doing this the legal way , and they have so many days to get my refund to me or have legal actions take agaisnt them .
negative	this service came up when i searched online for a specific hotel and the web address and 0 - 000 number led me to believe i was reserving at that hotel .
negative	i saw nothing indicating that before i placed my order .

negative	the travelocity website posted " free & flexible cancellation .
neutral	i trie dthe number the other day and it was ao .
negative	you are only made aware of this by the fact the invoice you receive has a danish address .
neutral	my problem however was with dpd the courier service chosen for delivery .
neutral	i was not approached once in regard to finding things , but overall the deal i got over rode the service i got .
negative	third , the returning the core experience is something of this world - the customers have to baby sit the process .
neutral	i put serious and important feedback to you today and , because it took time to think through and compose , you ' timed me out ' saying i should start all over again .
negative	it is very disappointing that i spent $_00 to receive the wrong product .
negative	then was told would take a week to get my refund .
neutral	i was pressed for time and the use of my cell_phone would have made the transaction much_simpler and faster .
neutral	have been pleased with some of my orders but not others , i cannot_fault the service you offer especially with free returns , i would recommend your company to friends
neutral	however , the item was very good value and will keep until christmas !
positive	well_done !
positive	my wife has spent hundreds of pounds on glasses in the past and will now definitely buy her next pair from selectspecs . com .

positive	my dog_bone lights came .
negative	i did all i can on my end .
negative	i double_checked to make_sure that this would not be too late to cancel , but was assured that it would be fine .
negative	far too often parts_geek does not respond to their emails .
positive	she did this and my order was with me in no time and i got the flat sorted and " tenant ready " in time .
positive	a great service to avoid worrying_about traveling with your golf equipment .
negative	nor did the viagogo website or packing_slip with the tickets indicate a change in date .
neutral	even_though we did have three other acceptable booking after that first bad_experience , i doubt that we will use housetrip again .
positive	i no_longer have to load the heavy_bags into the cart then into the car then into the house .
neutral	not quite as good as groupon but getting there .
neutral	by the way ink spot has no more discount shopper dockets - your spot has_been taken over by wholesaletoner . com . au
positive	if you are responsible and can read instruction then this site & it '_s products are for you !!
neutral	when i arrived , i felt that i was being spoken to like they were drill sargents .
neutral	my car is only in the bay for 00_mins tops ?
negative	now i am struggling to get a refund from auto_europe .
positive	neither of us was too happy about the extra $ 0 . 00 charge to get the $_00 psn credit but i put in the code and it worked like it was suppose to .
negative	i no_longer use phone_power .
positive	i was simply looking for a hotel that was clean , convenient and family friendly .
negative	their ' reasoning ' of not replying is because there was a " week long holiday " in their country .
neutral	forced to collect from central town post_office several miles_away rather_than local post_office .
negative	just a thought .
negative	it hasnt arrived yet !!
positive	i would highly_recommend this type of car purchase .
positive	will be ordering through the site again for my organic personal care needs .

positive	first_class company , well informed all the way and fast delivery a +++
negative	so i know have to waste more of my time calling back to get a refund !

negative	this has_been the worst online order i had ever_encountered .
neutral	i waited for six_months at_least some things !

positive	!
neutral	they are always so crowded and you wait so long .
neutral	lots of diy sticky velcro ( just one way ) so dissimilar to the evoque !

negative	i asked for a refund once again because i am tired of the crap and then he said oh it shipped out yesterday but two_days_later there is still no tacking number or anything .

neutral	however , the color i ordered was a purple and the lettering color when it came was pink .
negative	although it was a sunday and most of the shops were closed , he dropped us off on a main street to window shop for a half_hour and then picked us up and took us to versailles .
positive	fantastic .
neutral	not the same category .
positive	it '_s an american company that has_been in business for decades .
negative	this call lasted 00_minutes and resulted in their determination that it was booked through_travelocity legacy .
negative	however , expedia , would not refund me the money and told me that their policy does not match the airline policy .
positive	parts were shipped quickly and were packed with care .
neutral	i only received shipping confirmation with a tracking_number for 0 of the cards .
positive	we cannot get these sizes in canada and we appreciate your service !
positive	she liked it very much and even asked for seconds , which she usually dose not get , but for a special treat and because she asked so nicely , i gave her some !
neutral	the other 0 / 0 " sucks " - it was sent usps from clear across the country and after 0 . 0_weeks i am still_waiting ( says s / b delivered by tomorrow ).
negative	they appear to have no additional info , thus rendering a call to them when u are often passed to voicemail after hanging on for ages utterly pointless .
negative	imagine the shock when we got an obstructed view we weren_'_t told about a lifeboat to look at on a fully booked cruise .
positive	looking for this hard - to - find panasonic lens , ( some retailers said they wouldn_'_t have it for months ) panasonic sent me to digitalrev .
positive	envirophone kept me updated with e_-_mails detailing progress in our transaction , a kind of step by step_guide through the whole deal .
positive	googled what i wanted , found it here , at the best price and with no delivery charge and what '_s more , despite living in a fairly remote part of scotland delivery was very speedy !
neutral	room was fine , although the bathroom door looked like someone kicked it in .

negative	____________
negative	( as for the missing item we regret to inform that we were not be able to fulfill the remainder of your order .
neutral	upon ordering the unit , it would have been customer friendly for the sales_staff to follow through on cross - selling - skills .
positive	i would recommend for future needs in storage_locations
positive	--
neutral	then suddenly , a full year later right on christmas , they sent me a letter threatening legal_action - pretty rude considering i ' d thought i ' d already paid in full and there had been no previous contact .

positive	i didnt believe him until i compared everything i order monthly and realized i was paying wayyyyy too much money .
neutral	00_hours_later the mistake was corrected on your parts list , but i still wasn_'_t satified with the wrong part i received and i ; m not going to pay the shipping to send it back because it easn '_t my mistake .
negative	their is no customer service at all !
neutral	so the hold is pretty_much useless , unless you pay right_away the unit can go just like that .
neutral	apparently your system is such that the order does not get to the vendor until 00 - 00 min before the order is scheduled .
neutral	even it there was just a thinner piece covering that area .
neutral	it was real quick and i will use them agin in the further .
negative	the part they list for my specific vehicle is incorrect .
negative	at the end of my booking , i was informed that the order would not be processed and i assumed it was because it was a debit visa , not a credit_card visa .
positive	in addition , i found an online price that was $_000 cheaper_than tft '_s and he was able to match it .
positive	they have so much to chose from its amazing !
positive	website easy to order from , and delivery was prompt .

neutral	however , i was dismayed to find that two ( 0 ) of the three ( 0 ) parts ordered were incorrect and now i must initiate an_rma to get the right parts .
negative	depsite the fact the company concerned has done nothing wrong .
positive	i am so happy with them .
neutral	however part of the item was damaged , to be fair i got a 00_% refund very promptly once i emailed them , however maybe they could rethink their packaging .
positive	the cost is either equal or lower_than anyone_else , i know when i order something either parts or supplies for my pool , i know it will be shipped fast and i get it in a few_days .

neutral	emailed to see if not too_late to amend or .

negative	not his place and ultimately reducing the business profit of your company and service .
negative	i informed them that i would be flying out to greece in the early hours of 00 / 0 / 00 .
positive	would do_business with them again .
positive	low price and shipping right to your door works for me !
neutral	the slipper socks were the exact style i wanted and the right material - terry cloth .
negative	it was not the color described / pictured online - at all .
neutral	shipping rates should be cheaper .
positive	best airline i have ever used
neutral	therefore i could not use my old phone and had no phone service .
negative	sent the wrong damn part , it was 0 days late and the best part . it was sent in a 0ft box !!!!!
neutral	when i mail them they said that they want a bank_statement that shows that 0000 was charged and when i send them they say that the 00 eur is a bank fee !!!!!!
positive	the glasses fit well and are just what i needed .
neutral	although i '_m happy with the pieces i purchased i '_m not sure i would recommend the shop to my friends .
negative	they finally get the refund right , only now , they send totally different parts that i never ordered , in place of the parts that they never delivered in the first order .
neutral	my dog_loves the food , however the delivery truck has delivered the last 0 times to the incorrect_address .

neutral	i called customer service and asked if they can send me 0 blank envelopes .
positive	he was making us travel all the way back to accomodate his mistake ( it was easily an_hour drive , round_trip ).
neutral	if they run out of a product and are unable to send one to you , they do not inform you of this until after the product was due to be delivered and the staff are not very helpful and can come_across slightly rude .
neutral	on our visit to dreams a lovely young_man served_us .

positive	i would deal with cult_pens again and would recommend them .
neutral	when we got to park lane we were suddenly told that the tour was finishing there and i think that just because of the sheer amount of people complaining on the bus they had to finish driving the whole route .

neutral	once again , i called to get a status_update .
negative	i returned both the dresses and one of the tops .
neutral	not impressed with service of company .
negative	in fact , a manager accused me of having received the item and lying about it !
negative	da_jeg giver udtryk for min mening på_en venlig måde bliver jeg endda talt nedladende til af flere ekspedienter .
neutral	i have quite large shoulders and big armpits so i do get hot very quickly and i seem to sweat throughout the day at the office and not in short periods , i think this product would be fine but my issue is a bit more potent than this top can solve so im_gonna try and combine some products and hope for the best !

positive	it offers the highest_quality glasses at the lowest_prices .
positive	the extra_cost is well_worth it and the free_shipping on larger orders was the final drawing card .
negative	the hotel ( somehow ) links - i guess - to reservation_counter which is a " pay now " service for the booking .
positive	then i had another question , same quick response - and polite as well .
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	i ordered ( 0 ) pairs of tiffany glasses , they arrived so stretched out to the point that they wouldn_'_t even fit / stay on my head !

neutral	price competitive shame about delivery driver who said " he hadnt got time to piss about " when delivering my garden furniture and left it wedged in my gateway promptly got back in his lorry and did indeed " piss off "!
neutral	returns process is not the most user_friendly .
neutral	the lenses were put in a box that is bigger_than an average letterbox .
negative	the hotel basically said we ' d have to call " expedia " to work it out .
positive	the quality is great , reproduces depth nicely .
negative	my $_000 + order was shorted two pressure gauges .
negative	their prices are very good , unquestionably some of the cheapest around , however , once the order is accepted it all rather falls apart .
positive	there is nothing to beat having your car ready and waiting for you within a stone '_s throw of the arrival lounge .
negative	ok - so they ' d wrapped my item in a bit of bubble_wrap .

positive	tyres working well ( although they have only been on the car for a few_days ).
neutral	recently i made 0 orders , they were accepted then two of them were out of stock .

negative	i go to autopartswarehouse . com and asked them if they would price match and they do !
negative	i went to my account with my reservation details where i should have been able to change my reservation from 0 rooms to 0 rooms .

neutral	i ordered a light fitting for undershelves in our study , i quoted the exact number on the fitting but when it arrived it was not compatible possibly having been modernised over the years .

negative	i got the car , 0 days_later it started turning off on me when i called them because they said if i have any_problems just bring it in anytime well i had to make an_appointment to bring the car in which wasn_'_t for a few_days so i was left with out a working vehicle .

positive	that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions ; that is to say , that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up !
positive	i would not_hesitate to order from them again .
positive	my only food for thought would be and this may be a stretch is do warehouse to warehouse shipping so i can have a better shipping rate rather_than from c & b_& f and before you know it 00 or 00 in shipping_charges even the extra wait for package would out weight the cost to me .
positive	the envelope comes very fast and so does the payment .

positive	they always have competitive prices but the fast shipping is usually what convinces me to push the " place order " button !
neutral	call your number occasionally to see what your customers are experiencing and tweak accordingly .
negative	i asked to talk to a supervisor and was put on hold for several more minutes .
positive	plain and simple : this site has prices that are definitely lower_than chegg , bookrenter , and of course your campus book store .
negative	it is in the middle of a big city , not in a farm .
positive	exceptional service .
negative	so i called back at 0 : 00 am , when their offices should have been open and i got a message that said , " due to unforeseen_circumstances , our customer_service office is closed ."
neutral	like i said maybe i was just tired but .

neutral	maybe , not sure .
positive	great product range , latest_trends , fast delivery , easy shopping_experience .
neutral	the product was correct but disappointing to find out the free shipping is false .
neutral	in view of the way insurance companies try to avoid paying claims if all info hasn_'_t been given , i ' d say be very wary if you have anything medical to declare as the screening people don_'_t seem to know what they ' re doing .
negative	they are not happy with the outcome .
neutral	just improve your comunication , confirmation , and updates to customers , im not sure if ill return , i felt very mistreated as a customer who is spending 000 bucks !

negative	they were trying to send a pickup call_tag for the damage i have not received .
negative	they altered genuine meter readings in their favour , ( of course ), and then refused to accept the facts until threatened with the police being called in to investigate serious & organised fraud !
negative	after 0_weeks of no updates , i started emailing them every week .
positive	i have used the site before and found it very easy to navigate .
negative	i placed an order for obaby mini mouse retro buggy on the 00th - 00 - 00 rang them on 00 / 00 / 00 and was told it will be delivered monday00 , waited in allday , no buggy , rang tuesday only to be told they had none left in stock and i would have to be refunded , they oviously had them in stock when they took the money out of my account . will never order from them again and the staff arent very helpful as all they ever tell you is no body is available on customer_services .
neutral	quality is questionable at times , perhaps at times , it has to do with the cell_phone system in the philippines .
neutral	the sale has_been ending ( complete with countdown clocks etc ) and been extended several_times - this causes customers to rush and panic buy when there was never any intention to end the sale , a bit crafty .
neutral	be aware that housetrip gives hosts sometimes up to 00_hours to fix issues , so you could be stuck in a substandard apartment for up to that long as we were .

neutral	but too expensive , especially with the extra_charge for hawaiians .
negative	i tried_contacting them thru their service number w_/_c went directly to their voice_mail .
negative	in the meantime i shall flood the social_media outlets with this negative rant in hopes they are concerned_about their reputation .
positive	the ordering process was easy to navigate , and the delivery was prompt .
negative	just an awful experience .
negative	ridiculous !!
negative	i then try to return only to find that i pay the return shipping too , almost as much as i played for the crappy merchandise .

neutral	i haven_'_t had a chance to use their phone service , yet .
neutral	i wanted two copies and had to place two_separate_orders .

positive	i have always gone for free delivery and on each_occasion have received a recorded_message to say the approximate time of delivery ( usually a four hour_slot ) and then the actual deliver driver will call to say exactly_what time he will be arriving .
neutral	it looked like it had been designed for a full bottle of whisky rather_than a miniature .
negative	that is not acceptable !!
negative	wednesday emailed them 00 times , and sent them the same fax 0 times !
neutral	i went to pep_boys to get the lower hose and replaced the upper hose .
neutral	navigate website easy .
negative	no offer to allow me to continue with the option i chose ( pay later ), no offer to look for other hotels , etc . the individual was only focused on me keeping the booking , when i got no where and no offer of assistance , i immediately requested that the booking be cancelled .
neutral	makes it very hard to use all the features of the car , becomes trial and eroor and time_consuming process

neutral	they have a wide_variety of wound care products at good prices .
positive	fast shipping , great service .
negative	and i '_m a good client , i spent more than 00 . 000_€ in a year and they sent me most of what i ordered , even if it took 0 months for some !
positive	it actually infuriated me that a company would treat any employee that way .
negative	unprofessional and uncaring after i fully explained everything .
negative	website advertised semi_- aniline leather .
negative	in order to make up my size they toof 0 standard length filters and basically cut the edge off of one to make the correct size width .
neutral	i know i used ground_shipping but i think parts should be here by now .
positive	the staff were highly helpful in answering my questions over the years .
neutral	this works as long as there are no_problems then it becomes complicated and costly .
neutral	i paid €_00 per luggage whilst with the direct flight company it was €_00 .
positive	transactions were dealt_with quickly .
negative	no returns !
positive	will use it again .
neutral	thx tony belisle
neutral	i comes sometimes handy .
positive	steve
negative	it is odd how they don_'_t have a customer service phone_number / line and you have to go and " chat " on their website if you have issues .
neutral	later i received an e_-_mail_stating that my order was cancelled because of a backorder .
negative	dato :
positive	petflow saves_me time ( a precious commodity ) and costs nothing more than what i was paying at petsmart .
positive	the response time was exceptional for the initial_contact and for the necessary follow - ups .
negative	so when i ask for a full_refund of $_000 they refer me to there refund policy which says i can '_t exchange prescription_glasses , but if they weren_'_t prescription i had 0 days to ship the item back to hong_kong , at my expense , and exchange them for something else if they arrived in good condition .

negative	when i got my email_confirmation i noticed he had booked me at the wrong hotel !!!
positive	just had a water leak in my basement - threw away $ 0000 worth of ruined soaked carpet .
negative	if you like getting_ripped_off , never allowing any sort of communication , having your account suspended when ever they feel_like it .
positive	however , if you don_'_t have a lot of time to research the price , this site has always been among the top three ( e . g_., cheapest ) of the ten sites i use to reserve a car .
neutral	was offered a better price than paid due to not being sent returns pack .
negative	order process slow
negative	i will never do_business with them again .
negative	absolute joke to communicate with your company .
negative	i was impressed .
negative	however , my shipping changed to 00 day with cavalear attitudes and nonchalant approach to my issue .
neutral	the only_thing i don_'_t like is that sometimes the descriptions provided by the hotels and reviews by readers is not accurate .
positive	a very good product , easy online shop , good communication and quick delivery - thank_you
positive	i '_ve never had any_issues with shipping or products and i '_m always excited to see a package from them in my mailbox :)
negative	my neighborhood has plenty of shared mail boxes for parcel deliveries so i doubt they couldn_'_t fit two stickers in one of them , if not my personal mailbox , and i didn_'_t get any notice for pickup .
negative	the part they sent wasnt even close to the one that came out of the car , it was like they sent the wrong part on purpose then made it as hard as they could to return hoping that i would give up thinking that a $_00 part wasnt worth the hastle
negative	my new life mission is to tell all how they suck !!!!!
negative	i don_'_t even think they are a legitimate company .
negative	why should i pay for the goddamn shipping if it does not arrive until a month later ?
positive	not only was the service great , but i was able to get a very high_quality ring at a much_lower price than any retail_store .
negative	i read at_least 00 others with the sane complaints and they all day horrible customer service .
negative	00 / 0 / 00 update_:
positive	i didn_'_t know that the socket were included so emailed them and they got back with me right_away .
positive	placed order and the following_morning the stamp arrived exactly as requested .
neutral	as we were renting the car for a month this was unacceptable .
neutral	often times these parts don_'_t even fit the application , and i don_'_t bother with returns .
positive	would buy from again !
positive	went on smooth .
negative	summarizing my experience from working with you was very bad even more as i explained in the beginning i feel_cheated .
negative	called , no answer .
neutral	overall the quality of the coffee is good , maybe not quite as good as nespresso '_s .
positive	she was knowledgeable and very easy to talk to and deal with .
positive	i ordered my oil on line and bj quoted the price and a delivery window .
negative	the good point is that they cancelled the credit_card payment as well .
neutral	rent og pænt .
neutral	blah , blah .
positive	their prices and delivery are near_impossible to beat .
negative	i really deserve a refund or credit from this company .
neutral	honestly , i probably_won_'_t order a part online again .
neutral	my $_00 coupon was now only worth $_00 .
positive	fast .
negative	don_'_t know yet how can i rate you when i still_haven ; t received my order ?
neutral	if it weren_'_t for the difficulty turnning on / off they would be great .
positive	both wheels were balanced and fitted for an_additional_fee of £ 0 . oo which was good value .

negative	i had ink leak out over the place .
negative	but is reject .
neutral	the sight is very user_friendly until you get to the shipping portion .
positive	thanks
negative	ordered two_pairs of tickets for depeche mode this weekend in paris , first pair arrived no problem , although they were ordered second .
negative	the airline said that you are always doing this , sorry to see you are not being honest
negative	i finally email them and there only response is they are checking but have no_idea when it will come in .
negative	i made it clear that my husband and i would be traveling with a bag each and although we were up for a small - ish car , we would need to transport ourselves and our_luggage for a week .
negative	she asked me to wait a couple of days for the second one to turn up , so i did and no luck .
neutral	but not the cat tee .
negative	selectspecs will not inquire with usps to find the source of the delay .
neutral	at_least twice i was notified all things were shipped , but when opening was told no - ' such or such was unavailable ' and that they do not backorder .
negative	i received an_email back that basically told me they had no_idea what i was talking_about .
negative	so i will be disputing the charge with my credit_card company and never doing_business with them again .
positive	i always check them before anywhere_else .
neutral	they sent me an_rma to return them , my problem is it cost me $_00 to return them .
neutral	some things are very delayed in delivery or indeed do not arrive at all ( not a dpd problem if they are not receiving the goods ) i have cancelled a number of items because i was fed up with waiting for them and then noticed the site was running the same products again ( that did not make any sense )
neutral	all was great .
positive	having said that , priceline '_s model is different that a typical booking site and there are situations that i don_'_t book thru it .
neutral	it makes the ticket request useless .
neutral	hi i order dis item last wed and i haven_'_t received it yet i need it for friday nyt cheers
positive	they were exactly_what i ordered and well_packed .
neutral	when i finally got my laptop back , i couldn_'_t even turn it on .
positive	we drove in with a flat_tire and they were able to take us right_away .
negative	not !
neutral	they were delivered propmptly .
neutral	the solid appearance of the furniture was let_down by flimsy handles .
negative	the hotel i requested had a room when i called direct , so that will be my next route .
neutral	well i waited two_days for a tracking_number and finally called to see what was going on .
neutral	it is only the mirror that vibrates , not the mirror mount , so the quality of the backing plate fastener to the mirror adjustment motor is the culprit , but i forgive that .
neutral	the black is alright .
negative	after saying they would look into it and give me feedback within 0 business days , i never_heard from them again .
neutral	the car itself is clean and well_maintained .
neutral	cant_beat the prices they have a wide_selection of parts definitely well stocked it there were additional money saving perks possibly i dont want to sound greedy but hey why not offer shipping discounts would score five_stars but the shipping is god awful i should say the packaging everything usually is on time it just seems like either they got children , really lazy people , or monkeys that package the parts i actually laugh when i see the package and laugh even harder saying things like how did that possibly make it here or how did they make it fit or are you effin kidding me for example when a set of rotors came in they came in a nearly empty oversized_box bouncing off each other the entire journey to me i assumed by the look of them they are coated with a paint btw so it was obvious ( zimmerman rotors ) it wont stop me from buying from them but thats because i take risks and dont have tons of dough

neutral	product : vw polo a /_c a ou équivalent .

positive	my husband is disabled and i think he had kinked the shower_hose stopping the water flow causing the safety device to blow .
positive	i shop at amiclubwear frequently .
neutral	i also don_'_t like the sponsored jobs at the top and bottom of the page .
positive	they always have what we need at a good price
neutral	i had to wait_until the office opened to have my code reset .
neutral	i also paid for 0 day shipping and it was 0 days getting to me , not sure if that was a pro_world issue or the shipping company .
negative	these_cowboys are just unbelievable .
neutral	not yet received item so cannot do review . with the bank_holidays i am still_waiting for my items .
positive	the second time , i sort of knew my way around , and it was quite straightforward .

positive	wtihin 0 / 0 hour this was updated to 0 . 00 to 0 . 00 .
negative	two_weeks_later nothing came !
negative	one problem i had recently is i booked a hotel in europe .
neutral	my first experience went very good and it was very satisfying . this time i was told my order was being prepared for delivery , but she never received and i never got any explanation . i emailed customer service and was told they would look into it . her_birthday passed and no word . a few_days_later they emailed me i would receive a refund . so disappointing i wanted her to enjoy rather_than a refund . not happy

negative	i reordered the card and again never got notification either way .
neutral	i '_m a little frustrated not to have received my book after over 0_weeks
neutral	had we known this we might have chosen another kind of payment .
positive	they did everything you would ask for from an appliance company from stocking the item you are looking for at a reasonable price , keeping you informed the whole way through from taking the order to an_hour before the delivery and delivering free so no extra costs to be hit with after_placing the order .
neutral	so , other than the few_days that it took to correct my shipment address , everything was fine !
neutral	i essentially had to do the install twice .
positive	the prices on the parts were almost 00_% less_than the next closests competitor online parts supplier prices i could find and the shipping_costs were less_than half of the closest_competitor .
