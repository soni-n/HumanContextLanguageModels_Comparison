negative	it took more like two_weeks .
negative	i called and called but i only received the run_around .
negative	royal caribbean acknowledged the price drop and told me i couldn_'_t get the difference i paid because i paid in full but they offered me an upgrade to another category higher on the ship .
negative	the travelocity representative advised me not to take the upgrade and wait_until i heard from the guarantee department .
negative	needless to say the exact day that they let_me know that i didn_'_t qualify for the price guarantee the sale went off and royal caribbean could no_longer offer me the upgrade either .
negative	i didn_'_t get the price protection guarantee because they said the category was not the same .
negative	it was an upgraded category that was better_than mine for 000 less .
negative	travelocity did not care and did nothing to compensate me .
negative	i was furious and will never book with them again !!
negative	we cruise twice a year and they have certainly loss my business !
negative	do yourself a favor and book directly with the cruiseline , it will be worth your while .
negative	this was a horrible experience .
negative	i really tossed out the idea of canceling my booking all together and rebooking even_though it meant i would lose half my money .
negative	travelocity was awful and non accomdating .
negative	they put a huge negative on my very special_occasion .
negative	because of an airline delay , i missed my scheduled pick - up time .
negative	i contacted rentalcars . com as soon as my flight was rescheduled and 0 hours before the originally scheduled pick - up time to reschedule my pick - up .
negative	rentalcars delayed responding for 00_hours and then informed me that because it was after my scheduled pickup time i would forfeit 000_% of my paid in full rental .
negative	i '_ve spent the last several hours being given the run_around by this company both over the phone and online .
negative	they have the worst customer_service i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	they even sent my two fake phone numbers to call , one of which put me in an infinite loop with an advertisement for cruises to the bahamas .
negative	this is the worse online business i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	i ' d give zero_stars if it were possible .

negative	when we arrived in azusa to get our storage_unit they said the storage_unit was not available .
negative	admittedly it was move out weekend at the local college , but we were very disappointed .
negative	the confirmation number you supplied was ignored and we had to rent elsewhere .
negative	we are sorry your service didn_'_t work and will not seek storage at that place of business again - no_matter what the promises .

negative	i love their clothes but them getting them items shipped out takes_forever .
negative	by the time i get my clothes i won_'_t be excited anymore .
negative	we have been planning and saving for this trip for a year .
negative	our trip is for october_0000 .
negative	we aren_'_t even there yet and have had nothing but frustration and heartache .
negative	we are going to jamaica to get married and have our_honeymoon , to be one of the most joyous times in our lives and it has_been a nightmare for 0 days now !
negative	we have been on the phone with book it for 0 days and for and hour and a half each time .
negative	they are saying there is nothing they can do to help us fix our trip the way we wanted it in the first place .
negative	and to fix it , it is going to cost us an extra $_000 !
negative	we are already spending $ 0000 on this trip , something that we budgeted for .
negative	still on the phone with book it right now and have been for the past 0 hours !
negative	come to find out we have to use our flight vouchers through book it to now get the correct flight .
negative	so now we are stuck with book it for our flight .
negative	we are cancelling the hotel reservations with them and going to go through the hotel we want directly !
negative	this has_been the most horrific experience ever !!!!
negative	i will never go through book it ever again !!!
negative	!
negative	i would like to say that michael snarski , out of the three people we have had to talk to to try to resolve this has_been very nice and very helpful to go step by step through every figure and problem we had and try to help us as best he could .
negative	again , i will never use book it ever again !!!!!
negative	the worst_experience !!
negative	!
negative	i was told what to do .
negative	take out the cartridges , unplug printer , blah_blah_blah .
negative	but after the first time my printer won_'_t reset itself .
negative	cant print out business forms with no ink !
negative	shoulda " splurged " and went to staples .
negative	or better yet , will someone please tell me what happened to the kits where you could fill the cartridges yourself ??!!!
negative	i got good at that then they vanished !
negative	i went_ahead and purchased a hotel & flight package with bookit 0_weeks before my flight because there was supposedly only 0 seats left and they were having a sale .
negative	0 days_later i received an_email about another " sale " they were having and checked the price just to see what it was and it was $_000 cheaper !
negative	i tried to see if i could get the difference in fare and they said they couldn_'_t do anything to help me .
negative	that is ridiculous .
negative	if they wanted to show good customer_service , they could at_least have given me a partial_refund in the difference .
negative	not only that , but they " bookit perks " that were included in the trip were for free_wifi & breakfast , but wifi was only in the lobby of the hotel , not in the room !
negative	be warned !
negative	not good customer_service !!
negative	!
negative	trust me stay far away from this place they did 0 wheel bearings a little less then a year_ago 000 a piece and now they i need them done again either the job was not done right or the part was bad and cheap i found out the part came from a wholesale warehouse that are not using quality parts in your vechile they are cheap and are full of scams i will be calling the cooperate headquarters in the morningand most_likely will get the run_around i went to the shop were i got it done and was told by the new manager i would have never used that part company come on it '_s still mavis the company who ordered the part i just wish some one would have warned me about them so i hope this post helps people in the future

negative	we loved viator in barcelona .
negative	so we didn_'_t hesitate to book a very expensive trip in paris .
negative	it was pretty disappointing .
negative	we booked it for a tuesday , the 00 of may at 0 a . m . we stood in the rain waiting for one hour .
negative	they never came for us .
negative	we agreed to try again two_days_later .
negative	the van showed_up on time !
negative	this was supposed to be
negative	an eight person tour to normandy .
negative	fortunately , there were only six , because eight would not have fit comfortably for a fourteen hour tour .
negative	for six it would have been very comfortable , but the driver was in a hurry .
negative	his_wife needed him to help with his kids .
negative	he drove too fast , tailgated and passed on very narrow roads .
negative	we have seen a lot of bad drivers ( taipei , new_york , rome etc_.)
negative	but this was in a class by itself .
negative	his knowledge of his subject was superficial , and most_importantly , especially_since we were going to the beaches and cemetery at normandy , he had numerous unamerican comments to make .
negative	inappropriate anytime , but on this sad occasion , really hurtful .
negative	the battle sites are beautiful , the museum was very well_done , and the french countryside is breathtaking .
negative	i would not recommend reservationcounter to you .
negative	the website book my hotel resevation twice and continued to request info again after the second time i called the toll_free number and book the reservation and finally received a confirmation .
negative	the hotel informed me of 0 rooms booked
negative	placed an order dec 00 , site said product in stock website also said usually ships in 0 - 0 days , today dec 00 it says " in process " this is not acceptable .
negative	never sent me a notice there would be a delay , i had it shipped to a friend since i would be traveling .
negative	when i made this reservation , i made it straight from the hotel website ...
negative	when i called the hotel i was quoted $_000 a night .
negative	this is not what i was charged through your service .. i called your help number and received a telephone operator that could_barely speak_english and said she would try and cancel the last 0 nights for a refund .
negative	i am staying in this room until monday july_0th .
negative	i just want for you to match the price of $_000 a night to fix this problem i need a response quickly
negative	i paid a lot of money to have my labels delivered to the uk with the ups expedited service for my wedding .
negative	the my own_labels website says that the ups brokerage charge is included in the shipping cost .
negative	ups charged me a surcharge anyway .
negative	this plus vat doubled my shipping cost .
negative	i asked for a refund of the surcharge since i wasn_'_t warned about it and would not have placed my order if i ' d known shipping would cost so much ( around half the cost of the labels !).
negative	my own_labels refused to give me a refund , stating that this was an_additional surcharge and not their responsibility .
negative	not good customer_service !
negative	would not use this service which claims to represent the property that you want is really call_center for several others dishonest and then charge fees that they did not disclose and hotel then claims no responsibility
negative	i received a branded gift_card for $_00 .
negative	when attempting to " activate " it , the balance shown was $ 0 .
negative	we have contacted giftcards . com numerous_times over a period of 0 days .
negative	all we get is apologies and promises to fix it within 00_hours .
negative	so_far we hold a worthless card that we paid $_00 for .
negative	thanks a lot giftcards . com !

negative	i '_m going to do more shopping around before placing a order .
negative	if i could give zero_stars i would .
negative	i placed my order on the 00rd of march and just got an_email today , may_0th , saying that it was shipped .
negative	my items were in stock and supposed to ship within 0 - 0 business days .
negative	i sent several emails inquiring_about the order and they never responded .
negative	i actually assumed that the order wasn_'_t going to come .
negative	never again !
negative	purchased the alex heart sweater in cream as i wanted something for winter .
negative	it was also not cream but more of an outmeal colour , however that i could of lived with .
negative	having searched for long_sleeve sweaters and with the item description stating long_sleeved also i was somewhat suprised when it arrived and the sleeves were above my elbow .
negative	i returned the item an emailed boohoo , after_reading their returns_policy , to query why they not only do not offer to refund postage for items that are not are clearly not as_described but in addition to that add an_additional £ 0 . 00 restocking charge .
negative	0_weeks_later and i have received no response to my email , my review was removed from their site and i am still_awaiting a refund despite them acknowledging receipt of the item on 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	and to top it all the do not even have a customer_service number you can call to complain .
negative	would never use again
negative	i bought an ipod for my kid on christmas , the product never arrived to my hose .
negative	i asked the seller twice to ship it ups or fedex and to ask for a signature .
negative	after starting a claim , the seller showed a tracking_number confirming that he did ship the ipod , but through usps standard mail .
negative	what happened was that he tried to save some money ( although i paid for ups / fedex ) and never mentioned that a signature was required .
negative	the package must have been left_outside my house when no one was there and someone stole it .
negative	what did ebay say ?
negative	that the seller what not responsible , so i lost $_000 .
negative	will never buy on scambay again .
negative	go amazon !
negative	!
negative	you misrepresented your site as marriots site
negative	im so annoyed @ this site , i bought a total of 0 items and recieved 0 !!??
negative	my heels that cost me over $_00 aud weren_'_t in the parcel , i tried emailing them several_times and they just saying " we '_ll look into it " but the investigation didnt go_anywhere and its been sooo long .. i wanted to open a despute with paypal at one stage but i had no time , id rather warn_others on this fraud .
negative	please be careful with online shopping , i was so light headed about it , i now review before i purchase anything from any site ... be a smart shopper and dont get fooled like i did .. amiclubwear should be shutdown .
negative	and if theres others out there that went through what i did , dont stay silent .. let it out there .. they are making $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ a day & people just dont do anything about it , post as much blogs as possible , peace :)
negative	we were looking_forward to sitting in our lovely new teak garden chairs this summer when we bought them from achica ( and paid for them in full ) back in april .
negative	delivery was promised in may .
negative	well , it '_s now the middle of june and , yes , you '_ve guessed it we have no chairs .
negative	we must have heard every excuse in the book - mainly blaming their delivery company each time .
negative	" oh it '_ll be with you soon , it '_s in their warehouse ".
negative	all absolute rubbish .
negative	think it '_s a scam to hold_onto your money ( which they can then earn interest on ).
negative	they also have no interest in customer complaints and treat customers whose money they '_ve had for weeks with contempt .
negative	take my advice - do not buy from this company !
negative	!
negative	bought a single t shirt for a christmas_present and when it was delivered to the uk i was charged £_00 in customs charges .
negative	the t shirt itself was less_than that so i '_m absolutely gutted .
negative	never again .
negative	wonder_if it '_s legal to not make it clear that it would happen ?
negative	sure it '_s mentioned somewhere in the small_print but i didn_'_t see it .
negative	certainly not good for customers trying to get a bargain .
negative	the order was shipped usps and i never received it .
negative	i booked delivery for between 0 and 0 on a monday to deliver to my work and they arrived at 0 00 when i wasn_'_t there but didn_'_t wait and left a card so i rearranged it for the following_day when they didn_'_t arrive at all !!
negative	i probably_wouldn_'_t order from your site again because of this not because of your clothes which i love !
negative	!
negative	i placed an order for two dresses that i had found on the website on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the order said that i would receive the merchandise in approximately four days .
negative	i received a tracking_number , however this number was invalid when trying to track it from the upsn fed_ex , and usps websites .
negative	today , after no merchandise showed_up , i decided to call the customer_service number .
negative	after being put on hold for 00_minutes , a rude representative got on the phone and stated that my dresses had just been shipped from california this morning !!!!!
negative	horrified , i explained to her that the dresses were to be worn to a new year '_s eve party and that i needed them .
negative	she proceeded to tell me that they should arrive on monday ( 0 / 0 / 00 ).
negative	i told her if they weren_'_t here by the 00st that i would be sending them back and requesting a refund .
negative	she then tells_me they don_'_t do refunds and tells_me they only do store credits !!!
negative	i explained to her that i didn_'_t see that when i placed my order and she stated that the store policy was in a separate section of the website .
negative	i am now going to be stuck with 0 dresses and no where to wear them to !
negative	i was told by a friend of mine that she received her merchandise within 0 days so they apparently do what they want to do .
negative	will not be ordering from them anymore .
negative	i will stick with great glam !!
negative	!
negative	if you have problems , there is no way to get anyone on the telephone .
negative	you are on hold for awhile and then disconnected over and over .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	my part was lost in ups for days and emailed them to set_up an investigation and was just told it was out for delivery over email .
negative	emailed back and each email takes 00 to 00_hours to get an answer back
negative	no way to treat customers .
negative	no customer_service anymore .
negative	jeg_bestilte nogle ipad - opladere , der angiveligt var på lager og kunne afsendes inden et_par dage .
negative	de ankom imidlertid ikke , og efter en_uge så_jeg at de havde trukket mine_penge kort efter min bestilling , hvilket man vist ikke må ?
negative	jeg_skrev til_dem , for man_kan jo ikke ringe til_dem ( meget mærkeligt firma ), og de sagde at mine_varer ville komme på lager igen om et_par dage , og at de havde kommet til at trække pengene ( nej vel ??)
negative	.
negative	nu , to uger efter , har_jeg stadig ikke set skyggen af mine_varer , og_jeg_har bedt om at få annulleret handelen .
negative	jeg må anbefale folk at gå uden om dette firma , indtil de evt .

negative	0 stjerne fordi_jeg_ikke kunne_få_en prøvemåned , men måtte binde mig et halvt år ( hvis ikke jeg_ville betale latterlige 000_kr om måneden ) ( netflix giver en gratis prøvemåned )
negative	0 stjerne fordi_jeg_kun kan bruge en enhed ad gangen , og_vi altså er fire i min familie ... følg med tiden hbo !
negative	( netflix giver lov til at streame 0 enheder )
negative	0 stjerne pga af den meget dårlige brugerflade i appen , den er_meget uoverskuelig , søgemulighederne er utroligt begrænsede , man_kan_ikke spole i filmene med billeder , alt halter bagefter ...
negative	nu nænner jeg næsten ikke at tage flere stjerner fra jer .
negative	nååå jo , i skriver og reklamerer med at i har alle afsnit af alle sæsoner , og når_man så_har_købt ( og bundet sig uden fortrydelsesret ), finder man ud_af , at det altså kun gælder jeres egne produktioner .

negative	every time a report is refreshed it makes me call customer_service to verify my identity .
negative	this not only happens to me but my husbands account as well .
negative	after 0 months with the service they locked me out of all of our reports , even old ones , and told us they needed us to fax a marriage license , drivers_license , social_security card , and a bill with the current address to verify our identity .
negative	um .... why do they need that now if they didn_'_t need it in the beginning .
negative	okay , i '_m over it so i faxed in the " required " documents .
negative	the lady said call back first thing in the morning and you will be good to go .
negative	so i did .
negative	i called back saturday_morning and guess what ?
negative	the office that receives faxes is closed on the weekends .... ahhhhhh .
negative	who does faxes anymore .
negative	have these people from the 0000 '_s ever heard of email , scanning , uploading or any of those words that we have been using since at_least 0000 .
negative	c ' mon identity_guard get your crap together , get in the 00st_century and quit being a pain in my ass having to call you every_month at a minimum .
negative	if i '_m having to call you all the time i might as well call the credit_bureaus myself .... it would probably be more accurate .
negative	do not order from here .
negative	maybe they were rude because i was ordering from usa .
negative	they made a mistake on my engraving and blamed me .
negative	they took no responsibility and ruined my mother '_s day gift .
negative	go_anywhere but here .
negative	i ordered two dresses from this site and it took a week and a half to arrive although shipping for those two small dresses was $_00 . 00 .
negative	there was no information for me to track my package and when they came they looked horrible .
negative	i ordered a dress that was pictured as red and came in a burgundy color and it had threads coming apart everywhere !
negative	you can '_t get your money back and i have no desire to purchase anything_else and pay more outrageous shipping prices so i will just consider this a lesson_learned .
negative	i '_m so disappointed .
negative	i bought a black 000 ink_cartridge for my hp_printer to try out infarm .
negative	as soon as i took the plastic top off the cartridge , ink started dripping down my hand and onto my clothes .
negative	not fun .
negative	i had to throw it away .
negative	i purchased a groupon to this site to try it out .
negative	overall i am disappointed with my experience and would not purchase from this site ever again .
negative	i received my order from petflow . com and opened the package to find that it was not complete .
negative	the problem was that i ordered a 0 - pack of toys and only received a single toy .
negative	i called customer_service to report the issue and asked for the remaining two toys to be mailed to my house .
negative	the women told me that she would contact the warehouse to see where the problem was and call me back .
negative	two_days_later i called customer_service again because i had not heard_anything from the woman , and i realized that she had never even asked for my phone_number at all .. how could she have intended to call me back .
negative	i spoke with whom i believed to be the same women and she told me that she had wrote the warehouse an e_- mail and was still_waiting to here back and that i would not be sent the two toys until she heard from the warehouse .
negative	it really seemed that i was her last priority and that she just wanted me to get off the phone and stop calling .
negative	it has now been over a week and i have still not heard_anything , and do not believe that i ever will .
negative	overall i am very disappointing with this website and there customer_service .
negative	i have already wasted too much time on this issue which could have very easily be fixed with one phone_call .
negative	don_'_t waste your time ordering from this website , because that is all it appears to be .. a waste of my time .
negative	i have already urged my family and friends never to order from this website and contact groupon to let them know of the horrible service i received in hopes that others would not be tricked in the future as i have .
negative	we booked an all_inclusive and then hotel dates changed from the flight dates so we are left with one day no hotel room and its our_honeymoon ....
negative	book it did nothing to help us except we are so sorry .....
negative	wont use it again ... cheap is not always best !
negative	i am very dissatisfied with the serving obtained from avas_flowers !!
negative	i will never order anything again from your company !
negative	my order number 000000 was scheduled to be delivered on 0 / 0 / 00 , today is 0 / 00 / 00 and it has yet to be delivered .
negative	i called on sunday to find out why the delivery had not been made .
negative	they stated the florist was closed and that i would have to call back on monday .
negative	i called back monday_evening and the associate informed me that the recipient had not been home on friday when they attempted to deliver and so they rescheduled the delivery .
negative	i asked her why it had not been attempted all day monday because i knew for a fact that the recipient was home all day monday .
negative	the associate told me that she was unable to reach the local office therefore she couldn_'_t tell me why but she promised that she would upgrade my arrangement to a premium arrangement and make_sure it was delivered first thing tuesday_morning .
negative	here it is tuesday at almost 0 : 00_pm and guess what ..., it has not been delivered !
negative	again i call and am told i am sorry miss bean we will make_sure it is delivered by 0 : 00 tonight .
negative	the associate stated " it was rejected by our local_florist " something a our supply and demand ...
negative	i honestly as a customer do not care why it was rejected ... if it is an item that is on your website as " same day delivery " it or something equivalent to it better be delivered the same day !
negative	i have paid $_00 . 00 for something that was supposed to be delivered 0 days ago !!!
negative	i am completely dissatisfied and really have no confidence that this will be delivered today .
negative	not even one time did i receive a call about this order .... horrible customer_service !
negative	hello .
negative	so normally only good things would come out of my mouth when referring to amiclubwear but after this last transaction and my experience with trying to fix it i think that will be my very last transaction .
negative	whats not to love about them ... great deals , best shoes ever and get advise etc .
negative	but i feel almost like a friend betrayed me .
negative	i ordered 0 heels with this last transaction and was super excited to receive them especially_since i am about to have my second baby and it was a gift to myself and motivation to get back into shape etc ... after never receiving an_email about when they were on there way and / or what the hold u was i tried emailing and calling numerous_times with no response .
negative	finally i received one of the shoes and they are the wrong_size !
negative	so i finally called and finally got thru to an actual_person .
negative	she said didnt even offer to replace the wrong_size only emailed me a return_label so i can ship them back ( lets see how long it takes to receive an refund )!!
negative	oh and she told me i should of received a refund for the other shoes and of course i havent .
negative	im so upset .
negative	i have never wanted a pair of shoes so bad for some_reason but i did .
negative	today i went and bought some really awesome heels somewhere_else .
negative	i am sooooooo disappointed with amiclubwear .
negative	i always spoke the best tings about them .
negative	ughh so unhappy !
negative	i placed two_separate_orders for fussie cat .
negative	both orders were wrong .
negative	bernard in customer_service was rude , dismissive , argumentative and blamed me for he wrong order before finally blaming the fussie cat company .
negative	he did not try to reconcile things with me .
negative	he said he would get to the bottom of it and contact me .
negative	that resulted in a few emails where he blew me off , took no responsibility for petflow messing up both orders and suggested i contact fussie cat to complain --- even_though it was petflow who messed_up both orders .
negative	he wouldn_'_t call me back .
negative	fussie cat is a great food which my cat loves .
negative	thank_goodness i found a new company to order from bc i will never do_business with petflow as long as bernard is allowed to ruin petflow '_s reputation and interact with loyal_customers .
negative	he has a terrible attitude .
negative	surely there are others who need a job who would actually be helpful !... if any of you have any trouble , ask for steve as he is awesome !
negative	i told the person taking the reservation that we have 0_adults and 0 children which he repeated back to me correctly .
negative	that is not what he entered .
negative	he entered 0_adults and 0 children into the system which is also what printed out on my reservation .
negative	i do not appreciate the appearance that i lied .
negative	i will never use this company again !
negative	it has_been a terrible customer_service !!
negative	i was supposed to receive updates on my shipment .
negative	it has_been a month and no shipment ,. terrible i will never buy again !
negative	not satisfied - i replaced the black_ink_cartridge and it wouldn_'_t work after 0 days .
negative	what are my options .
negative	please respond .
negative	i spent 0 hours on the phone with multiple rude people that i could not understand .
negative	when asked to repeat what they said because i couldn_'_t understand them , they acted as if i was the idiot .
negative	all i wanted to do was cancel a previous trip and replace it with a different location .
negative	i will never use travelocity again after being a member for over 0_yrs .
negative	i was booking the reservation and i clicked the submit_button .
negative	the next page said error , and try again .
negative	i assumed this meant that the hotel reservation didn_'_t go through .
negative	i then_proceeded to make an reservation at a different hotel , on a different site .
negative	i booked the hotel , then i received a confirmation_email_saying that the first hotel went through and was booked .
negative	lucky me .
negative	i now have 0 hotels booked the same night , and i can '_t get a refund .
negative	i '_m already having financial troubles in life , but then the big wigs won_'_t refund my money due to a mistake on their own website .
negative	do i ended_up paying for a hotel , which stayed vacant all night .
negative	all the jewelry ($_000 ) worth looked terrific online .......... but when i opened the packages , they all looked very , very cheap ...... i was going to give these for xmas_gifts ........ very , very disappointed ..... sandra s
negative	they got my appliance wrong , then brought the right one out took the wrong_size back told me they ' d refund me the difference_between machines and as a good will gester they would do it me at the price of 0kg this they did not do
negative	i will never buy again
negative	my daughter and i were trying to book a flight to vegas in july to a conference .. we spent the much needed time to properly choose the best flight times and dates for our trip .
negative	we made our choice and did not realize til after that the wrong choice was selected .
negative	i tried_calling your office only to receive a message to call back in the morning .
negative	in the meantime , we thought it best to again try to book the right flights as we already have our conference tickets and hotel booked .
negative	we were worried that we would be left without a flight to a business conference we had booked .
negative	this morning i called to get the first flight reversed and taken off our mastercard .
negative	we were told that we could not as 00_hrs had passed ..
negative	i informed the attendant that in fact it was just past 00_hrs !
negative	after being passed on to a manager ,..
negative	i was told that united_airlines could only offer us a credit with a $_000 penalty per passenger !!!!!
negative	can you imagine that !!?
negative	i told the attendant that we could not afford a credit or a penalty !!
negative	i am pleading with your company to please honor our wishes and reverse the charges .
negative	thank_you .. respecfully ,, myra booking ref # 000 - 000 - 000 is the incorrect booking ..... 000 - 000 - 000 is the correct one .
negative	if you check out the times that each were booked you can surely see that we did not change our mind on our flight dates ,.. it strictly was a computer error and we need to have the charges reversed .
negative	the website states that you will have your items in 0 - 0 days .
negative	this is not true .
negative	you will receive your items a week_later at best .
negative	when calling customer_service , i wanted to cancel my order if i was not going to received it by 0 days and they promised i would .
negative	a week_later ... my order came , very disappointing .
negative	customer_service needs to be made aware of processing and shipping times .
negative	we booked a dolphin swim at the atlantis in the bahamas and expedia never contacted the company to schedule the swim or verify that we had paid .
negative	i had to call them from a foreign_country only to be put on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	when someone finally answered , thy hung_up on me after 00 seconds .
negative	i called the next_day and was told that they had done nothing wrong because going between the companies was " my responsibility ."
negative	they would not even offer me a coupon for my trouble .
negative	horrible service .
negative	do not book excursions through them !!
negative	!
negative	i was so surprised to get this request to review the product considering i have not yet received it .
negative	hard to tell you about it when i don_'_t have it .
negative	sure hope it arrives soon .
negative	obviously the company thinks i have it .
negative	firstly the item was clearly defective , this was visible through the plastic sealed wrapping and therefore should have been seen by the person packaging .
negative	my son contacted superdry to arrange return , replacement and asked for some form of compensation from the store ( a lunchtime visit to a central_london post_office isn_'_t a pleasant nor quick trip ).
negative	they offered to discount 00_% from my card but my son pointed_out that as the gift was being returned by him , they should be offering him something , not me .
negative	it took about 00 emails and an escalation to the customer_services manager before they finally offered him 0 . 0 %_off a future order .
negative	i honestly think that '_s very poor from such a recognisable brand ( other establish brands routinely offer 00 - 00_% depending_on the nature of the mistake / error ).
negative	my son returned the damaged goods and included two notes that advised of the delivery address for the replacement , also commenting that it was a present .
negative	then i received an_email_saying the item was out of stock and my card would be refunded .
negative	nobody attempted to contact my son ( who returned the item ) to advise him of this .
negative	my son then had to contact customer_services again to and only at this last stage was the matter resolved with the customer_services manager sourcing a replacement for him .
negative	this whole mess could , and should have been dealt_with within one or two emails .
negative	there were also plenty of opportunities for various members of the company '_s customer_services / support staff to identify that this situation was not a bog - standard situation .
negative	if only one member of staff had taken pride in their job , their brand and their responsibilities and gone that tiny_bit more to ensure this was dealt_with properly then our entire experience would have been good .
negative	it shouldn_'_t take 00 emails to be offered 0 . 0 % because of the company '_s mistake .
negative	the staff receiving back the damaged goods should have made efforts to contact my son advising of the stock issue and offering a solution as to how they were going to try and fix the situation .
negative	this company needs to fully examine both their staff training and process management .
negative	my booking experience was great , your rep was wondering .
negative	she actually called the hotel and confirmed my handicap room .
negative	when i got to the sheraton they did not have our reservation , i gave them the confirmation print out and they couldn_'_t find our reservation .
negative	worse service on the hotel '_s side ever !!
negative	!
negative	not happy , sold 0 phones at the same time , 0 of them were worth nothing and the other 0 was worth quite abit !
negative	only received one cheque from them , and that was the cheapest one !
negative	had an ema saying they were all in the post , but still_waiting on the other 0 !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a froliccat toy and it was supposed to have 0 toys with feathers that were replaceable but when this toy arrived it had 0 red fluff ball with 0 feathers attached that were not what was ordered .
negative	my cat had this destroyed within 0 hour and now i have nothing to reorder since it did not come the way it was supposed to .
negative	i am still_waiting for replies to my emails and phone_calls regarding the wrong items that arrived
negative	i have not received the replacement months later
negative	please phone me to sort this out .
negative	how else can i contact you you do not answer the phone or emails .
negative	please help me
negative	don_'_t be_fooled by priceline saying there is no change or cancellation fees on hotels .
negative	they will not honor a change to the next night .
negative	this is absolutely false_advertising .
negative	i will not be using priceline again .
negative	only card transaction in a while was this one , and my card was frauded by 0 mobile_phone top ups - helped themselves to £_00 - emailed customer_service - of no help totally untrustworthy
negative	i have been a loyal_customer of macy '_s until a recent disaster with a furniture purchase .
negative	we ordered a three piece sectional on november 0rd and chose a stock color so we would have it by thanksgiving .
negative	we were not notified until after we purchased the sofa that it was on back order until january .
negative	we had to cancel our thanksgiving dinner and christmas party since we had no couch .
negative	when the pieces were finally delivered in january , 0 out of the 0 were damaged .
negative	macy '_s offered us an even exchange but explained it wouldn_'_t be in until march .
negative	they left the damaged sofa at our home .
negative	the replacement pieces arrived but they were even more damaged than the first set .
negative	they took the original damaged pieces back and left the new damaged pieces with us .
negative	one is still wrapped in packaging sitting in our garage .
negative	i have spent numerous hours on the phone with customer_service and visited the store but they have offered us nothing !
negative	we were told to wait_until april when they could do another exchange .
negative	i demanded a full_refund and asked them to come pick_up the items but the earliest they can come is two_weeks .
negative	i have to wait an_additional week after that before my refund will be processed .
negative	in the meantime i have been over 0 months with no sofa and i can '_t even get a replacement until they take the broken one and give me my money back .
negative	macy '_s has shown they do not care about their customers and have no issue selling damaged pieces .
negative	i '_m extremely disappointed and intend on closing my macys card once my refund is processed .
negative	i will not do_business with a company that does not stand_behind their customers .
negative	ted baker gift_cards can not be used online despite the claims that this service is temporarily unavailable and they will fix it soon .
negative	actually they have been saying this for years !
negative	i do not understand_why they would continue to lie to their customers and business partners .
negative	it is just insulting .
negative	especially_considering their very high prices .
negative	these gift_cards also can not be used in john_lewis , selfridges , house of fraser etc .
negative	but they continue advertising their product as something you can easily redeem .
negative	when i contacted customer_service about it repeatedly they just ignored me .
negative	other customers have had the same experience , just googleing this issue will give loads of information how they are just palming people off and continue to lie about it .
negative	i have been a fan of tb and i buy it a lot and i have had almost no_complaints about the quality or service but this is just an embarrassment to the company .
negative	what they are trying to achieve with it i do not understand .
negative	is stealing customers money and lying to them the way to do_business ?
negative	just look at your rating here .
negative	this should be a wake_up call for you .
negative	there is plenty of competition out there and if you continue like this you will not last for long !
negative	i received parts 0_weeks_ago , i am waiting to hear from you so that i can return one of the parts .
negative	( rma )
negative	it seems like you are not ready for main stream .
negative	is it that you do not wish to hire more staff because you may have to pay their medical ?
negative	whatever the case , this is outrageous .
negative	i have had many years of great service from carmen nieves during the hectic tax season .
negative	this past_year our taxes were a bit different with adding another business and being an llc .
negative	our taxes were delayed in filing to ensure all information was filed accurately , mostly on my part for waiting until the last two_weeks to file .
negative	i have the upmost confidence in carmen nieves , it '_s a pleasure working with her during this nerve_racking time !
negative	hoping she will_continue with the business , should she leave , i will follow .
negative	many_thanks ,
negative	martha
negative	don_'_t stay at the golden nugget in biloxi .
negative	this used to be the isle of capri casino and resort and we went there frequently .
negative	this time it was a mistake .
negative	the room was substandard and the bathroom was dirty .
negative	the sheets had stains on them and the comforter had burn holes in it .
negative	huge stain on the carpet , horrible dollar store pillows .
negative	the air_conditioning froze you at the lowest temp .
negative	the buffet had about the worst food i '_ve ever had the displeasure to eat , the food was bland and the crablegs were so overcooked the meat was dried up .
negative	no cudos for the hotel staff either , the people during the day shift showed little interest in their guests .
negative	children are permitted to run rampant in the hotel and the pool , not a relaxing wasy to spen time at a casino .
negative	the evening staff was very helpful and moved us to another room .
negative	they are showing the renovated rooms on the 0th_floor and they are very nice , but i won_'_t be going back until the renovation is complete .
negative	i ordered a pair of earrings for my sister for christmas and they came with one of the earrings broken in half .
negative	waste of my money .
negative	i ordered online from yesstyle , and some of my items i did not like and wish to return .
negative	their return_policy states that you must contact their customer_service within 00 days to get a rma_number before sending back .
negative	i '_ve been trying to call and no one picks_up the phone !
negative	its just an answering_machine .
negative	i would just send it back , but other people online have complained_about sending back and never getting their money back so i want to make_sure i follow return process properly .
negative	this is not good , i will_continue to try to contact their customer_service the rest of this week to get a rma_number and time and ship back .
negative	after that i ill have to file a dispute with my credit_card company and paypal and force a return , i hope i do not have to do that .
negative	stop this company act now , they are evil
negative	i had a lot of problems :
negative	first of all , i ordered a concorde model but sometime along the purchaising it showed a saint - honoré model .... and that is what i received ...
negative	well , i tried to explain it through the web but taylor0less rejected my issue telling_me that it wasn ´ t true .
negative	when i tried to explain it again , i couldn ´ t do it because my order took place more than 00 days before .
negative	this was true , but it wasn ´ t my fault .
negative	it was because of the new year celebration in china .....!
negative	!
negative	i am not very happy about the service , very inflexible
negative	regards
negative	approximately 0_weeks_ago i ordered a radiator , platinum part number 0000 - 00000000 for my 00 toyota landcruiser .
negative	i still have not received my radiator although my account has_been charged the full_amount .
negative	ridiculous , awul !!!!
negative	i have been waiting for it about a month !!!!!!
negative	too slow !!!!
negative	got it with scratches !!!
negative	and now muth more !!!
negative	i have payment from dhl for shipping from china )))))))))
negative	this company promised to fix it and pay me back , but for today i still have this problem and i have the third person , who does not know of course and who can not figure_out what is going on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	it is so annoying ((((((((((((((((((((((((
negative	i had to click on a star but in reality my experience was rated as a zero star one .
negative	i made a reservation with silver_shuttle based on the positive_reviews i had read online .
negative	i needed to be at heathrow before the tube started running and i thought i had found the answer .
negative	until the day came for them to pick me up .
negative	i began waiting for the driver at 0 :_00am .
negative	at 0 : 00 i called since i was supposed to have been picked_up 00_minutes earlier to find out where the driver was .
negative	after being put on hold for 00 - 00_minutes i was told that the driver went to the wrong hotel and would be to me in 0 - 00_minutes .
negative	i went outside to wait and 00_minutes later the bellhop put me in a taxi since the driver did not show .
negative	the only offer that has_been made to me for compensation is a 00_%_off coupon for my next booking .
negative	needless to say i won_'_t be using it and i would recommend that you do not book with silver_shuttle either .
negative	all the reviews i read said they received their parts fast .
negative	it took 0 days for mine .
negative	then it '_s defective .
negative	i filled out the form on line the very night i received it requesting a rma .... their automated systems says i '_ll hear back in 00 - 00_hours , i still_haven_'_t heard from anyone even after i filled out yet another form asking for a status
negative	because let_me tell you are some of the worst scammers because you told me that i was going to return the money when he writes that it was too long and had spent more than 00 days and no service .
negative	i said sorry for the inconvenience and we will refund your money to your card , and never came so i went back to writing today .
negative	that lack of respect to people .
negative	this product was ordered last monday ( april
negative	00 ) after 0 days , i contacted ljshopping to find out where my order was as i had paid for two day shipping and had not received any shipping information etc_., yet my payment was made and accepted .
negative	i received an_email_stating that ljshopping company wasn ’ t sure about the address so the order wasn ’ t shipped , even_though i had enter the shipping address on the order when it was placed , and my
negative	confirmation clearly indicates the shipping address .
negative	they never attempted to contact me with this information .
negative	a representative from ljshipping
negative	company responded that the order would be shipped friday .
negative	0 - 0 day shipping
negative	should have had it to me by tuesday , april 00 , at the latest .
negative	i still have no
negative	product , had paid for express shipping and the product as of 0 days ago now .
negative	fed_ex tracking has an anticipated ship date listed only . nothing has_been updated in days .
negative	another attempt to find out where the order was received a response that it was shipped but the fedex record was failing to update and now they were out of the product .
negative	i asked why that should matter if my order had shipped and have not received a response .
negative	have now demanded a refund of payment to include payment for express shipping .
negative	called on march 00 th to schedule a con joining room for 0 people at the marriott in brighton .
negative	first the lady told me the room was 000 . 00 for a 0r bed 0 room but then she say it '_s 000 all together i told her no i do not want to pay that much to just cancel that she said umm hold on let_me talk to my supervisor about 00_minutes later she tell me her supervisor said i could have both rooms for the price of 000 with 0 beds so i said ok well turns_out she booked me for 0 room so i called right back to cancel i spoke to a man_who said it can take 0 to 00 business days for the one to go back on my card .
negative	how rude and a waste of my time !
negative	ordering books from bookbyte is one of the worst decisions i have ever made .
negative	the books were cheaper_than the sites i normally purchase my books from , which was nice .
negative	but , it took nearly 0_weeks for my books to get here .
negative	and i had made sure i picked books that were in " used - excellent " or " used - very good " condition , yet the books that arrived were in horrible condition .
negative	the books were basically just stacks of messed_up papers without even the covers of the books .
negative	i will never be ordering books from bookbyte again .
negative	if you ' re looking for somewhere to order books , avoid bookbyte at all costs , and order them from amazon or chegg instead , even if the books do cost a little more .
negative	ricevo abbastanza merce consegnata via corriere e posso dire che_ci sono sempre problemi quanto il corriere è bartolini : a volte è la sede di san pietro mosezzo ( novara ), ultimamente borgomanero ( almeno di borgomanero devo aggiungere che una signorina molto cortese mi_ha telefonato al primo giorno di mancata consegna - peccato che_mi_ha promesso la_consegna per l ' indomani , invece sono passati due giorni senza che_mi avvisassero del rinvio ), ma il risultato è sempre lo stesso : la_merce non arriva nel giorno previsto ; se guardo sul tracking risulta consegnata molto rapidamente nella sede di smistamento - e lì si perde !
negative	o mettono in consegna e dicono di non aver trovato nessuno ( quando non è assolutamente vero ), oppure che_non hanno trovato il numero civico ( se contano solamente sul navigatore , è vero che google pensa che l ' ultimo n . civico sia il 00 o il 00 , ma la strada continua tranquillamente , con case e numeri civici .... soltanto dal n . 00 in poi bisogna sapere se girare a sinistra sotto l ' arco della cascina al 00 oppure andare a destra nei campi ( sembrerebbe ovvio la scelta della sinistra , ma nel dubbio basterebbe chiedere ad una delle varie famiglie che abitano al 00 a , b , c , d ..... oppure telefonare a me - altrimenti a cosa serve lasciare il proprio recapito telefonico al fornitore / corriere ??)
negative	passano poi giorni prima della consegna effettiva .
negative	se ho la possibilità di specificarlo , dico : venite con_un mezzo piccolo ( no furgone col cassone alto ) per passare sotto l ' arco , oppure arrivate all ' arco e mi telefonate : la mia casa è a 000 metri , arrivo a piedi se il_pacco è piccolo o in macchina se è grande .
negative	gli autisti sono sempre diversi , quasi sempre stranieri , sempre arrabbiati e maleducati .
negative	quando chiedo loro perché non hanno telefonato al primo viaggio ( ammesso e non concesso che_ci sia stato un primo tentativo di consegna !)
negative	dicono che è perché chiamare col cellulare costa e la bartolini non rimborsa le telefonate ....... non costerebbe di meno a tutti pagare loro un cellulare con_un numero massimo di chiamate se hanno tanta paura di abusi ) piuttosto che fare , almeno in teoria , almeno 0 - 0 ' tentativi ' prima di consegnare effettivamente ?
negative	?
negative	come mai la dhl , l ' ups e tutti gli altri che_mi consegnano o mi trovano al primo colpo , o sanno trovarmi a colpo sicuro perché gli autisti sono sempre gli stessi e non ogni volta uno diverso , aggressivo , e che si mette a bestemmiare se deve fare manovra o se è in ritardo con le altre consegne da fare in giornata ( come se fosse colpa mia !
negative	).
negative	le cose sono così :
negative	0 . o la bartolini paga talmente male i suoi ' padroncini ' che sono perennemente incavolati ( per dirlo con_un eufemismo ), non danno loro istruzioni adeguate e non rimborsano loro le telefonate di lavoro ....... quindi un fornitore serio dovrebbe evitare di dar lavoro a degli sfruttatori di manodopera che guadagnano sulla loro pelle oppure
negative	0 . se mai gli autisti fossero dipendenti ( non credo proprio , almeno qui in zona tutti coloro cui ho chiesto mi_hanno risposto di essere padroncini ), dovrebbero insegnar loro delle regole di base tipo : consegnare nel giorno previsto ; telefonare al numero fornito ( a spese bartolini ) nel caso non trovasse nessuno o non trovasse il numero civico o la via , oppure se avesse altre difficoltà , in maniera da non inchiodare in casa gente ad aspettare un pacco che_non arriverà quel giorno ;
negative	insegnar loro a trattare il destinatario con rispetto e a tener alto il nome della ditta per cui lavorano ( siano dipendenti o subcontrattati ).
negative	più di una volta gli autisti mi_hanno aggredita verbalmente o si sono sfogati contro la bartolini ( che dovrebbero rappresentare ), anche producendosi in bestemmie da far impallidire i santi .....
negative	fornitori , boicottate la bartolini - ci sono tanti altri corrieri bravi e cortesi !
negative	years_ago i always shopped_around and ending up always buying flights on lastminute . com as they were cheapest and no_problems .
negative	also occasionally used secret deals in uk and got excellent bargains .
negative	no more !
negative	prices constantly higher_than others and for a holiday i am planning to norway i looked at their offerings in many different towns - always more_expensive than others .
negative	to avoid giving total monopoly to booking . com , i eventually booked an airport hotel ( early_morning flight out next_day ) with lastminute , as its price was identical to booking . com .
negative	as soon as i got confirmation i saw the trick - booking and the hotel '_s own website offered room at this ( cut ) price , including an excellent ( per reviews ) breakfast , whereas last_minute . com excluded breakfast .
negative	within one hour i made a complaint , was fobbed_off with an automatic response and eventually told 0 days_later too bad , i hadn_'_t immediately claimed to their price matching team ( as if i knew which dept to apply to , i wrote to customer_service ) attaching a screenshot of the two offers , within 00_hours of booking - i insisted , saying i was a long - term customer and attaching a screenshot of hotel website offer still better_than theirs ( booking - com offer was by then no_longer available at that price ); again refused .
negative	i asked for complaint to be elevated to supervisory level , was told this had been done and would get reply within 00 working hours .
negative	after 0 days still no reply , wrote again , only to get a reply basically telling_me to get lost .
negative	i have and am .
negative	last_minute will never again see my custom .
negative	i ordered contacts and was told that it would be a 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	the order was not even fulfilled until 0 business days_later because they were multi focal , and then it took another 0 full business days to even receive them .
negative	and i am saying that prematurely as i still have not received mine .
negative	i will tell_everyone that i know to order from another company and stay away from this site .
negative	i had an urgent delivery to make to my nephew who ' d forgotten some critical equipment for his cadet camp in england .
negative	so i investigated express deliveries and found a company that promised a pick_up 0am on the tuesday which they guaranteed would get to him for 0am on wednesday .
negative	it was just about worth the expense .
negative	they didn_'_t pick_up until late morning on the tuesday - never saying that would cause a problem and then i got a message on thursday_morning saying it had just been delivered .
negative	hardly worth it as he travels home on the friday .
negative	i '_m really disappointed
negative	wrong day wrong price
negative	had to start all over
negative	hi
negative	just so that you are aware , i have not received the goods i ordered last_week .
negative	please can someone look into it for me and get back .
negative	cheers
negative	karen
negative	i booked with you because the price was £_00 . 00 for 0 days parking at manchester .
negative	when i filled in my debit_card details , the price suddenly increased to nearly_£_00 . 00 !
negative	i didn_'_t tick any extras and my confirmation doesn_'_t show the price paid so unable to go back and check what i '_ve been charged for .
negative	i don_'_t think i '_ll be using your services again .
negative	send load of parcels via a 0rd_party ( parcel0go ).
negative	usually use hermes or yodel as they work out the cheapest .
negative	not always the best !!
negative	if you '_ve got any_problems you have to chat online to parcel0go as there are no contact phone numbers and hermes wont deal with you directly .
negative	they have lost parcels , said they have delivered parcels when they haven_'_t , and held parcels up with no communications to either me or parcel0go .
negative	they don_'_t answer their emails and they don_'_t communicate at all .
negative	the service is diabolical and they don_'_t care .
negative	they are very cheap but sometimes that isn_'_t always best !!!
negative	hermes you need to shake up your act .
negative	you just need to read the reviews on here to see how crap they are .
negative	you ' d think they would want to improve !!!!
negative	!
negative	purchased a filter .
negative	this was actually the 0nd company i had ordered from to try to buy this filter .
negative	first company had sold me the filter , and not bothered to tell me that it was out of stock for 0_weeks .
negative	so when i purchased this filter , i called the day after to make_sure i was getting it shipped to me immediately .
negative	the female sales_rep said that it was shipped , but it was coming from the warehouse in california so it may take up to 0 days .
negative	after a week , i called again .
negative	at this time i was told , after a long wait and a call back 0 hour later , that the filter had not shipped , but it was going to be shipped that day .
negative	i insisted that it be shipped over night since the original rep had bold faced lied to me .
negative	he said he had to check with the shipping company and could call me back 00 - 00_minutes later .
negative	did not happen .
negative	he called me the next_day , and told me that the company had already shipped the item , and could not get it shipped next_day .
negative	said it should arrive on tuesday .
negative	was shipped supposidly on thursday .
negative	not happy at all .
negative	he offered a $_00 refund , which frankly was the very least he could do given the circumstance .
negative	what would have been better would have been to ship another next_day shipping , and a return_slip for the the second one that is coming in a week .
negative	for a company that says the items will ship out in 0 - 0 days , and arrive in 0 , it has now been a week before the shipping and will be 0_weeks before i recieve the item .
negative	plus many phone_calls .
negative	horrible service , and reps that lie
negative	no one stayed at the entrance so people coming in that didn_'_t know the code had traffic backed_up .
negative	lighting in the room is horrible .
negative	also bought a one room with king_bed and didn_'_t recieve that .
negative	other than that ok .
negative	but won_'_t be staying again .
negative	* i selected only 0_star however , to be clear , no one was rude to me *
negative	i get it , all your reviews state how wonderful the customer_service is .
negative	how exciting it is to buy a car and the great experiences at drive time from their car sales_associates and how quickly you are able to get in your car of choice which was only a dream a few_minutes before because of the not so good credit we all have or we would not be here .
negative	the " quick " part of this is what they take_advantage of .
negative	i absolutely love laura who sold us our car and all the other associates at alta mere in ft . worth were very nice , helpful and extremely respectful of our situation as well .
negative	they advertise this warranty and looking at all the " big print " makes it sound completely fool_proof .
negative	the sales_associates even know the big important parts of this they can rattle it off as if they were paid_extra to memorize these warranty / coverage ads !
negative	all of these cars have so many miles on them because they were all rentals ?
negative	all of them ?
negative	are you sure ?
negative	i '_ve never had a rental with the sort of things we found in our car .
negative	when we bought our 0000 caliber on 0 / 00 / 0000 we had a 000_% positive_experience at drive time .
negative	now , 0 months later ... 0 whole weeks .... not so much .
negative	i '_ve had to take my car to their " in network " auto repair_shop yesterday , 0 / 00 / 00 , because there were 0 different places making some god awful noises .
negative	the shop calls this morning and explains to me the problems : the ac_compressor is breaking , chattering and between the compressor and the fan is why the loud noise .
negative	it also bogs the car down really bad .
negative	the ball bearings are worn down is what '_s making a grinding noise when i turn .
negative	the brakes are squeeking so bad i hear them over my ( loud ) music with windows shut driving on a stop and go 0 late hwy .
negative	he says they need replacing but are ok for now .
negative	also , there is a loose flap or something flapping around in the drivers_side front_wheel well .
negative	well that flap is the only repair approved by drive time '_s warranty claims department !!!
negative	0 major and 0 minor repairs were denied because these problems are " not a complete failure / broken " yes , i said that correctly ... until the problem is a complete failure or completely broken they do not approve repairs on the warranty that we are paying for !!
negative	no thought of how one problem , if not fixed , can easily lead to another problem .
negative	i am assuming this is their mo ... deny , deny , deny .. until we can '_t take it anymore and just pay for it ourselves !!
negative	so here we are at the end of may in texas and they won_'_t repair my ac_compressor and fan ?
negative	just that alone pisses me off !
negative	i hate the heat !
negative	therefore , i have come to a solution to this problem .
negative	i will advertise drive time all over this car ...
negative	when people hear me driving and look at me wondering " wth is that ?"
negative	they will see my mobile drive time advertisements all over this embarrassingly loud - as - hell car !!!
negative	i am going to buy the appropriate things needed for this sort of advertisement just as soon as i pick my car up from the dealer this afternoon .
negative	i will give drive time claims / warranty dept until 0pm today to change their minds or they will be wishing they did !
negative	i will soon be driving about 00_miles to work on two major_highways so they ' re likely to get a whole lot of advertisement !!
negative	i will be happy to post a pic of my drive time ad on facebook , twitter , pintrist and any other social_media site i can find .
negative	stay tuned !
negative	i will not be using again .
negative	having informed them and sending photo of glasses arriving missing a nose support - despite 0 days in their lab for quality check - how do you not spot a missing nose support ?- l was told they would send a replacement which of course l am then obliged to try and fit myself or pay an optician to do it for me - no offer to cover any cost .
negative	when l complained after 00days l had not received the replacement and depending_on the response would determine my feedback - the reply was it would arrive in next 0 days - no word of apology .
negative	not good enough .
negative	the replacement nose_piece has now arrived with screws so tiny they are barely visible to me and with no screwdriver with which to tighten them .
negative	hopeless !
negative	!
negative	made reservations with priceline who claimed to have the best prices on hotels !
negative	when i got to the hotel the room was $_00 . 00 less_than what priceline charged .
negative	they wouldn_'_t refund the difference but apologized .
negative	beware !
negative	do yourself a favor and do not buy from this awful place !!!
negative	worst customer_service ever !!!
negative	especially [_name ]!!
negative	!
negative	i have deliveries set_up for every 0_weeks or more ; another came in 0_weeks ; no where to store this , no_idea what to do with it .. how do i return it without it costing me a fortune ??
negative	?
negative	i came upon your company through a amazon promotion .
negative	i bought a £_00 voucher .
negative	i received the voucher and tried to use it on your website .
negative	i followed the instructions on how to claim the discount .
negative	but not only did you not subtract my discount but you charged me full price and took my credit_card number .
negative	when i tried to call your helpline the phone was unanswered and was cut_off ( dead ).
negative	i ended_up contacting amazon who had in fact had several customers complaint about the same problem .
negative	they too were charged full price and could not use the vouchers .
negative	i eventually through email got in contact with someone named rahal malik who wrote this :
negative	please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience you may have experienced .
negative	at iflorist , we take_pride in ensuring our customer ’_s satisfaction .
negative	unfortunately , we did not meet your expectations .
negative	i would request you to kindly contact amazon to get it resolved as voucher is been issued by them .
negative	as a testament to strive for perfection , we have taken steps to ensure that this will never happen again .
negative	we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best .
negative	if you have any further questions or comments regarding this matter , please feel free to discuss it with us .
negative	amazon say the problem lay on your side not there .
negative	they just issued the voucher it is your job to honor them .
negative	all in all it was a complete rip_off .
negative	in future i will order my flowers from interflora or mark and spencer
negative	opticsfast pictures do not display in rgb but instead are muted and are their listings describe the product wrong in the pic , wrong in description , and wrong by advice from representatives ... you will not do wrong and get by .....
negative	it is dishonest and poor customer care to know that the pics from vendors reflect wrong colors and descriptions thus causing people to order wrong frames and have to pay restocking fees of 00_%.
negative	00_% of $ is $_00 dollars plus shipping .
negative	they will take almost $_000_dollars if you buy and have to return your item .. i made much effort to resolve which was in vain ... opticsfast has a deaf ear and their level of customer care is really low .
negative	don_'_t do_business with them for you stand the risk of looking at pics that do not display true colors and descriptions that leave out colors and representatives that tell you the same thing as their pics and descriptions on the internet because they have not seen them either .
negative	thus this is a lose lose lose situation with the customer at a 00_% loss , shipping loss and time loss and abusive tactics phone_calls and emails .
negative	quality outstanding .
negative	we have also tried the salmon , which is great , but really to costly for my family .
negative	i know you can not put a price on health and quality , i would like to buy the seafood but like i said it is to costly for us .
negative	thanks
negative	made reservations by phone for flight , hotel , car .
negative	our last night was scheduled for july 00 in a different hotel from the one we were staying for other 0 nights .
negative	our rental_car was supposed to be july 00 - july 00 .
negative	our flight was july 00 return on july 00 .
negative	made these reservations on april 00 .
negative	on april 00 received e_- mail confirming my stay for april 00 .
negative	called immediately to inform them dates for one night hotel and rental_car were wrong .
negative	representative called hotel to cancel and of course , they refused .
negative	travelocity agent had made reservation for april instead of july .
negative	numerous phone_calls have yielded nothing but lies .
negative	said they would call me back in 00_hours after they reviewed initial phone_call recording to see who was at fault .
negative	never happened .
negative	called back .
negative	same story .
negative	after numerous_calls to them they finally said they didn_'_t have a recording and it was my fault the reservatios were made for the wrong date because i agreed .
negative	would advise anyone to steer_clear of this company .
negative	just thankful our plane_tickets and other hotel were on the right date or i would have lost over $ 0000 instead of $_000 .
negative	learned my lesson .
negative	don_'_t ever use them .
negative	good luck on getting your money returned to you .
negative	it '_s been over 0_weeks now and i can '_t seem to get my money back .
negative	took 00_minutes on the phone to make a two minute confirmation .
negative	the website would not accept the group code .
negative	called and had to pay full rate since they had no record of the convention .
negative	others who had booked rooms before and after , got the discount .
negative	i am absolutely livid at bravofly .
negative	on 00 february i attempted to purchase plane_tickets from madrid to barcelona on three_separate_occasions .
negative	first , i charged it to my visa checking card , and the next two times i used my paypal .
negative	each time i received two confirmation emails , saying the transactions could not be authorized , giving no further explanation , and saying my money would be frozen for a few_days before being returned to me .
negative	after finally realizing the error had to be from within the bravofly database , seeing as i had sufficient funds in my bank_account , i went directly to the airline '_s website and purchased the same tickets for a cheaper price , receiving confirmation immediately .
negative	obviously bravofly was too incompetent to authorize a simple purchase i was able to make within five_minutes on a different site .
negative	the money on my visa check card was frozen for over a week , making it accessible to me during my entire trip in spain .
negative	i think it is completely_unacceptable for bravofly to hold_onto my money for this long .
negative	it made budgeting more difficult , since i had essentially lost twice the amount of money on plane_ticket '_s than i had anticipated .
negative	i have made returns at stores that return my money more quickly than bravofly did .
negative	what is the reason to even hold_onto this money , when i was going to receive it anyway ?
negative	while i was in spain , i also received returned check fees , which were due to bravofly attempting to take my money out of my checking_account through my paypal .
negative	i checked my email and had received two invoices from bravofly , pretending as if my purchases had then been authorized or wanted .
negative	even if they had been suddenly authorized , it was too late for my me to use the tickets , as it was after the date i was attempting to buy them for , so this again shows bravofly '_s incompetence .
negative	bravofly had attempted to take over $_000 from my account on tickets that were now useless to me , and since i still had $_000 frozen from my visa check card attempt , i obviously overdrafted .
negative	i am a college_student on a budget and this cost me more money than i can_afford to lose , especially when living on a budget .
negative	a bravofly representative responded to me , trying to blame all the error on my bank .
negative	my bank has_been the only one working with me .
negative	today , i checked my checking_account and was charged via_paypal for the useless tickets .
negative	i am absolutely furious that despite my emails contacting bravofly , i am still charged for these things .
negative	it is completely unfair of bravofly is freeze a person '_s money if they are too incompetent to complete a transaction , let_alone three .
negative	i will never use bravofly again .
negative	what a joke website .
negative	the money it has cost me could have paid for more plane_tickets .
negative	i question whether i would book my flights with this agent again .
negative	i booked my flights some time ago through the travel_agent bravo_fly
negative	i called the agent outlining the unsuitability of the rescheduled flight and was told to be patient while they found her a suitable flight .
negative	i made it clear she was willing to fly early on the saturday_morning alternatively , should they be unable to schedule the friday_night flight ( fri 00th_march ).
negative	no further communication followed from the travel_agent or airline until i again called two_weeks before departure and was simply told to be patient , she will find out her travel_arrangements soon ( spoke to elizabeth ).
negative	nothing was heard for another week .
negative	a colleague then rang on my behalf the morning of monday 00th of march , it was necessary to call three_times as she was hung_up on twice , which as i am sure you can appreciate , is very frustrating and extremely poor customer_relations .
negative	she spoke to rasheeda from bmi then who informed me that the 00 . 00 flight on friday 00th was still flying and had remaining seats , in addition there was a flight on the saturday_morning ( 00st march ) at 00 . 00 .
negative	she then had to call the travel_agent back with this information and wait for a response .
negative	this would seem to suggest to me very poor communication and correspondence between agent and airline regarding availability and made it quite clear that resolving customer dissatisfaction really is not given the priority it should be .
negative	i , michelle was emailed an itinerary the monday_evening ( 00th_march ) for the 00 . 00 flight on 00st march .
negative	there was no further mention of any changes to the 00 . 00 bd000 flight departing london heathrow monday 0nd april .
negative	it was not until repeated failed_attempts to check in online the monday_morning ( using both e_- ticket number and booking reference as above ) that i rang bmi customer_service and was informed it was best to be at the airport three hours in advance , the representative i spoke to on the phone could not see where the problem was occurring .
negative	whatever plans we had made for the monday_morning were cancelled as we proceeded to heathrow_airport to check in .
negative	there we were told by the bmi customer_service representative that the flight bd000 is ‘ non_- existent ’.
negative	the only solution she proposed was to put us both on the 00 . 00 flight that evening ( mon 0nd ), two hours_later than we had intended .
negative	when asked why such an_error occurred or who is responsible , the representative claimed she did not know and that she supposed it was ‘ 00 - 00 : between airline and travel_agent ).
negative	i am entirely disappointed about the course of events that occurred from the time the flights were booked , 00 weeks in advance of departure , right up until our time in the airport flying home , where no attempt at any sort of apology or minor compensation was offered .
negative	michelle o ’ driscoll .
negative	useless ... it still has not arrived
negative	difficult to look at anything , hard to navigate , always had an_issue when trying to place the same order ,
negative	this company is super helpful whilst trying to get your business and during the fitting , but if you have an_issue afterwards then god help you !
negative	the after care service is simply shocking and completely_unacceptable .
negative	i have an_issue with the splash back behind my cooker and it needs replacing .
negative	i contacted the company about the issue on 00th_february and was asked to email over a picture which i did the next_day .
negative	i heard_nothing back after this .
negative	i chased up by phone on several_occasions to no_avail , i was then informed in mid march that i should have in fact sent my picture over to steve godden which i then did on 00th_march and still i have had no response from the company !
negative	i have phoned 0 times since the 00th_march and he is never there , i have left messages for him to call me stating how unhappy i am with the service and still nothing !!!
negative	absolutely disgusting , once they have had your money they don_'_t care !
negative	claim to have delivered a parcel obtained a signature and to have gps evidence of all this .
negative	however they did not deliver to this i address .
negative	i cannot get a credit for my order and they have sent a ridiculous squiggle to the sender as evidence they did deliver .
negative	. a joke and clearly dont care who they cheat or malign .
negative	be warned find a trustworthy courier that doesnt lie .
negative	even after paying for shipping , it took 0 whole weeks for my book to be delivered .
negative	i wrote to have them check on it after a week and they did nothing but copy and paste the same tracking_information i had referenced in my email .
negative	shipping took far too long and customer_service was incredibly rude .
negative	i couldn_'_t talk to anyone because of the lack of a phone_number and the email response was curt and unhelpful .
negative	i had a second charge to my account with no_explanation for it .
negative	i was totally disappointed in the quality of the goods and the lack of protective_packaging .
negative	they arrived broken at the top , the lights did not work and having tested the bulbs seperately one did not work .
negative	i was wry disappointed as i didn_'_t get paid and they also said i sent in substandard items and didn_'_t return or pay for them emailed and no response time wasters
negative	macy '_s delivery service is the worst ever , and they do not care about their customers at all .
negative	i needed a new bed to recover from major_surgery and made the mistake of buying it from macy '_s instead of an " impersonal " online competitor because i had more confidence in the delivery - service part of the deal .
negative	huge mistake !
negative	they say they " offer " a 0 - hr delivery window but instead what they require is for the customer to be available all day long , to wait for 0 - hr time window to be dictated to them via automated_message 0 days in - advance ( and if the customer happens to have a scheduling conflict with that time - window , the only option is to go back into the queue waiting for that process to repeat itself ).
negative	there is no attempt to actually find out from the customer when is the most convenient timeframe for them to receive delivery ( not even am vs . pm ).
negative	when my delivery ( that i had already had to wait 00 days for , in order to meet their delivery terms ) was understandably delayed_due to a winter_storm , the rep i initially spoke to couldn_'_t care less that i needed this item within the next 0 days ( either after 0pm or anytime on sat ) for serious medical reasons , all she could do was read her script and tell me the " next available " delivery date .
negative	then when i emailed and said i was going to cancel my order if it wasn_'_t delivered when i needed it to be , i received an_email response saying it would be delivered 0 days before my surgery after 0pm , and it didn_'_t show up , but the customer_service number was " closed ."
negative	when i emailed them saying please please please get it there the next_day , i seriously need it , they sent one of their " canned " responses saying i had been re - scheduled for a new delivery date 0 days out ( days after i was due to be home from surgery with no bed ).
negative	i realized i would have been much_better off ordering a bed from overstocked . com or any number of other " impersonal " online competitors ( with better prices ).
negative	i cancelled my order with macy '_s and wound_up getting a better bed for a better price from a local franchise store ( sleepy '_s ) who delivered it to me the same day ( the night before my surgery ) and it came with a free mattress pad and pillows .
negative	i am planning to buy a new king_size bed and bedroom_set in the near_future , and i can assure you i will be buying it from karen at sleepy '_s in gaithersburg , md and not from macy '_s .
negative	how many items do you think they sell / deliver at macy '_s that are actually needed by the customer for serious medical reasons ?
negative	and after they couldn_'_t find a way to get it to me for 0_weeks according to their " system ," and then had to delay the order for understandable reasons , they couldn_'_t make any exception or special accommodation for a customer in serious need of the delivery , for health reasons ?
negative	seriously , macy '_s ?
negative	shame on you .
negative	i will never shop at macy '_s again or watch your stupid thanksgiving parade on tv ever again .
negative	i hope macy '_s goes out - of - business along with all the other department_stores who got so big for their britches that they can '_t keep_up with either their online or local smaller competitors , and they have forgotten that their business revolves around the customer and not the other way around , and no_longer " care " about their customers .
negative	i will never forget the unnecessary additional stress and worry over a stupid furniture delivery that macy '_s caused me the day before major_surgery , and how it made me feel that they just really blatantly didn_'_t care if i didn_'_t have a bed to lay down in afterwards .
negative	i am so glad i cancelled the order , and found sleepy '_s instead .
negative	macy '_s doesn_'_t deserve my business .
negative	ordered a 0 door wardrobe on 00th_april with a delivery expectation of the following_day .
negative	i received an_email_informing_me that delivery would not be on friday .
negative	later a telephone_call call confirmed the wardrobe would be delivered on tuesday00th april .
negative	later in the day i telephoned the company and was advised it would be delivered .
negative	no delivery .
negative	made numerous_calls to the company requesting a call back .
negative	finally i was told that they would contact the delivery company to contact me .
negative	no communication was received .
negative	on thursday , 0st may it finally arrived , only it was a 0 door and a 0 door .
negative	the driver was surly .
negative	however , we did not accept the delivery as it was not as ordered .
negative	we requested our money back .
negative	we have been told delivery of the same items will be made on 0nd may and if we reject them then we will have to pay £_00 .
negative	the item is not as_advertised and if we had known this then clearly we would not have ordered ,
negative	never again will i order from this company .
negative	the worst thing is that they do not seem to care whether the customer is satisfied .
negative	the bouquet received was nothing like the picture online .
negative	only 0 roses in a bunch costing over_£_00 with no vase as the picture showed .
negative	ordered for monday and dead by tuesday .
negative	no actual flower card displaying a message , just a discount card with scribble on the back .
negative	i can not recommend this florist .
negative	i ordered .
negative	you charged me .
negative	he never got it .
negative	i complained .
negative	you said you rectified it .
negative	he never got it .
negative	i complained again .
negative	he still_hasn_'_t received it .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	the rep i spoke with had no_idea how to fix the reservation once she realized she had made a mistake .
negative	i clarified for her several_times and by then we lost the available two rooms .
negative	i asked twice to speak to her supervisor .
negative	the first time she put me on hold for over 0 minutes .
negative	she then came back & said she now knew how to " fix " it , but was unable to .
negative	i asked a second time for a supervisor .
negative	again , i had to wait .
negative	when he came on , he too was unable to get us the rooms at hyatt_place , but located our two rooms for us at the hampton that was several miles_away from where we needed to be .
negative	we were very displeased with this experience .
negative	i thought i was speaking to someone at the hotel , not a booking service , then he books me for a different hotel chain ( which would have been fine ) at a hotel that i thought he said was in the same town , but it was 00_minutes away !!!
negative	i called right back 0 minutes later , and am still_waiting for a refund of almost $_000 0 days_later !!
negative	ugh !!
negative	horrible experience , and i spelled my name 0 times and he still was not close to spelling it right !!
negative	!
negative	not happy with the seemingly resultant issues i have encountered since using this service to book my hotel reservation .
negative	i received a fraud_alert from my credit_card , with the last transaction to book the hotel .
negative	the booking agent did not identify herself as expedia , something i learned after the fraud_alert .
negative	in attemting to call to report this incident , i have been placed on hold for 00_minutes , no agent to take the call .
negative	i disconnected the call , called back , and on hold for 00_minutes , finally disconnecting the call .
negative	not the type of service one would expect .
negative	the number 000 - 000 - 0000 needs to provide more prompt attention to the callers .
negative	i needed a radiator for my ' 00 corolla awd wagon , and i picked a " 0 " row radiator from metrix , part number w0000 - 0000000 .
negative	the factory radiator is a 0 row , they sell this as a 0 row , but when you receive it , you quickly see , it has one row that is skinnier and a tad longer_than one row of the factory radiator , which has 0 rows , and has a skinny little block down the middle of the one row .
negative	the car over heats as much as it did with a stock radiator , with the whole top tank cracked .
negative	the radiator is half as thick , so it has half the cooling area that the stock one has , and is no better_than a 0 row .
negative	our experience with saigon0muine was terrible .
negative	we had pre_- paid and our driver was over an_hour and a half late to pick us up from the airport in nha trang .
negative	we called the company several_times , at first they said he was there and just couldn_'_t see us which made no sense as there were only 0 or so drivers waiting for customers .
negative	this turned_out to be a lie and the truth was they couldn_'_t get in contact with the driver .
negative	the woman on the phone was rude and unhelpful .
negative	she was completely unsympathetic that we had been waiting so long and that we had a 0 hour drive ahead of us .
negative	when i asked for a partial_refund of some kind i was flat out refused .
negative	i was only offered a small discount the next time we booked with them , which obviously i refused to do as i didn_'_t get the impression from the company that they would be making an effort next time .
negative	they really didn_'_t seem to care that they had kept us waiting for that long at the airport with no answers as to what was happening and when we could expect to get picked_up .
negative	shocking !
negative	i would go with another company or catch a taxi .
negative	when we enquired with several taxi drivers they were happy to match the price ( we didn_'_t go with them in the end because i wasn_'_t confident saigon0muine would give me a refund ).
negative	do not use this company !
negative	i recently bought inks for my printer , on changing theicoloured ink my printer would not accept either of the two new inks purchased , i did as advised on your website and used a damp kitchen roll to no_avail .
negative	i have used your inks in my printer since new , but now i have to find a new supplier as i cannot_afford to pay forty pounds and only get two black_ink i can use .
negative	i found the website , and oredered 0 unlocked cell_phones .
negative	the two more_expensive ones were not unlocked , or partially ...
negative	i could call and receive calls on the one i was going to keep for myself , but with full qwerty keyboard , i wanted to be able to text .
negative	well , i could not ever text .
negative	the most expensive phone , simply did not recognize sim cards from different carriers or work at all .
negative	than comes the problem of trying to contact them .
negative	i created a ticket at the help center .
negative	i emailed support .
negative	i emailed survey people .
negative	i emailed anyone from the company who '_s email i could get for help .
negative	thus_far , > 0weeks trying , i '_ve gotten no responses .
negative	any suggestions / help , would be appreciated .
negative	thanks , ma ' am
negative	purchase a lot of clothes from superdry online and in the store , as my son and husband wear superdry clothes , had a few problems in the past t shirts with logo fade when item washed first time , had no_problems at all with exchanging them .
negative	recently_purchased online 0 xxl t shirts my husband took the label off and put the t shirt on ready to wear out and found it was actually too big a lot bigger_than the other xxl we purchased .
negative	i decided to send back as the size was extreme to all his other xxl and replace with xl .
negative	to my amazement i received an_email_saying from superdry the t shirt had been washed and they would not replace .
negative	the t shirt had most definitely not been washed and for the sake of £_00 would not take to the extreme of bothering to send back and a reply email explaining my disappointment in hannah oxenburys untrue assumptions that the t shirt had been washed !
negative	to my amazement she didn_'_t even have the courtesy to reply to me .
negative	very dissatisfied and certainly will not be parting with any more money to them in the future !
negative	amazing how one persons decision and comments has given superdry one less customer !
negative	lets_hope she doesn_'_t give that impression to too many other customers as its a very competitive world and people now think_twice about who they part their money with !
negative	i believe this is the first time i have heard from anyone at ig .
negative	how much am i paying for this service ?
negative	and how do i know it is working ???
negative	?
negative	hello ???!
negative	i guess ig doesn_'_t know either ??
negative	?
negative	i am sorry you do not have a human there ???
negative	?
negative	don_'_t get my questions_answered ...
negative	all it is , is to get sales calls .
negative	they won_'_t tell you a thing about getting a grant .
negative	we were very disappointed with our flights from delays with no attempt to get us on a better flight .
negative	we paid at extra 00 . 00 per_night for a deluxe room at the hotel and were met with staff that didn_'_t care and put us in the most tiny room , no window with foot of the bed nearly touching the wall !
negative	moved to new room and key didn_'_t work , third time back to desk etc now it was after 00 : 00_pm .
negative	return flight tried to route us to chicago from new_orleans to reach oklahoma around midnight in bad_weather ... ugh !
negative	missed several standbys to finally reach home .
negative	did not like that they asked for my bank_account password .
negative	you should never give that information .
negative	i worked at a major bank and we always cautioned customers not to share their passwords .
negative	i talked with customer_service on 0 / 00 about a dress for my daughter , after my local dress shop couldn_'_t get the dress in time for prom .
negative	shipping said 0 - 0 days and customer_service confirmed that date , so i ordered the dress .
negative	they claim 00_% in stock , which is bs , they have dresses but no size selection .
negative	my local shop owner called me and i told her about the order , she then told me that the manufacturer had none of the dresses in stock and shipment from china would be after prom .
negative	she called her manufacturer '_s rep and she confirmed this for me .
negative	i called missesdressy and was told that they would email me in 00_hours to give me the ship date , after they order the dress .
negative	i told them there were no dresses and i was told that from the manufacturer and if you were ordered why would you say 0 - 0 days when you don_'_t even know if it '_s in stock ????
negative	i decided to wait for the email , but i read some reviews and realized i was taken and this is normal practice for missesdressy . com .
negative	take the order , take the money , make a false shipment promise , and then they have your money .
negative	i called again and was immediately put on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i called from another phone , while on hold , and was hung_up on twice .
negative	i called no fewer than 0 times in 0 hours , never talking to anyone , other than " can you hold ,.... click !"
negative	.
negative	i called my credit_card and started a dispute claim for the charge .
negative	i called missesdressy again and finally_reached the same person i spoke to earlier .
negative	i swear 0 people work here .
negative	i told her i was not paying for a dress that wasn_'_t going to arrive and she told me that they don_'_t cancel orders .
negative	i then told her i already called to report a fraudulent charge to my credit_card company and amazingly her story changed and i was transferred to a " supervisor ".
negative	she answered the phone with " hello ", no introduction , no can i help you , nothing but hello .
negative	i told her my story and i wanted a full_refund and she did it .
negative	i told her i wouldn_'_t hang up until i was emailed a confirmation on my cancellation , which she did .
negative	this company is a joke !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my husband placed a order on 0 - 00 - 00 for delivery on 0 - 00 - 00 .
negative	i was never e_- mailed my conformation order as_promised .
negative	my bank_account was charged $_00 . 00 on 0 - 00 - 00 .
negative	flowers were never delivered and i have attempted to contact the company via_e_- mail and phone since 00 - 00 - 00 .
negative	i have never received a response back from the company .
negative	i went through their automated_system as if i was placing a new order and my call was answered to only be told they are a answering service and had no access to my order .
negative	i was also told that customer_service was closed and their hours of operation are from 0 : 00 a . m . to 0 p . m . even_though the website clearly_states they are open 00 / 0 000 days a year .
negative	the answering service who places the order suggested that i contact bbb and dispute it with my bank .
negative	they informed me that they are bombarded with angry customers all the time .
negative	flower delivery express states guaranteed delivery if the order is placed two_days in advance on high peak days .
negative	my order was placed 0 days in advance .
negative	i have filed a report with bbb and my next step is contacting my bank to dispute the charge .
negative	please read_reviews before placing any orders with this company .
negative	what good is it to receive valentine '_s day flowers after the actual date .
negative	thank_god my husband figureds out this company was a scam by 0 - 00 - 00 and ordered a additional bouquet from out local_florist .
negative	when was the last time you reserved a room anywhere and paid ahead of time ?
negative	we reserved a room for the nights of mar .
negative	00 and 00 a few_days ago .
negative	when checking my bank_statement i found that travelocity had already billed us for the reservation .
negative	that is the first time in all our travels that payment was already charged .
negative	we consider this an unfair practice and will never deal with travelocity again .
negative	bait and switch tactics not acceptable
negative	i ordered three outdoor tables and two chairs and was quoted $_000 for shipping .
negative	i had to wait 0 months for the chair and they charged my credit_card .
negative	i kept emailing them to see why it never arrived .
negative	i have to email them 0 times to get one answer a few_days_later .
negative	they told me 0 months later that i would have to pay $ 0000 usd for shipping and it would be shipped to the airport and not even to my home !
negative	i am not paying that much for shipping when i was never told so the price when i ordered it 0 months_ago .
negative	i would not have ordered it from them .
negative	they told me they were going to refund me for the tables and chairs over a month_ago and still have not received refund or my order !!!!
negative	they are not honest and do not do_business with them !!!
negative	!
negative	some of the flowers lasted just two_days , these were the roses , the tulips lasted four days i would have expected at the very least seven_days plus the flowers were left_outside the main complex ?????
negative	very poor show .......
negative	i do not like identity_guard .
negative	i was promised i would get my 0 scores every_month for free .
negative	it never happened .
negative	i only got it when i signed_up .
negative	i am trying to purchase a home and monitor my credit .
negative	this service did not help at all .
negative	we received a delivery from myhermes , my husband heard a knock at the door and got up to answer it , before he reached the living_room door there was a pounding at the door and as he headed down the stairs there was a 0rd hammering .
negative	as he opened the door the delivery agent was already talking to our elderly neighbour , asking if she would take the parcel .
negative	the agent must have knocked her door at the same time as ours as it takes the elderly lady a while to shuffle to her door , it only took my husband less_than 00 seconds to answer , he was furious not only that she ' d knocked , no , banged , 0 times but that she had disturbed our neighbour for no good reason .
negative	her excuse was that she had to get a move on .
negative	as we ' d been expecting the delivery the previous day i quite believe that she was behind schedule but her behaviour was entirely inappropriate .
negative	my husband used to work nights , that amount of knocking would have woken him but obviously there ' d have been no - one there by the time he got to the door and would have been infuriating .
negative	i '_m deeply disappointed by her behaviour and would certainly never use this company myself .
negative	i booked a 00 day rental in florida , prepaid entire amount and recieved a voucher good for alamo .
negative	went to pick_up car with family and luggage and alamo said the voucher was only good for non us drivers_license holders !!
negative	i paid about $_000 through carhire0000 , which was half the price of direct alamo and it was only good for non us ??
negative	but when they took my money they knew from my credit_card info that my address was us !
negative	i paid alamo about 0000 $ for the 00 day rental because i was stuck and it was a holiday_period .
negative	so i call carhire0000 and they say because i did not pick_up the car and because i did not cancel within 0 days , i would be charged 0 days fee whcih they calculated to be $_000 !
negative	i only paid $_000 for 00 days and they werre charging me $_000 !!
negative	they told me the terms and conditions , which ran over 000 small_print words , required me to be non us license holder .
negative	i could not find it in the terms and conditions before i booked , but did find it in the voucher .
negative	so what ?
negative	why didnt they put in in big letters so i could read it ??
negative	i had my credi card company dispute the charges and agter much back and forth , i got the credit .
negative	dont use them .
negative	horrible customer_service and really nasty people .
negative	trust_pilot is obviously more efficient than fabriah as i '_m being asked for review before receiving the goods i have ordered from fabriah !
negative	0 / 00 / 00 0 :_00am cst
negative	you just sent me an_email_telling_me there was activity on my account and i needed to check it .
negative	i cannot get into my account because i get an_error_message that says my credit_card account is about to expire or has expired therefore i need to give you another credit_card before i can use the service you charge me for every_month .
negative	my account with american_express does not expire until 0 / 00 / 00 and amex is mailing the new card the middle of this month .
negative	the card is good until 0 / 00 / 00 and i have no spending limit .
negative	why did you not check with amex yourself to see if my credit_card was good ?
negative	i spoke to your agent yesterday named chris and she said there would be no problem with me accessing my account even with the message credit_card expired .
negative	i could not access identity_guard yesterday that is why i had to call and speak to chris , she got me into the account .
negative	don_'_t send me an_email with a warning and then not let_me into the account .
negative	you have no service open until 0am est , you need 00 / 0 support service open .
negative	if there is fraud / hack into my account because of your action and inaction , i will sue you .
negative	what type of service are you operating ?
negative	i am totally disgusted with identity_guard
negative	member #_00000000
negative	worst company , paid $_000 for glasses , prescription lens strength was wrong , sent in a copy of the prescription , denied mistake , did not follow the prescription .
negative	poor customer_service , called 0 times no calls returned , stated i would be called back by 00 am , told i would be called back by 0 pm , no call backs , left voice_mail .
negative	do not buy from this company !
negative	!
negative	worst on line experience , wasted alot of time and money !
negative	!
negative	i ordered sunglasses two_weeks_ago , and had sent an_email to customer_service and had still had no response .
negative	despite reading a few bad_reviews i thought i would give vision_direct a try as they did have many good reviews .
negative	i
negative	i have had no response from the customer_service team and not even any notification that the item is delayed .
negative	my status has_been showing stock confirmed for over a week and a half .
negative	i had ordered this as a gift , thinking it would come in the shown delivery time but i was deffiantly wrong .
negative	after making my purchase at a discounted_rate i suggested to my friends that they should buy from this website too , but i have told them that their service is poor and i would have rather paid for sunglasses in full price somewhere_else that i knew would have better communication and would satisfy the customer .
negative	very disapointed that i now have no sunglasses and will have to wait for them to arrive and then ship them off to the person they were a gift for and waste money on international postage to the person as vision_direct have not delivered in time .
negative	i highly suggest you get a customer_service line as your 00 hour response by email is not adiquate .
negative	- finally recieved my order after complaing to vision_direct .
negative	to recieve the item with no manufacture warranty and a dirty box .
negative	not really happy with the transaction .
negative	waiting on a response from customer_service as to why this is the case .
negative	from the beginning this trip was horrible .
negative	long hours traveling and even worst , the bus_ride to the hotel .
negative	once at the hotel you are imprisoned by locals who will take your money using guilt .
negative	we only left the hotel once and we were broke .
negative	this all_inclusive resort is old run down and in need of a facelift .
negative	the power went out and the generators which they use to run everything were right under our window so we missed out on 0 nights of sleep .
negative	the beach is small , there is no area to snorkel , and the pools are filthy .
negative	you will be unable to make phone_calls or use the internet without paying a lot of money .
negative	the staff are not helpful and actually quite rude when you needed any kind of assistance .
negative	the food was mediocre at best .
negative	seemed like most visitors were only interested in one thing , purchasing marijuana and smoking it in the hotel , the halls reeked .
negative	do not bother with jamaica and ocho rios go to the bahamas .
negative	we were truly disappointed in the $ 0000 for an " all_inclusive " resort vacation .
negative	returned emails as long as they thought i was a new customer but when they realized i wanted my money back they not only did not answer me they ignored paypal .
negative	paypal closed my complaint because the number they provided could not even prove the battery had been shipped .
negative	oh it was shipped alright .
negative	to me .
negative	dead and unusable and then back to them they still will not acknowledge they have my money and their lousy broken battery .
negative	do not trust these idiots .
negative	they either dont understand_english or they just dont care .
negative	when i made my reservation the person i spoke with seemed a little confused so i asked him to repeat my reservation several_times .
negative	he assured_me i had gotten the room i requested but when i got my reservation , it was wrong .
negative	i immediated called customer_service and they told me to give them 00_hours and they would research the problem and get back to me .
negative	after 00_hours i called and gave them my itinerary_number and even with tech_support the person i spoke with could not help me even after i was placed on hold .
negative	i am still_waiting to hear back and my credit_card has_been charged for a room that does not meet my needs .
negative	i paid an extra $_00 for a room with a water view in chicago .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel , we were told there were no rooms with a view available .
negative	so basically i paid_extra for the possibility of having a water view .
negative	the hotel manager was great and gave_us a $_00 gift_card at their restaurant .
negative	but it just does not feel right that expedia took extra money for a room upgrade and gave_us nothing in return .
negative	i will not use site again .
negative	parcel was pick_up assured it would be delivered safely with speed .
negative	it arrived on time contents smashed to bits .
negative	both sender and buyer both bitterly disappointed that it appeared no care was taken .
negative	it appears to have been thrown around like a house brick .
negative	would you recommend this company ?
negative	the answer is no .
negative	we arrived at windsor to stand in a line for 00_minutes to get tickets , then had to rush through the self - guided_tour .
negative	back on the bus for a long drive to stonehenge … not enough time to even do the audio - tour .
negative	then back on the bus to arrive in oxford where our guide quickly lost our entire group by walking into a crowd and disappearing .
negative	but it really didn_'_t matter because we arrived so late that everything worth seeing was already closed .
negative	think before booking all three of these attractions for one day .
negative	i did not like these hose , did not last over two_days .
negative	i am a hostess and i am easy on my hose but these got runs in them the second day i put them on .
negative	they are not worth the money i paid for them . thanks a lot .
negative	when we arrived at ramada , we asked the person at the front_desk if we could incorporate our aarp or aaa_discount .
negative	we were surprised to find out that the room had been booked and pre_- paid through_expedia .
negative	i assured the front_desk personnel that i had not used expedia .
negative	they explained how expedia had cloaked itself in the ramada branding to the point that we actually thought we were booking through the ramada plaza itself .
negative	we could not add a discount because our credit_card had already been charged for our room by expedia and pre_- paid .
negative	i probably got a good deal through_expedia , but i don_'_t trust expedia .
negative	the experience with expedia left me feeling that they are sneaky and underhanded .
negative	as for my experience with the ramada plaza minneapolis , it was great !
negative	we will_definitely stay there again ... but we '_ll beware , next time .
negative	j ' ai moins de 00 ans , et ai découvert en arrivant chez le loueur de voitures qu ' il fallait que_je m ' acquitte de 000 $ supplémentaires et non inclus dans_les frais payés à autoescape .
negative	de plus , ces frais n ' étaient absolument pas mentionnés par autoescape avant le paiement , mais seulement après , dans_le prepaid voucher .
negative	il serait plus honnête qu ' autoescape inclut ces frais dans_la somme réglée .
negative	de plus , j ' ai aussi découvert que pour_la même voiture , sans passer par autoescape j ' aurais payé $_000 c ' est - à - dire 000 €, soit environ 00 € de moins que les 000_€ réglés à autoescape .
negative	i placed an order for a few items .
negative	i never received a confirmation_email when i placed the order or when the order shipped .
negative	i asked about my order by_clicking on the " contact us " button , where they tell you they '_ll get back to you within 00_hours ( not including weekends ).
negative	well , it took them 0 business days to get back to me regarding my order .
negative	they told me it did ship a few_days prior and they gave_me a tracking_number .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my order and it '_s 0 business days passed the expected delivery date that it says online when i track it .
negative	i love this website .
negative	i '_ve placed multiple orders and have never had an_issue whatsoever .
negative	an item ordered in stock took payment and had to wait 0 days for this to be dispatched let_alone delivered , contacted via_email twice to which i recieved no reply even after 0 days .
negative	still_haven_'_t recieved the item over a week_later .
negative	would never use them again .
negative	i ordered the brake_light on february 0 , 0000 and the part has yet to be delivered .
negative	thirteen days ???????
negative	?
negative	the item i ordered did not turn up and when i contacted all beauty i was told to wait 00 working days after the order was dispatched , only to be advised that the item was out of stock !
negative	!
negative	i placed my order on 00 may 00 for a pair of ray_ban sunglasses that were listed as fast shipping , i . e they would ship within 00 - 00_hours .
negative	i presumed ( wrongly ) that the web address meant that the company was in australia and therefore that my glasses would be shipped from australia ; i expected to have them quickly .
negative	i received my order confirmation in which i was told that in the unlikely_event that there was a problem they would contact me immediately .
negative	on checking my order status 0 days_later , it had changed to ' discontinued '.
negative	i had received no communication from vd that there was a problem .
negative	i tried_phoning them using the number listed on paypal ; that was in hong_kong and disconnected .
negative	they had another email address in the uk which i emailed but have had no response .
negative	interestingly , they were still selling the sunglasses i wanted on their website even at this stage !
negative	after polite and ' form letter ' style emails from their customer_service people in response to my contact , i was offered a 00_%_discount on another pair of sunglasses of my choice .
negative	i accepted their offer and emailed them with the details of the new sunglasses within a few hours on 00th .
negative	here i was thinking that finally my sunglasses would be on there way .
negative	but on checking my order yesterday ( 00th ) i have discovered that the wrong sunglasses have been despatched to me - i am still_waiting for a tracking_number to find out where they are .
negative	i wrote an_email and have been told that they will exchange the glasses for the ones i had ordered but i would need to fill_out a return form and send them back , paying for the postage , that they would then reimburse_me .
negative	the glasses i want will take 0 to 00 working days to provide but of course this won_'_t happen until i return the glasses that have been sent to me from somewhere in the world .
negative	i have sent an_email_asking someone to phone me , as i was told they would do if i requested , but i only get email platitudes in response .
negative	i believe that these problems could have been prevented , and my sunglasses provided much more quickly and hence my level of satisfaction markedly higher if someone from vd had bothered to pick_up the phone and call me when they first discovered that the sunglasses i wanted were discontinued .
negative	this was my test order before ordering prescription_glasses .
negative	given that vd are unable to fill a simple sunglasses order in a timely way , then there is no chance that i am going to order prescription_glasses from them .
negative	beware of vd - they are not australian based and they are not the good customer_service company they would have you believe they are from their web_site .
negative	first my daughters favorite flower is a sunflower and i needed them bad to make her smile , you see her gracie died sunday her sweet dog .
negative	on monday i called and ordered a " deluxe sunflower bouquet " and today my daughter received a small bouquet with green pom mums , black eyed susans , yellow_roses but the reason i called and selected sunflowers were very scarce i could only see two sunflowers in the picture she sent me .... to me a big_disappointment !!!!!!
negative	so i called customer_service what a laugh ... she argued that i ordered a " golden blooms arrangement " but my receipt shows the picture of the sunflowers so i thought i was getting what i ordered but no they decided what i wanted .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled by their pictures on their website to me a complete_waste of money and all i was trying do is make my daughter feel better .
negative	i '_m sorry my darling mom tried .....
negative	i called the number given on the internet when i looked up my hotel .
negative	when andy answered she did not tell me it was a 0rd_party reservations service .
negative	i then spoke to rafael who messed_up everything from my name to the type of room , how many nights and the dates i would like ...
negative	asked for supervisor & finally made my reservations , only to find that without telling_me , this service removed money from my card immediately ... for the cancelled booking as well as the current one .
negative	then i found out that people in the hotel paid less_than i did with another service .
negative	i will never use your service again .
negative	i ordered a box of parts , all from the same warehouse .
negative	there was nothing too complicated , some belts , filters , gaskets , drain plugs .
negative	i was missing a couple parts .
negative	they were printed on my packing_slip but not sent .
negative	i filled out a support_ticket that took_forever for someone to reply to and tried to call many_times but no one ever answers .
negative	the customer_service reply was for a return which was not my case .
negative	i had nothing to return .
negative	so i had to reply and wait forever for a response again .
negative	i bought the parts i needed somewhere_else .
negative	i still have not received my refund and its been nearly a month .
negative	i regret ever using them to buy parts .
negative	0 .
negative	website would not let_me add items to my cart , tried several_times .
negative	finally had to call .
negative	0 .
negative	charged me $ 0 . 00 processing_fee .
negative	wtf , what business charges a " processing_fee "?
negative	i order from the internet all the time .
negative	no business has ever charged such a fee .
negative	if i had been ordering for myself , i would have cancelled the order , over two dollars !
negative	0 .
negative	website said if i signed_up for emails , i would receive free_shipping .
negative	rep says ,'" oh no , not the additional shipping_charges , they are never eliminated ."
negative	0 .
negative	the item i ordered has_been back - ordered .
negative	they hope it will ship in about three_weeks .
negative	after all this , i can '_t give them a very good review .
negative	sure hope the item is what my father - in -_law wants because i have a feeling trying to return it would be a nightmare .
negative	first of all the s &_h price is ridiculous .
negative	i mean 00 dollars for shipping and handling ?
negative	i don_'_t even pay that much when i order things from fuckin china or canada .. it '_s way too much considering the fact that your company is in the u . s ( california )....
negative	it '_s been a week and a couple of days since i placed my order and yet nothing .... no updates .. the tracking_number i was given does not even work ... i really wish i read the reviews befor i place my order .
negative	this company needs to get thier shit together because they can '_t be messing up like this .. people work hard for thier money and i can '_t afford for y ' all to be messing up ... if two_weeks hit without my shoes being delivered ( not picked_up ) to my house .
negative	i would need a full_refund !
negative	ordered a wheelbarrow for my gardening mad mum .
negative	got email_confirmation of my order , advised delivery 0 - 0 working days .
negative	0 days_later a phone_call came saying the item wasn_'_t meant to be on sale and i wont be getting a wheelbarrow .
negative	furthermore it was too late to order another before mums_birthday .
negative	won_'_t be using this website again .
negative	i gave a one star_rating because there is no negative stars to give !
negative	it has_been 0_weeks and i have not received my items !
negative	!
negative	emailed several_times and the customer_service actually emailed me back with this --" during busy periods a response may take slightly_longer , however please rest_assured that there is no need to resend your email .
negative	we have received it and you will receive a response from a member of our customer care team at the earliest opportunity ."
negative	well , apparently nobody even_bother to email me back and let_me know what '_s going on with my items !
negative	it just simply doesn_'_t make any sense to give me a tracking_number if i cannot track it at all .....
negative	what a big_disappointment and i will never ever buy from topman again .. horrible !
negative	placed an order for next_day delivery on january 00 , order was delivered on january 00nd .
negative	the web_site wasn_'_t working , so could not track my order or send in contact sheet .
negative	plus there was no phone_number to call in the emails or the website .
negative	my brother mark got delayed on his flight in grand junction , colorado by united_airlines , so he didn_'_t get his connection in denver , so there for they are flying him to seattle where they told him he has to pay for his own room .
negative	they suck .
negative	never , never fly with united_airlines .
negative	the person i talked to was very hard to understand .
negative	i finally hung_up and called back thinking i would get someone_who i could understand .
negative	the next person was not much_better .
negative	i was never told that the credit_card would be billed immediately .
negative	never told that the cancellation_policy was different than that of the hotel .
negative	i will call the hotel itself from here on out .
negative	ordered the item from website and received the item but in a different colour_scheme .
negative	contacted the customer_services department for the company and was told that the website states that " colour may vary from that ordered ".
negative	i checked the website and found no such warning .
negative	i was asked to take photos and email them as if i could not tell the difference_between red and cream .
negative	i was then told that they had contacted the warehouse who had checked that a replacement item was the correct colour and would be dispatched and the wrong_colour item collected .
negative	i then took delivery of the new item and guess what ?
negative	the new item was the wrong_colour as before !
negative	at this point i realised that the company probably does not have the item as displayed on its website .
negative	i told them that i am withdrawing payment for the item and was informed that this could result in a bad debt recorded against my name .
negative	my credit_card company has now withdrawn payment and i '_ve ordered the item from a different company which has arrived all as ordered no_problems .
negative	still not out of the woods yet as the 0nd item needs to be collected .
negative	stayed at home ( again ) all day yesterday ( the promised collection day ) and no one called .
negative	just got an_email from the company claiming city_link called at 0 . 00pm yesterday got no reply so i owe them £ 0 !
negative	i was at home waiting all day .
negative	0 days spent at home so_far in total for deliveries and collections for nothing , still , have plenty of time to write this review
negative	i ordered a hood latch for my vw_beetle i never received my part !
negative	i used my debit visa_card for this transaction and the money was deducted .
negative	i will never order another thing from this site again !!
negative	!
negative	poor service , rude staff , disorganised will not buy anything from this place .
negative	we ordered a sofa from sofa works over the phone in the end .
negative	i would not have ordered one from the local_store in crewe because of the tacky attitude of the manager and only ordered from sofaworks because we couldn_'_t find what we wanted any where else .
negative	the advertising matches the tacky attitude of the crewe manager and the sloath really needs getting_rid of .
negative	my opinion only and well - you did ask for it .
negative	my husband is in the military and we decided to book a vacation since we hadn_'_t had one in a few_years .
negative	we were very excited to book our tickets .
negative	we also purchase the insurance / waiver .
negative	my husband had an_unexpected problem that he had to attend to at work and now this company says i have to pay them $_000_per change fee even_though it will be refunded to me the same day plus $_000 extra for our hotel .
negative	they blamed it on the hotel and said they had nothing to do with the increase in price .
negative	yet , i checked the hotel myself and actually the date we were moving it to was cheaper_than the price we purchased the ticket for .
negative	they are crooks and we will never book with them again .
negative	it is a total scam .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	ordered a cover on sept 00th , was told it would be here within 0 days , here it is oct . 0th still nothing .
negative	my acct says " still processing_".
negative	a severe storm was heading our way and we didn_'_t want to have to get all the leaves and debris out again , so we went and bought one at a local namco , which certainly was our last resort .
negative	i have been reading panini comics since i was little , they cover all the major marvel characters and now some of the dc ones also .
negative	living in the uk , where it is hard to get hold of comics , these series ' are brilliant and cover all the major story - lines ( eventually - they do run about 0 - 0 years behind the usa comics ).
negative	when i first started reading and collecting these i had my local newsagents put them up for me but nowadays i subscribe to them and get them all delivered to my door , this service is far easier , as you don_'_t have to worry_about forgetting to collect them each_month and there are also deals that save you money if you subscribe to multiple issues .
negative	however , now the service has gone down hill drastically .
negative	panini comics no_longer do back issues ( this shouldn_'_t be an_issue if you subscribe anyway however ...)
negative	lately i have not been receiving some of my issues , sometimes i get sent the wrong issue and end up with two issues of the previous months issues and sometimes a month is skipped altogether .
negative	each time this happens i contact panini and there response is ' we do not have any more copies of the missing issue and we will add another month onto the end of your subscription '.
negative	well i know that this is better_than them just ignoring the issue but what am i supposed to do about the missing issues .
negative	i have found myself having to pay up - to £ 0 / 0 on ebay to replace a missing issue , when they only cost £ 0 to buy in the first place .
negative	i advise against anyone using this subscription service and i will be going back to ordering them at my local newsagents once my subscriptions have finished .
negative	i placed an order on here totaling just under £_000 but when it came it didn_'_t fit , the note that came with it said to simply send it back and e_- mail through the size i needed and they would send out a replacement , it '_s annoying that i have to cover the cost of postage back especially as i have to send it recorded as well and it '_s really heavy but most online companies do this so as annoying as this is , i was willing to do so but i then get an e_- mail saying as the items were reduced ( and i didn_'_t even realize this when ordering from this seriously expensive site ) they would not send me replacements , despite them still selling the items and having the correct size in stock they would only offer me a refund ( minus the postage out and back ).
negative	this is terrible , i cannot_believe that a company would rather loose a £_000 sale than just send out the correct size , maddening , and now i '_m out of pocket and very annoyed so i advise you all to avoid this company
negative	they do not provide all the options they offer on their site , i requested free delivery of my item , which was one of the options offered at checkout but they then refused to deliver saying they didn_'_t offer this option but still charged me and woudn '_t refund , this case is now going through trading_standards as they are rude and ignorant and refuse to deliver what i ordered which is clearly_stated on the invoice they sent .
negative	nowhere on the product listing does it say they only offer digital codes and you could select different posting methods so why would they charge postage at all if they only sent them digitally .
negative	i selected the physical card as_pictured and described , this is there mistake which they refuse to own upto .
negative	the sheer fact that they are so rude and ignorant and won_'_t except they made a mistake shows you what a bad company they are
negative	købte for 0 mdr siden canada goose hybridge jakke til_en værdi af 0000kr , nedsat til 0000kr .
negative	ifølge beskrivelsen af jakken , skulle dette være en hårdfør udendørsjakke som producenten reklamerer med st kunne anvendes til på isklatring og rappelling - begge aktiviteter kræver særdeles hårdføre udstyr .
negative	efter et meget let fald på_en ganske almindelig græsplæne ' brændte ' materialet på ærmet af friktionen og efterlod et stort hul .
negative	jakken kan_ikke anvendes .
negative	sport00 har valgt ikke at anerkende dette som et fejl i materialet og_har afvist vores reklamation .
negative	de_har derudover valgt at vi selv skal betale for reparation af jakken .
negative	vi mener at det_er falsk reklame af jakken , at præsentere den som ' slidstærk ' og at den skulle kunne anvendes til ovennævnte aktiviteter .
negative	dette er_en dyr jakke , som har skuffet på_det groveste - og sport00 '_s håndtering ligeså .
negative	desværre .
negative	min konklusion :
negative	pas på med at stole på de produktbeskrivelser der findes på sport00 '_s hjemmeside .
negative	de vil gerne have produktet til at fremstå mere slidstærkt / bedre kvalitet end hvad det_er i den virkelige verden .
negative	forvent ikke god service hvis dit produkt efterfølgende fejler .
negative	vi vil ikke anbefale sport00 til dine fremtidige køb .
negative	i had a horrible experience with this company .
negative	sold me faulty brake_pads .
negative	cost me $_000 in mechanics fees to put bad part in , test it , and take it back out , and then wouldn_'_t even pay return shipping on the bad part .
negative	of course they didn_'_t pay the mechanic either .
negative	bad costumer_service .
negative	when i demanded at lest return shipping they hung_up on me .
negative	i have reported them to the bbb .
negative	still_waiting for my credit_card refund of part that i returned with tracking_#
negative	will not order from this company again , as not only did i pay a delivery charge when i returned the items it cost me £_00 and i have since been told neither of these charges will be refunded .
negative	i paid a price for deliver of a few envelopes and paid a courier fee .
negative	it took a week to get there - i got a package from england quicker and which cost less - disgraceful
negative	i have been a long time member of ancestry . com and have decided to probably not renew when my membership is complete .
negative	customer_service is non_- existent .
negative	what happened to e_- mail customer_service ?
negative	i find it difficult to call during the hours you have customer_service representatives available .
negative	shouldn_'_t you be making it convenient for me to contact customer_service ?
negative	i made my tree private months_ago , but people are still saving items from my tree .
negative	how are they doing that ?
negative	also , information about living people is showing up even_though i specifically have them designated as living .
negative	this is a concern for me and i cannot get an answer because i cannot call during your business hours .
negative	we booked the hotel through_travelocity . com to london for 0 days for 0 people .
negative	when we got to the hotel , we had no room available because hotel said they never received any notice from travelocity . com .
negative	they asked us to call travelocity , com for the refund .
negative	we also rent a car from travelocity . com for compact car .
negative	when we got there , we could not find in rental_car company .
negative	we asked the airport information service person .
negative	they told us that we needed to take a taxi or bus to the hotel 00_minutes away from the airport .
negative	it cost additional 0 euro person round trips .
negative	when we got to the rental_car company , we have very small car not the compact car .
negative	they said that you should pay 0 euro more per day to get the bigger car .
negative	we had very poor experience with the trip booking from travelocity . com .
negative	i have written two messages to ask what i should do with the cans of newman '_s dog_food i received .
negative	no order form was in the box .
negative	the box will remain at my desk in the office until i receive a response as to what i should do with it .
negative	i did not order this product .
negative	thank_you .
negative	don_'_t waste your time shopping with this company .
negative	if you are used to good quality shoes , fast shipping , attentive customer_service and a good refund policy then this is not the place for you .
negative	ordered two_pairs of boots , both lousy quality and smelled terrible (" synthetic leather ").
negative	customer_service number nonfunctional .
negative	when finally contacted via_e_- mail only option was store credit .
negative	i don_'_t want any more of their junk , will donate boots to the salvation army and write this off as an expensive mistake .
negative	i decided i was going to buy a leonardo dicaprio aquaracer from this company .
negative	i mean , they seemed legit for a replica watch site .
negative	i went to order , and i was taken to a separate page to pay .
negative	this seemed strange , but i '_ve used google checkout before and figured it was similar .
negative	i placed my order , and went to sleep .
negative	the next_morning , i went to use my credit_card , and it was denied .
negative	thank_god my credit_card company flagged a $ 0 , 000 purchase from macy '_s coming from an ip address from china .
negative	they denied the charge , and refunded my purchase from this site ( my credit_card company , not watchestoo . com ) this is such a sleezy scam it is disgusting .
negative	would give 0_stars if i could .
negative	i recently booked a stay for my son at an ibis hotel in the uk .
negative	i couldn_'_t see anywhere on the site that you couldn_'_t choose a smoking_room .
negative	i emailed ibis to make_sure the room he got was a smoking_room and received an_email back to say that there are no smoking_rooms .
negative	i telephoned and the lady got me to click on various tabs and icons to finally find this information !
negative	there is no refund available and it is not exactly cheap !
negative	this all happened about an_hour and a half after booking ( i emailed immediately after booking and it took an_hour and a half to receive a reply ) so you would have thought there would have been a bit of give and take !
negative	maybe i should have spent hours looking , but other_websites have that information on the front page so i didn_'_t even_bother looking further .
negative	salve ,
negative	è dal 00 di ottobre che sto aspettando una vostra risposta in merito al tipo di rimborso per_il samsung_galaxy iii .
negative	sempre nel mese di ottobre mi avevate dato conferma del rimborso , ma non mi avete più specificato di che rimborso si tratta ( altro cellulare , importo in denaro ... e quanto ?).
negative	ho chiesto di essere contattata telefonicamente ma non_ho_ricevuto telefonate .
negative	mi avete scritto circa 0 settimane fa dicendomi che_mi avreste inviato una lettera a casa .
negative	l ' avete inviata ?
negative	io non_ho_ricevuto niente .
negative	a me ora serve sapere la tipologia di rimborso e le tempistiche , contattatemi telefonicamente , il numero lo trovate in tutte le mail che vi ho inviato .
negative	grazie e cordiali saluti

negative	i called to see about my package , the girl on the other end talked and responed to my inquirer like some valley girl .
negative	dumb , and unconcern .
negative	and i called to get a return number .
negative	and another girl acted the same way .
negative	i asked her whats the address , the way she replied was like , i should know .
negative	just very unprofessional
negative	if i have a choice , i will never use your service again .
negative	you charge my cc without a problem but when it comes to adjusting the reservation you ' re completely_useless unless i want to cancel .
negative	so that '_s what i did and reserved directly w the hotel instead .
negative	i have booked 0 flights and each time it has_been difficult to get access to my stickers .
negative	website is down down down
negative	i ordered a tail_light from this website , not only did they send me the wrong part , i have yet to hear from anyone after countless emails that i have sent them .
negative	i have been calling the customer_service number for about a week now , up to 0 - 0 times a day .
negative	i have still yet to talk to anyone , and after 00_minutes of waiting each time they disconnect me , so i have no choice but to try again .
negative	i have written them so many_times that they will not accept anymore of my complaint emails , but no one will respond to me other than an_automated_response email which tells_me no one has read any of my emails .
negative	they still have not reimbursed me for the money i spent , and are also making me pay the shipping fee to send it back when i was not the one who messed the order up .
negative	if you do not want to get taken_advantage of , choose another company .
negative	partsgeek . com is not here to serve you , only to take your money and ruin your experience of online shopping .
negative	had a very bad_experience bookin with expedia .
negative	first the representative are uneducated n lied to me about star_rating .. next didn_'_t give me a refund n was on the phone for almost 0 hrs with them .
negative	just playing me around that they will give me a coupon to use on my next booking ..
negative	still couldn_'_t get a code nor a supervisor to speak to ..
negative	this is my last time dealing_with expedia ...
negative	this was my first order from 00dollarmall . com .
negative	i was excited to find such cute looking clothes for so cheap .
negative	i purchased 0 tops .
negative	i received my package and 0 of the shirts was there yet the packing_slip said 0 were included .
negative	i emailed the company and even_though it was a weekend it took til monday_evening to get back to me .
negative	they state the 0nd shirt was out of stock .
negative	why was i allowed to purchase it if it wasnt in stock ?
negative	won_'_t be buying again .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	so i ordered two bouquets for mothers_day - one for my mum and one for my boyfriend '_s mum .
negative	i received two emails on sunday_morning , saying neither delivery could be made today , as they were " very busy " and the earliest the flowers would arrive is tuesday .
negative	i complained and they offered to increase the size of the bouquet and add some chocolates .
negative	however , my boyfriend '_s mum received her flowers this morning with no upgrade , no chocolates and no apology note as_promised .
negative	and as for my poor wee mum .
negative	she '_s not getting her flowers at all .
negative	she sat in all morning waiting - but apparently teleflorist can '_t manage it today !!
negative	so i '_ve had to deliver more disappointing news to my mum , who doesn_'_t keep very well and whose children live away from home
negative	well_done teleflorist .
negative	maybe you should treat other people '_s mums the way you ' d like your mum to be treated .
negative	my ink_cartridge did not work and was not compatible with my brother_printer .. wouldn_'_t buy i actually thought this was the real one anyway from the description didn_'_t know it said compatible to .. i wouldn_'_t buy again and wasn_'_t worth sending back for $ 0
negative	had trouble with the site .
negative	unable to upload picture .
negative	got confirmation my picture was being sent .
negative	spent my money but no picture .
negative	travelocity has lousy customer_services .
negative	i was on hold for an_hour and was swiltched back and forth .
negative	the issue was never resolved .
negative	i think this is the way they handle customers to discourage the call .
negative	i will never do_business with travelocity .
negative	nor did i receive notification of shipment , and it is 0_weeks_later .
negative	what is up ?
negative	this is a present for day 0 of hannukah , and looks like we will miss the date .
negative	i orderred in plenty of time .
negative	thanks for taking my money and not delivering .
negative	i know , i know ---- they may be your only option , but the problem is that they know it too , and they treat you , the customer , like crap .
negative	i can '_t stand getting a hard_sell every time i have to call , or being sent flyers in the mail offering a great deal but then calling and finding out it '_s not offered in my rural_area , and worst of all , when they charge for something that the rep said they wouldn_'_t , nobody at comcast seems to know how to take the charge off , even if the customer_service representatives believe and agree it should be .
negative	i '_m sure this is by design .
negative	i don_'_t have time to call over every 0 or 0 dollar discrepancy on my bill , but multiply those discrepancies by the numerous comcast customers , and you '_ve got a major scam going on .
negative	i seriously dislike the policies of comcast .
negative	booked drop and go on wednesday , received no booking details , service was charged but not parking , so on saturday_morning stressed as don_'_t know whether to book elsewhere , are they going to debit my account , do i take a chance , what !
negative	cannot contact as only open mon - fri 0 - 0pm , sorry but will not use you again and thanks for getting my holiday off to a bad start and will be asking for a refund .
negative	husband brought a flight with them and had nothing but trouble .
negative	sent him a separate bill for admin charges after he got back .
negative	terrible to try and phone them , they only have a premium_rate number and there are no contact details on the internet for them , though we found they are in germany .
negative	they don_'_t respond to email or fax , though when you get through to their premium_rate number they confirm your emails have been received , they just don_'_t respond but prefer you to call their premium_rate number .
negative	he was initially told the admin charge was a mistake , then afterwards chased again by email for the payment !
negative	after phoning their premium_rate number again , was told again to ignore the emails .
negative	in the end he had threatening emails to say if it wasn_'_t paid , he would be pursued through solicitors for it !
negative	we paid it , with extra on top as it had to be paid to their german bank so cost us twice as much to transfer the money .
negative	they are a terrible company to deal with and i wouldn_'_t touch them with a barge pole !
negative	you have been warned !
negative	i ordered and paid for goods still not arrived no_explanation as to why
negative	when i made my reservation at the springhill suites hotel , i was not aware that i was not on the marriott website .
negative	this cost me my marriott rewards and my tax exempt status for the hotel taxes .
negative	in the future , i will be more careful about checking the web address for hotels when i do a google_search for a specific hotel .
negative	my order still_hasn_'_t shipped so i had to give one star .
negative	my order # is 00000000 .
negative	i placed my order on june 00 .
negative	after_spending money on next_day delivery i received an_email early hours of the day it was due to say it didn_'_t make next_day delivery .
negative	that was okay just disappointing .
negative	i was told it would make next working day .
negative	i stayed in waiting for it and it did not turn up .
negative	so i waited in the next_day for it and phoned the courier company who said that it was unable to be delivered and i would need to reschedule with them .
negative	during this time my order arrived .
negative	i do not understand this system , how it says it won_'_t be delivered then it is !
negative	when opening the package a strange fishy smell appeared .
negative	when trying the dress on it was all i could smell .
negative	the dress was completely unwearable .
negative	i will not be using boohoo again and i advise others not to .
negative	i received my radiator support in a damaged box and the ends on both were bent .
negative	had to fix it to work .
negative	i think someone should take
negative	better care of sending things to a customer .
negative	i might not deal with you with company again .
negative	i was not inpressed .
negative	getting damage goods .
negative	it sucked !
negative	i was given bad directions and we couldn_'_t find the hotel .
negative	i requested a refund and was denied !
negative	i will never book a hotel through anyone but the hotel again !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	what ever happened to customer_satisfaction ?
negative	if you have questions you can e_- mail me !
negative	hard to give review on items .
negative	i was told items have shipped but no tracking_info is available .
negative	i am very disappointed
negative	dog_food stinks ( literally ).
negative	refused to exchange and got pretty snotty .
negative	don_'_t stand by what they sell .
negative	would like to see them feed it to their dog !!!
negative	!
negative	i still_haven_'_t reviewed my items when i was told i would receive them on or before wednesday last_week ... first shopping_experience with boohoo and very disappointed
negative	i wont be speaking to any friends
negative	booked a reservation & once i received the confirmation_email i noticed that our hotel was only booked sun .- fri . instead of sat - fri . which is what our flights were booked for ..... i guess we were just supposed to sleep at the airport our first night !
negative	glad i noticed this immediately so i called and the customer_service i received was unacceptable .
negative	she kept blaming the website & wouldn_'_t stand_behind the price i was quoted even_though it was their fault with a website issue .
negative	in the end she told me i would have to pay a few_hundred more dollars because that sat .
negative	night was never charged to us again due to their fault !
negative	oh & while she was giving me the new price of our vacation package i was pricing everything online on their website & i was getting a cheaper price than she was telling_me , this being after the " glitch " was fixed with the website .
negative	then 0 days_later when i happened to be checking out the website & put in our exact vacation hotel & flight and the price came up $_000 less_than we booked it for 0 days prior !
negative	so i tried to call to see if they would adjust the price since it was so close to us booking & they refused to help me or adjust the price !
negative	just bad customer_service all around !
negative	will not be using bookit . com ever again !
negative	yesterday i made my first reservation with easytobook . com and confirmed an erroneous date .
negative	when i called the hotel there were no more rooms available for me on the correct date .
negative	i tried to call the customer_service number listed on the website and the number rang and rang without an answer .
negative	i have sent an e_- mail asking for a refund and have received no answer .
negative	i cannot say at this moment that i am a satisfied customer until i talk to someone about my concerns .
negative	i ordered a pair of heels for my sister '_s wedding i was in along with a pair of boots .
negative	i received the both pairs in on a monday ( the following saturday was the wedding ) and the heels were the wrong color .
negative	i ordered bronze , they sent black .
negative	the boots were correct .
negative	i checked my order & the shipping receipt in the box and both said bronze so this was an ami mistake .
negative	i called right_away but it took several_times to get through and finally when i did i had to wait on hold for a long time .
negative	i told the rep on the phone the problem , had to pay again for the correct shoes to be sent to me for the wedding and was told to return the incorrect heels & i would be refunded for the heels + s / h .
negative	i told her i needed the correct heels right_away and they came in on friday ( mind you the wedding was the next_day ).
negative	i returned the shoes the following_tuesday .
negative	0_weeks passed and i had not received one bit of info regarding the return .
negative	i called again ( taking several tries to get through and then on hold again for a long time ) and was told that the returns department had not received my shoes in yet & i needed to check with the shipping company used .
negative	i gave them the date & time the package arrived ( 0_weeks_ago ) and who signed for it at ami .
negative	they said nothing can be done till the shoes were checked in .
negative	i got an_email that evening saying my package had been checked in .
negative	hmmm ... coincidence ?
negative	then i was told i would get credit at ami .
negative	i called the very instant i got the message ( several tries to get through , long wait time ) and was told that i would get the refund not credit .
negative	this whole fiasco started on october_00th .
negative	this is december_00th and i still have not received a refund back .
negative	i have made numerous_calls , emails , attempts to get my refund and i keep getting the run_around .
negative	it seems you have to tell ami what to do because they have their heads up their butts and no_idea how to process a return or contact the customer .
negative	i even filed with the better business_bureau and the case was closed because ami wouldn_'_t respond or provide information .
negative	this is clearly an ami mistake and a little over 0_weeks_ago i get an_email that said that my request is with the refunds department .
negative	i hadn_'_t received a check or any info yet and sent another message to their support email checking on the status and they respond with , we don_'_t have your information and if i request a check refund it will take another 0 - 0_weeks or i could get $$ through paypal or credit with ami .
negative	i told them to stick their credit up their butt and give me a check refund .
negative	this was december_00th and i get an_email today ( 00 / 00 ) finally saying that i will get a check in 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	so , now i have to wait_until february_0000 to see if the refund shows up .
negative	so this whole_process will span up to 0 months if i get my refund in the mail as told in their email .
negative	i will never order from this company again and would highly_recommend nobody order either .
negative	if you want to go through turmoil & hair pulling then go_ahead .
negative	it is not worth it !
negative	i dont_know why its taking so long to confirm my flights .
negative	after_reading all the reviews here , i have to wonder_if i too will get screwed over by budgetair .
negative	the fact that i booked a full 00_hours ago and have not received confirmations that my tickets have been issued concerns me .
negative	with expedia , you get your tickets issued automatically .
negative	im also scared if my flights end up getting delayed or canceled that budgetair would leave me hanging with no refund and no free options .
negative	i hope for the best but lets see .
negative	this is the first time i fly 00 , 000_miles_away , i hope i dont get screwed over by this online travel_agency .
negative	i can best describe this product as a sticker .
negative	i was expecting something more substantial than a label printed for the front and rear of my daughters kindle .
negative	if the product had been cheaper i could have understood the quality but this product cost me near on £_00 and certainly does not look worth more than £ 0 .
negative	i am also being charged 00_% re - stocking_fee for returning this item , which i think is totally outrageous !
negative	this kind of policy damages smaller retailers as i will now stick to purchasing my goods from larger main street retailers in future .
negative	the radiator i ordered did not fit even after verifying vin !
negative	and since no returns i had to pay extra to have it welded .
negative	never again .
negative	went to drivetime to purchase a vehicle on 00th exspressway in oklahoma city ..... and we had to go to another lot in oklahoma city to pick_up the vehicle with the salesman ... we should '_ve known something was wrong then the vehicle was started in front of the business ....( drive time ) off s . i - 000 ...
negative	so we get in it and drive back to the other location to finish up the paper_work ...
negative	so when we get in the car to make a vehicle inspection after transferring my insurance to the newly purchased vehicle ...
negative	it wouldn_'_t start ....
negative	so then they offer me a mercedes .....
negative	it was really nice it started up ....
negative	so i decided ok i will get this car ..... had to come_back the next_day to finish the paper_work on the vehicle .... again we go out to do a vehicle inspection on the car ....
negative	when the salesman went to raise the hood a piece of the latch broke off they had to send it off to get fixed ..... that was the second strike ....
negative	spent all day up there had to come_back the next_day to finish the paperwork ....
negative	so i did took the car home ... something just didn_'_t feel right so i took the car to the mercedes dealership just to get a good look at the car ... and i spent $_000 . 00 for that .... and low and behold the mercedes had a gasket leaking oil which would '_ve cost me another $ 0000 . 00 to get fixed .... drivetime tells you you have 0 days after purchase to return the vehicle .....
negative	when i took them the report that i got from the mercedes dealership to drivetime the manager up there asked me why did i tae the car to go get looked at if i didn_'_t hear_anything wrong with the car ... and i told him .....
negative	if it was you spending $ 0000 . 00 wouldn_'_t you ....
negative	i work hard for my money ......
negative	so i too the car back because they did not offer to fix it ...
negative	they acted lie i did something wrong .... got my money back and my car because i also traded my car for this mercedes ....
negative	went to try to purchase another vehicle for another car lot and drivetime has it on my credit that i still have this car ....
negative	it shouldn_'_t even had got on there if i returned the car back within the % days ....
negative	so now this is on me credit_report for at_least 00 days ....
negative	and i called and asked why ...
negative	the manager said i don_'_t know that sounds strange to me ..... yeah it sounds strange to me too .......
negative	so i guess i will lawyer up .....
negative	i was extremely dissatisfied with your product .
negative	my printer was able to identify your ink_cartridges as not authentic hp_cartridges and would not work even_though i ordered the correct cartridges .
negative	my purchase was money down the drain .
negative	i could not return because i had already removed the tape to try to use the cartridges .
negative	you should not sell people with hp printers something that you purport to work even when the printer won_'_t even allow a scan .
negative	very disappointed and will tell other people of my story and misfortune .
negative	i will never use your service again .
negative	i was not able to cancel using the link in the email , the number listed in the email was not a working number .
negative	i tried to cancel with the hotel and was told that was not an option .
negative	the hotel gave_me an 000 number that would not cancel and gave_me another number that i was not able to navigate to reach an actual_person .
negative	this was a nightmare .
negative	i could not get my activation , no online help what a miserable experience .
negative	if it wasn_'_t the best protection i would go back to norton in a heartbeat
negative	i ordered a case of blue_buffalo cat_food .
negative	the case arrived damaged ; one can was open with dried cat_food all over the rest of the other cans .
negative	one other can was partially open ... so two cans ruined plus the rest covered in a dried mess .
negative	blue_buffalo is expensive !
negative	so i contacted customer_support and all i got was a lame $ 0 credit on my next purchase .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	i want them to at_least replace the two damaged_cans at their shipping expense ... but nope they won_'_t do that .
negative	i really don_'_t want to risk ordering more food from them after this !
negative	what was really lame was the fact that my mom booked a trip through southwest airlines and was able to change her flight plans with no fee or hassle online , i was not able to change my flight at all .
negative	lame
negative	i bought a $_000 dance pole and did not receive my item .
negative	the seller did not return any of my multiple_emails , nor did pay_pal do anything about it .
negative	i opened a dispute through pay_pal but they arent doing anything .
negative	there is nowhere to report this seller to ecrater either .
negative	it seems they do not care about their customers .
negative	i would stick to ebay because at_least you are protected .
negative	i sold two fairly old_mobiles , not to old mind only a couple of years ..
negative	i received my envelope sent them both off got a confirmation_email_saying they had received them and it wouldn_'_t be long until i get my guaranteed price !!
negative	so when i recieved an_email a few_days_later telling_me my price had been cut by £_00 because of a faulty phone i was confused .
negative	i was guaranteed the price i was offered .
negative	fair enough the phone was faulty it had a bit of water_damage i didn_'_t know about .
negative	but my whole point which i tried explaining to envirofone customer_support is that you can not go around guaranteeing prices to people when you don_'_t keep the guarantee it isn_'_t fair !!
negative	so i ended_up selling two phones for under £_00 .
negative	so i wasn_'_t the best pleased .
negative	and i have recently just found out by reading other poorly rated reviews that you are telling one customer who is complaining_about timing you say it takes 0 working days for money to go into our bank and then literally a few_days_later you are telling another customer it will be within 0 working days to go into their bank ?
negative	( there around april if you want to check ) sounds like your just saying what you want to have the last word .
negative	and if that isn_'_t enough i carried on reading found someone saying about a mark on their case after 0 years .
negative	you then responded you do not test it on marks etc .
negative	funnily enough i then carried on and another customer said the same and the only_reason she got full price was because she made a fuss .
negative	you replied that you found a 0mm hairline scratch on her case so you originally offered her less !!!
negative	are you kidding me ?
negative	have you ever heard a company contradict themselves so much .
negative	for them reasons on top of mine i '_ve changed my star from a arguably fair 0_stars to a 0_star !
negative	placed order weeks_ago and still have not received product or a return phone_call .
negative	something is seriously wrong with this company !!!!!!
negative	beware of giving them any info .
negative	i had bought a pair of glasses from global_eyeglasses a few_years_ago and it was an okay experience .
negative	then i bought another pair and the prescription was off .
negative	then i bought another pair and they took_forever to get to me .
negative	there was some kind of error and they took more than six_weeks to get to me .
negative	i will never buy from this company again .
negative	tickets purchased over a month_ago for a concert in a week and a half and still nothing .
negative	have emailed countless_times as the status of the order has not changed since the day after i bought the tickets - all i get back is an_automated reply advising that if i dont have the tickets 0 days prior to the event then i can contact the customer_services team - well this isnt good customer_service for a start - people need to take time off work , organise child care , organise transport and hotels .
negative	i read that viagogo follow_up the the sellers to progress this order - so why has this taken so long ??
negative	i know for a fact the concert issued tickets months_ago as friends who purchased these have their tickets in hand , so its hard to believe " my seller " has not yet received his or her tickets .
negative	tickets are expensive - but i dont mind paying the price if i know i '_m actually going to be attending the concert !
negative	anyone reading these reviews , thinking of placing an order - be careful and ensure if you are booking a hotel to attend a concert - make_sure its refundable .
negative	( id 0000000 )
negative	update ...... 0 days to go and still no tickets !!
negative	had an_email on the 0th_june to say they were tracking my order , but nothing since then .
negative	please let_me know where these are ?
negative	they just want to steal your money with all different excuse .
negative	i booked plane_tickets and car_rental when i want to cancel the car_rental , they
negative	told me they have to charge the cancellation_fee $_00 , i '_m ok with that ,
negative	but on top of that they said there is a service fee for the airline , come on , i '_m not cancel the airplane ticket , it says clearly on my credit_card , 0 transaction , 0 for airline , 0 for car rent .
negative	rip_off , i '_ll dispute with my credit_card company .
negative	i ordered the understanding english grammar exercises , but you sent me the textbook .
negative	pretty bad if you ask me .
negative	i had to reschedule a flight from the east_coast to portland , travelocity charged us multiple fees and issued a $_000 mco ( miscellaneous charge order ) as a credit .
negative	attempting to use the mco has_been a nightmare .
negative	i followed the directions on the letter and sent the mco coupon to them ( after calling travelocity for an address , as there '_s no address on the letter ).
negative	i mailed it on thursday - certified / overnight mail .
negative	travelocity called me saturday_morning and left a message that they had received the mco and that we had 0 days to book the flight or they would send it back and charge our credit_card $_00 . 00 .
negative	i called saturday_afternoon and after getting transferred around , disconnected , on hold forever - i spent over 0 hours + on hold and trying to get some assistance with the reservation - just to be told that the mco department was only open monday - friday and the reissue department couldn_'_t verify that they ' d received the mco so they wanted me to call back on monday .
negative	rediculous .
negative	i ordered 0 items , received 0 .
negative	money back after 0 months .
negative	and it wasn_'_t the first time .
negative	maybe they sell things that they don_'_t have .
negative	i have just purchased the hotel room 00_minutes ago from the bookit . com .
negative	after i paid it , i realized that this hotel is located in the sunset beach which is far from the myrtle_beach .
negative	i didn_'_t know about this because this website doesn_'_t mention about any other information of the hotel before paying it .
negative	i tried to cancel this purchase but they request to charge cancellation_fee , so i tried to explain about this situation to customer_service in order to wave the cancellation_fee .
negative	technically , this is not my fault because i typed myrtle_beach , sc in the destination site to seek for hotels at myrtle_beach but sunset beach hotel was pop_up among the hotels at the myrtle_beach .
negative	anyway , i explained about this to customer_service but customer care woman_who is [_name ] is very rude .
negative	she humiliates me .
negative	her attitude is bad without kindness .
negative	customer_service is supposed to help customer and provide assistance with customers for their satisfactions .
negative	however , she kept reading company '_s policy whatever i feel unfair and misunderstanding .
negative	i have been using this website but i am not gonna use this website anymore .
negative	[_external reference_] and [_external reference_] never charge cancellation_fee especially if customers want to cancel their transaction within 00_minutes .
negative	however , i have to pay $_00 . 00 cancellation_fee .
negative	it was very unacceptable experience for me .
negative	where i live is apparently a problem for fedex .
negative	the rural road does not show up on a gps , altho ups has no problem .
negative	my order was supposed to be delivered on the 00th and i didn_'_t get it until the 00th .
negative	i will give credit of 0 day due to a road closure for repair but an_alternate route could have been used .
negative	i now know to make_sure i give more than a week notice for ordering , if i order again .
negative	i talked to a woman at petflow and a rurally said i don_'_t feel_like i should pay for shipping since it was 0 days late and all she said was thank_you for shopping with petflow .
negative	i still feel_like they should take my shipping_charges off as my babies did run_out of food and won_'_t eat anything_else , so went hungry for 0 day .... never should have happened .
negative	they need to check into other shipping arrangements .
negative	i actually asked to have it shipped ups and was told they don_'_t use ups .
negative	i was also not given to a supervisor when i asked to be transferred to one .
negative	this is not my first order and have had shipping problems before
negative	thank_you

negative	i purchased 0 han solo blasters for my sons halloween_costumes .
negative	both arrived broken , one of them had a battery compartment completely installed backwards .
negative	i called to replace them .
negative	it cost over $ 0 to return them and they charged me another $ 0 to ship the new ones , even_though they sent me defective merchandise .
negative	in addition , when i called the company i asked for the customer_service manager .
negative	it turns_out the woman_who identified herself as " roxanne " on the phone is also the manager since she works out of her home and sells her products out of her garage .
negative	in spite of the fact that she is " in charge " she refused to ship the replacement products for free ( in spite of the fact that she sent me broken items ).
negative	i would never order from this company , it is a scam !!!
negative	!
negative	getting the run_around on where the package even is .
negative	they want feedback on something i haven_'_t received .
negative	which is annoying .
negative	i am usually very happy when i book a room in advance , but not this time .
negative	booking it was easy .
negative	when i got to the hotel the lady at the desk told me that my card was declined and i needed to pay .
negative	i received an_email_confirmation amd even had easy access to my online bank_statement where my money had been taken out .
negative	the lady gets on the phone and this takes 00_min for her to figure_out that it was their mistake and not mine .
negative	in the mean time , my sister in law last_minute had to book a room so she waited on me so we could be close .
negative	the lady told me i got a better rate since i booked in advance .
negative	i asked my sister in law how much her room cost and hers was $_00 cheaper and included breakfast !!!
negative	they gave_us a map of where our rooms were but it was still like a maze .
negative	it was not easy to find even w the map .
negative	i will not be returning to that hotel and i i will dang sure be checking the hotels rates by calling them comparing their prices w travelocitys .
negative	i have never had to pay $_00 more for the same room .
negative	this website does not give enough info to order the correct_part and then wants to charge me 00_% restocking_fee and i have to pay for shipping to return the part .
negative	i went to amazon and found the right part and it was cheaper since they do not charge for shipping .
negative	they need to update their servers so that it makes sure the part fits and is what you want before they sell it to you .
negative	they could use amazons website as an example .
negative	sucks when they cancel your order for no reason when you were depending_on it ........
negative	why did you cancel my lowes giftcard order ?
negative	i was counting on using them today .. no fair !

negative	i do not like going through reservation sites to make my hotel reservations .
negative	why ?
negative	because of all of your rules and restrictions .
negative	i am a business traveler and stay 00 - 00 nights every_month and occasionally have to change my plans .
negative	when i work directly with the hotel they are very accomodating and do not charge me change fees , etc .
negative	when i go through sites like yours , i '_m sol if i need to make a change .
negative	what really ticks me off is how deceptive your online site is .
negative	it looks like i '_m booking directly with the hotel because of the way your online address appears on the site , but it '_s all just smoke and mirrors .
negative	so your deceptive appearance completely destroys your creditibility and integrity .
negative	i just need to be more aware when i '_m making my reservations so i '_m not hoodwinked by your misleading and deceptive practices .
negative	i have also found that the online sites do not have better prices than going directly through the hotel so my question is , why go through sites likes yours , especially when you are so damn inflexible ?
negative	ugghhh !
negative	had vanuit nl via internet bij regiobloemist . be een boeket bloemen besteld voor_mijn grootmoeder in belgie .
negative	vind ten ten eerste de keuze erg weinig , en ten tweede zijn de prijzen superhoog .
negative	ik moest 00_euro betalen voor_een boeketje tulpen .
negative	terwijl ik voor datzelfde boeket hier in nl max .
negative	een tientje betaal .
negative	en dan waren ze ook_nog es na drie dagen verwelkt .
negative	schandalig gewoon .
negative	en_ook_nog es 00_euro durven vragen voor servicekosten ????
negative	terwijl mijn oma amper 0kmtje van die bloemist vandaan woont .
negative	bookit is giving me the runaround about my trip .
negative	i '_m trying to book my infant a seat on the flight and they keep passing the buck .
negative	i '_m very disappointed with them .
negative	very bad company , i had 0 damaged window visor .
negative	almost one month_ago .
negative	all they do is ask me to send photo '_s repeatedly .
negative	they fail to answer any questions .
negative	i am stuck with a broken part and no refund .
negative	i am now joining others in class action law suit .
negative	do not do_business with this company .
negative	meine_mutter hat die_blumen erst gegen 0 uhr abends bekommen .
negative	die_blumen haben sehr schlimm gestunken , so sehr , dass meine_mutter die_blumen auf_den balkon stellen musste und konnte sie nicht im haus bewundern ,.
negative	wir waren sehr enttaeuscht .
negative	my order was cancelled
negative	seriously , i answered all of your security questions …. and it still is not good enough ?
negative	i am hearing impaired and you want me to call ?
negative	disgusting …. i will take my money elsewhere .
negative	i booked a hotel in an unpopulated suberb .
negative	our event was canceled suddenly at 0pm on the day of check in .
negative	i immediately tried to cancel the hotel .
negative	it was only then that i realized that my credit_card had already been charge the full_amount .
negative	and the customer_service people laughed at me when i asked for a refund !
negative	they kept saying this is what i agreed too ....... no it isn_'_t what i agreed too .
negative	will never do_business with these people again .
negative	i specifically told the guy that i only wanted to book one night and that i could not afford two_nights and that i didn_'_t want to book at all if i had to buy 0 nights .
negative	he tricked me into reserving 0 nights and ran my card and everything ...
negative	he told me i could cancel the second night in the future .
negative	...
negative	i still have to pay upfront both nights dude !!
negative	$_000 that i did not have on my card and now i will likely overdraft !!
negative	he transferred me to another person to cancel and that person said they had no records of my booking .
negative	it took calling the actual hotel and calling reservation_counter back and being transferred several_times to get the cancellation .
negative	i am so incredibly frustrated and will never use reservation_counter or any other third_party again !!
negative	!
negative	the costume i ordered looked very nice on - line but when i received it - it was not the same as in the picture .
negative	the colors were not even close to the same ... the fit was poor .
negative	the material was cheap and the design was poor .
negative	the closures in the back were so poorly designed that the costume just hung on your frame and kept falling_off my shoulders .
negative	i am sending it back .
negative	i hope i don_'_t have any_problems with the company in returning it !
negative	i was told that i will receive the card before christmas and days latter i was told it will come until after christmas not acceptable !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a part , was sent the wrong one .
negative	no one will pick_up the phone .
negative	it states to not return an item without an_rma_number well where the hell can i get that ?
negative	if no one answers the phone , or responds to customer_service requests !!!!
negative	waited to gather the money for the part , just to get stuck in this mess !!!
negative	will never ever order from them again !!!!!
negative	now stuck with a part that doesn_'_t work , $_000_dollars down the drain ....
negative	this site is great to look at but don_'_t try to buy anything other then accessories there because they will screw up and then will not correct there mistakes wasted time and patience hated it
negative	i ordered medication and advised i wanted the 0 day shipping at the higher_rate .
negative	i contacted my vet to let them know of the upcoming prescription .
negative	the saturday after the order was placed i asked my vet if they had received a prescription for my dog ( three_days after i had placed the order ) and was told there was no prescription faxed to them .
negative	had to wait_until monday to be able to contact a person at vetrx .
negative	the rep said that they had faxed the prescription to my vet and then did so again the next_day without_any response .
negative	i was upset since i had already been told no prescription was received and the vet had been receiving faxes with no problem .
negative	i asked the cs_rep why they did not contact the vet by some other means ( like a phone_call ) since i had paid_extra to get the rx faster .
negative	they said they would try and contact vet to find out what was going wrong after they faxed again a third time .. needless to say my prescription was not received until a week_later and i was charged the extra 00 . 00 to get it in two_days .
negative	good customer_service i would think is that if there was no response or the company doesn_'_t get a confirmation that the fax was received would be to contact the dr . directly to fast track the rx ... but no such thing occurred .
negative	i will not be ordering meds from this company anymore , their prices may be good but i have used another pet rx company in the past and when i do the 0 day shipping i receive it in two_days .
negative	the prescription i ordered from vet_rx twice - both delayed and took longer to get to my door .
negative	they can make the sale due to prices but you need to make_sure to contact both the vet and the rx company to make_sure your order is being placed - too much to do in other areas in life to babysit a online rx company to make_sure my dog gets her meds .
negative	ordered a nice watch but it doesn_'_t work .... real disappointed for the price was nice but it is junk you get what you pay for i guess ....
negative	i bought my cat hypoallergenic canned_cat_food since the vet says he has irritable bowel syndrome and has lost more than 00_% of his weight .
negative	so we are desperate and i thought we would try this food at more than $ 0 a can .
negative	website good .
negative	arrived quickly .
negative	box in perfect_shape and packed with air_bubbles .
negative	yet 0 cans were dented and leaked food over some more cans .
negative	must have left company in bad shape .
negative	where is your quality control ?
negative	i was hoping to form a long_term relationship and never have to shop for bulky cat items again .
negative	i am a working mom with 0 small kids and 0 cats and have trouble fitting cat stuff in my cart and be able to push the weight .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	:(
negative	the email_confirmation date is different then one i booked .
negative	i tried to change it and was told there is a fee of $_000_per_ticket .
negative	this is less_than 00_hours after i booked .
negative	my husband is under several doctors care and i would not have made that date - he simple can '_t travel then ?
negative	i am disputing the charges with the credit_card company since they will not help me .
negative	the workers were very nice very helpful i found a sofa and love seat i wanted and also bought some end tables and kitchen table .
negative	i was told that i can get same day delivery which i said ok but i wanted a brand_new couch not the floor set the worker told me he had one in the back .
negative	as they delivered the couch set i noticed rips and marks and scratches and told the delivery people they told me to call american_freight .
negative	i went the next_day and noticed the floor set was gone so they basically lied to me and sold me the set damaged at full price .
negative	i now have to wait 0 - 0_weeks for a brand_new set and i '_m very upset to even use the furniture they gave_me till the replacement comes .
negative	who_wants furniture that everybody has sat on tried and tested it .
negative	not me !
negative	i will never shop_here again .
negative	instead of telling_me it wasn_'_t in stock ( which i would of gladly waited for it ) they lied just to make a sale to reach their numbers for the day !
negative	i was looking for a clutch_kit .
negative	i clicked on clutch_kit and ordered .
negative	however , i received only the pressure plate .
negative	i contacted customer_service who said the additional kit was 000_dollars more .
negative	i already spent 00 .
negative	yet their other clutch kits were under a 000 .
negative	deceptive marketing .
negative	will never use them again .
negative	i went to the government site to sign_up for health_care , did the application and was told what the tax credit would be .
negative	i chose to go through e_- health , thinking i was following directions to get the best price including the tax credits .
negative	instead , i signed_up , got the insurance , then found out the next_day that the tax credits do not apply by going through e_- health .
negative	typical of what i '_ve grown to reluctantly accept in dealing_with insurance companies and now there is a new layer of deceipt by having on - line sales groups who are just being given commissions for catching unsuspecting traffic .
negative	i was very upset after flying from knoxville , tn to daytona beach to be informed the two bedroom_condo with in room jacuzzi tub that i had booked had been given to someone_else .
negative	i was told by email at 0 pm .
negative	the agent at book it told me she had arranged a one bedroom at wyndham .
negative	when arriving at wyndham it took the agent an_hour to check us in .
negative	then at 00_pm when arriving at our room our key didn_'_t work .
negative	next the room was 00_degrees and they sent a technician to fix that .
negative	this is not what i had in mind when i booked an ocean front two bedroom_condo at the beach .
negative	love the shoes i got
negative	except for the holes , not being true to size , sequins falling_off , and a whole heel being on a slant ..
negative	will never buy from this site again .
negative	the person with whom i was connected barely spoke_english i had to repeat numbers to him multiple_times and then didn_'_t send me my confirmation .... cancelling was almost as bad but at_least i got my confirmation ... i will never book with them again .
negative	couldnt wait any longer so advised welford rd customer_services that i wanted to cancel .
negative	didnt feel igot a good response and now i have to go into the store to get my refund ... surely you are able to do refunds over the phone !
negative	!
negative	paid 0 times the face value of the ticket .
negative	tickets available near the date in viagogo at a reasonable price .
negative	despicable .
negative	within one order the toilet system was sent with the flush piece which didn_'_t fit the hole and likewise with the sink , we have now found that the waste unit is not compatible with the unit either .
negative	both items we brought on the recommendation of the ' essential extras ' that you are advised to buy !
negative	i am gutted as just spent a lot more money with them on main bathroom , wish i had spent it elsewhere where the customer_service in product knowledge is better .
negative	i suppose that '_s what you get with cheap !
negative	i ordered vanities months_ago , and was sent incomplete products , damaged products , and the wrong products , again and again .
negative	several_months later and i am left with items i did not order and poor customer_service to correct the issue .
negative	i still have not received the correct items or an undamaged product .
negative	very disappointed in this company '_s lack of response , and i am out a lot of cash left with crap !!
negative	!
negative	still_waiting on my items / refund that i ordered last month and paid next_day delivery for !
negative	not happy !
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	when needing to made a change to my flights , i spent over an_hour with a rude , ill informed travelocity customer_support rep getting the runaround and ultimately having them tell me they couldn_'_t access my record anyway .
negative	and with their call_center in india the rep was very difficult to understand .
negative	after wasting all this time they then just transferred me directly to the airline .
negative	it was a fiasco .
negative	at_least i learned how wonderful jet_blue is , how helpful and friendly there call_center staff are and that based in salt_lake city there staff speak_english !
negative	will never ever bookk through_travelocity .
negative	it is just a horrendous mess if you need to speak with a live_person
negative	i ordered a sofa what i was really excited about , got an order confirmation and then waited for delivery , longer_than they indicated , and finally called them to find out what was going on .
negative	the woman on the phone acted strange , like she knew something she wasn_'_t allow to tell .
negative	she said nothing about the company not having contacted me about the delay in shipping .
negative	i felt as if i had entered a private conversation that wasn_'_t any of my business .
negative	she told me , with no care or transparency , that she would have to call me back .
negative	when she did , she said that , because of the storm sandy , the manufacturer '_s inventory was ruined and that i wouldn_'_t be able to get this sofa .
negative	i feel horrible for the victims of sandy -- it was a tragic thing that happened -- but the tone of the woman_who spoke to me was equally horrible .
negative	she had no care or concern , no interest in offering me another option .
negative	she was cold as ice .
negative	i kept thinking while she was speak to me what the owner of the company would be thinking if he had heard how she was with me .
negative	she wouldn_'_t have had her job another day .
negative	at_least , that '_s how i would have reacted .
negative	and this poor customer_service , this completely insensitive treatment just goes on and on .
negative	i will never visit futonland '_s website again .
negative	my credit_card was charged for a shoe i ordered and after 0_weeks , i got a email_saying i was refunded because the manufacturer couldn_'_t do my shoe :(
negative	i bought a pc from ginger0 nine months_ago .
negative	it was advertised as an ' extreme games pc ' , however whenever you played a game it crashed after around 0 - 00_mins .
negative	i immediately sent a return request as the pc as it came with a years warranty .
negative	it took 0_weeks for them to collect it and they then had the pc for 0_weeks , after many phonecalls they eventually said they had fixed it saying they had changed the graphics cards and there was a £_00_pound charge .
negative	i payed happy that they had found the problem .
negative	but on its return it was exactly the same .
negative	i contacted ginger0 again and asked for a refund as it was not fit for purpose .
negative	they refused to give a refund and only said they would repair the pc .
negative	reluctantly i returned it again , this time it was swiftly collected but again they held onto they pc for around 0_weeks .
negative	they contacted me saying it was the power_supply , again there was going to be a charge , which i obviously refused to pay and the eventually returned it .
negative	the damn thing wasn_'_t fixed at all though , and i was infuriated .
negative	i contacted ginger0 asking for a refund again but was denied .
negative	i sent a letter to the managing_director again asking for a refund and enclosing the sale of goods act .
negative	no response .
negative	this purchase from ginger0 has proved to be the most frustrating and unpleasant experience dragging out for months and causing lots of stress and dissapointment as it was a large sum to right off just over_£_000 .
negative	i gave up with ginger0 and would never use them again , and would recommend all to steer_clear of this company .
negative	cougar extreme of nottingham diagnosed the faulty processor in 0 days and at last it was reapired at a cost of £_000
negative	devastated .
negative	beware
negative	i live in jersey , channel_islands , gb & was about to place an order for oska clothing until i confirmed that p_& p would cost £_00 (£ 00 to guernsey !)
negative	and they don_'_t even take the vat off !
negative	!
negative	postage is no no more to jersey than it is to london .
negative	i swiftly cancelled the order .
negative	customer_services lady confirmed this was the case .
negative	channel island residents beware !
negative	beware , they can cancel orders at will and leave you in the dark .
negative	i placed some orders with an advertised coupon and kept getting cancelled .
negative	they gave excuses of invalid phone_number but i suspect the real reason was because prices were too low after coupon .
negative	and since when do merchants have to call customers in order to process an order with credit_card ?
negative	i had to email to find out status of my orders only to meet awful customer_service which doesn_'_t show any interest in getting your orders .
negative	they lied about emailing me asking for permission to cancel and insinuate me of credit_card fraud .
negative	their mall store is just as bad , making me fight for a legit return with receipt that was bought 0 mins prior .
negative	i will never buy or recommend anyone of perfume emporium .
negative	i ordered a gift_card for grandson '_s birthday on nov . 00 .
negative	it is now december 00 and it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i have talked to company twice and was assured it would be here by the 00th .
negative	if not here in mail december 00 will be calling my credit_card company .
negative	will not do this again
negative	i ordered this phone nearly a month_ago and as i was having issues with my bank_account my husband ordered one as well in case my bank_account didn_'_t allow the purchase as we could always send one back .
negative	i needed the phone immediately as mine wasn_'_t working so i selected the ups_ground and ups 0 day for the other one .
negative	after a couple days i called and asked why i hadn_'_t recieved one of my phones yet and why i hadn_'_t been provided with a tracking_number .
negative	i was then told that it had shipped and i should see it in 0 to 0 days .
negative	needless to say that didn_'_t happen .
negative	then i was told that there was only one tracking_number .
negative	i didn_'_t think it was possible but was told that yes in fact they were shipped together even_though i had been told two_days prior that my order had already shipped though my husbands hadn_'_t .
negative	how does that work ?
negative	to cut the story short we were told we would be refunded our shipping money and still_haven_'_t seen a dime .
negative	i got one phone a month later , and now am apparently supposed to be getting another one soon .
negative	ya right !
negative	anyways please don_'_t waste your time with this place !!!
negative	it '_s a horrible company that will take your time , money and will ruin your whole day !
negative	please stay away from it !!
negative	!
negative	there was an_error made regarding the date of my departure and i was still charged 00 . 00 , even_though i did not make the mistake .
negative	i was penalized for someone_else '_s mistake .
negative	you sent broken stuff and replaced it with broken stuff ... if the stuff is broken throw it away don_'_t steal my money and send it to me to throw_away
negative	i used them to refer me to a close hotel they lied to me about the distance and when i called back after i booked no one wanted to help me and they accused me of lying and offered me $_00 off my next book never ever booking with them again !
negative	!
negative	i purchased a game which failed to download the first six times i tried .
negative	once the file was on my computer , it failed to open .
negative	i used all of their online customer_support suggestions and after literal hours and hours of trying , it still is reading as an_error_message .
negative	i '_m very familiar with computers and know that my computer is compatible with the software .
negative	i contacted the company , to no_avail .
negative	i also researched a phone_number ( which was extremely hard to comeby ) and left a message , also to no_avail .
negative	i stated that i either wanted help or a refund ( either would be acceptable , preferably a refund at this point ).
negative	i am beyond disappointed and plan on contacting bbb as soon as i can .
negative	i find it highly unacceptable to have such a low level of service .
negative	i consider it fraud and plan on taking full action .
negative	i do not suggest using them to anyone .
negative	i was very disappointed upon_opening my package from petflow . com .
negative	my 00_lb_bag of cat_food was busted wide open within the box and there was cat_food in e v e r y t h i n g !
negative	they also screwed_up my order of bully_sticks .
negative	overall , very dissatisfied .
negative	i don_'_t recommend at all .
negative	i can get better prices from other website and better service .
negative	all seemed ok at first .
negative	envelope arrived quickly .
negative	after sending phones off , cheque took over a week to arrive .
negative	when it did it was made payable to a samsung phone and not me !!
negative	when i called to complain the adviser said i would have to wait another seven working days for another cheque , unacceptable as it was envirofones error .
negative	i '_m not happy and will never use this company again .
negative	why do you offer it on the website then ?
negative	i bet i won_'_t get a response .....
negative	i will never book on line again .
negative	i was told three_times after three specific questions , " are you positive my card won_'_t be charged until check in ".
negative	answer , oh absolutely not , it will be charged at the time of your check in .
negative	turns_out they were processing the full_amount as we spoke !
negative	now i have to wait five to six business days for it to show in my account !
negative	i have opened a fraud investigation at our bank against them ... this is legalized robbery and consumers should have more control than we do .
negative	so i will exercise the only control i have ... i will never use this service or one like them again !
negative	i hope they are put out of business .
negative	never use these people .
negative	their customer_service is horrible .
negative	they started working
negative	feb . 00 , 0000 .
negative	it is now mar .
negative	00 , 0000 and i still have squirrels .
negative	can '_t get a scheduled
negative	appointment .
negative	you don_'_t want to deal with these people .
negative	they got their money , that '_s all they care about .
negative	i made reservations at a hotel three_months ahead and three_weeks before my trip i need to make it a two night instead of three_nights .
negative	called and they left my on hold twice for 00_mins until i hung_up .
negative	after calling again three more times and getting put on hold again for 00_mins again i hung_up .
negative	finally i just asked the person to please help me and all they could do is redo my whole reservations and charge me the going rate for that day ..... unbelievable that all that needed to be done was make it a two night instead of three .
negative	lost my great deal and two buffets and i had no other choice hate them they can '_t even speak_english ...
negative	awful service , poor customer_service .
negative	deeply dissatisfied .
negative	felt_like i was being scammed and apparently the credit manager thought i wouldn_'_t catch the scam .
negative	i am a law enforcement officer and worked in a law office for 00 years , so i know a scam when i see one !
negative	the rate offered for the hotel i booked was reasonable but the space where you fill in the " promo_code " was hidden on the side in faint green type and when i clicked on the " continue " i assumed it would ask for a " code " at that point and i would be able to redeem the discount .
negative	unfortunately , it just went_ahead and charged my credit_card without giving me that option .
negative	i called to try to add the discount to my reservation and was offered no help whatsoever ... even by the supervisor who would not give me the time of day .
negative	this is a shady business .
negative	i do not recommend it and i will never book a trip through this website again !
negative	take me off your email list .
negative	when i called to get some information , the customer_service rep was very rude and unhelpful .
negative	i inquired_about a flight to newark and he quoted me $_000 .
negative	i told him repeatedly that i was unable to see the same flights on my computer and when i asked him if he could tell me the flights that were departing in the morning after 0 : 00 am , he rudely told me that there was too many and that i would need to look at them online .
negative	i kept telling him that i was not seeing any flights at $_000 , the only_thing he kept saying is to refresh the screen .
negative	he finally told me that he could not help me .
negative	their website is misleading .
negative	i was mislead into accepting a counter offer , which was not good at all .
negative	a lot of hotel chain have their own website , you can get discount , points for future stay and know exactly which hotel before you book and you avoid the risk of getting a queen rather_than two double_bed .
negative	being a family of 0 - 0 , i will book from hotel '_s own website
negative	hi -
negative	i have to say that while the website was great to use aunt jean called today from wales to say she got 0 flowers and a spring of pine - and it was a ripoff - so please don_'_t send any more .
negative	not sure what to say to that , but thought i should pass the message along .
negative	i wasted way toooo much time trying to order from here .
negative	i was sent a refer a friend coupon for $_00 off any order , then also given a free_shipping code on facebook .
negative	i tried to order online and it kept saying the $_00 was applied to my order but it never took it off .
negative	i called thinking maybe i could not use both coupons .
negative	they said i could so i gave all my order info and payment info and then , after they wasted more of my time said i had to have a $_00 order to use the $_00 even_though the email did not say that .
negative	i told them to cancel my order and have a manager call me .
negative	a manager never contacted me .
negative	now i am being asked how i like the specific things i ordered .
negative	i have not gotten anything .
negative	they are very confused .
negative	they need better communication and better training of their employees .
negative	i bought food on the 00th and they promised me delivery on the 0st of march , that didn_'_t happen , it came late on the 0th of march , organix was on sale so i bought 0 bags and then they triple charged me for the purchase .
negative	customer servixe dahnel was rude and didn_'_t apoligize for their mistake , and told me to return it .
negative	now i no_longer trust internet shopping .
negative	i will not be using your website again .
negative	many mistakes along the way .
negative	people were double_charged , credits were given to the wrong people and customer_service would not do anything to take_care of it and make costumer happy .

negative	i ordered this for next_day delivery - it took 0 days to arrive !
negative	when i emailed to complain i was told that all the details were clearly shown on their website i . e .
negative	what days over christmas they were open - i did '_t see it anywhere and checked several_times .
negative	they didn_'_t answer my questions and got told that they didn_'_t see this ' going anywhere '.
negative	really appaling service , i would not recommend !
negative	i bought a cricket ball for my nephew '_s birthday and was really disappointed when it arrived .
negative	firstly , it shouldn_'_t have been delivered to my house as i asked for it to get sent straight to my nephew '_s address so it would arrive in time for his_birthday .
negative	secondly , the product looked nothing like the photo - a poor quality , cheap looking ball arrived in nasty plastic packaging , that i would feel embarrassed to give .
negative	thirdly , the team i dealt_with at millet_sports were unhelpful and unconstructive in resolving my issue .
negative	i initially asked for the p_& p back as it was sent to an incorrect_address .
negative	when millet repeatedly ignored this request , i was successful in getting a full_refund for the item ( as well as p_& p ) through ebay .
negative	they thought by just ignoring me i would go away - wrong !
negative	avoid using millet_sports !
negative	!
negative	i could have gotten the same product at the same price elsewhere the delivery is soooo slow .
negative	the reason i purchased through you was i had a $ 0 voucher to use .
negative	other web ( vitacost . com ) shipped the next_day and arrived a day later .
negative	i was pleased with my order and the delivery , i am not pleased that my debit_card number is now compromised and someone_else is using it to order more parts .
negative	beware !
negative	i was very disappointed with bookbyte .
negative	i have tried many other rental sites for textbooks and this one was by_far the worst .
negative	first of all i was taking a month long summer class , and well i wanted to pay the lowest cost for my book .
negative	i thought i could get away with just renting for 00days but then i started to worry maybe that wouldn_'_t be long enough .
negative	in my gut i knew i couldn_'_t get away with only renting for 00days , so i decided on the 00 day rental , just to be safe .
negative	i am more than happy with my decision to get the extended rental , as it took nearly two_weeks just to ship , and get to me .
negative	and while the book was being shipped the 00 rental days started to dwindle .
negative	by the time i received the book i had about 00 days of my course left and 00 days of my rental left .
negative	i am disappointed as i ordered the book before my class started , and received it halfway_through .
negative	i have returned the book and i am a little_nervous that since they started the rental day when they shipped the book , that they will not have counted to book as returned until they get it .
negative	this company was unreliable and just_plain slow .
negative	i will never rent a book from this site again , and will warn my friends about renting from this site .
negative	worst service ever , took money out of my bank_account immediately .
negative	it has_been 0 days and my order was never processed and no one got back to me .
negative	had a customer_service rep email me with the wrong info , and then they never got back to me when i emailed them again .
negative	ordered prda glasses .
negative	they came in completley unadjusted and i don_'_t_believe they would have fit anyone .
negative	i returned them and eventually received a partial_refund .
negative	i have since sent three email requests asking why i did not receive a full_refund and have received absolutely no response in 0_weeks .
negative	i will never order from this company again .
negative	i was horrified when i opened box to discover the wc unit i bought was damaged in 0 places . in my mind it had been thrown about .
negative	i had no choice but to use cabinet as customer couldn_'_t wait for replacment very disappointed . plus i will put pictures of damage on their website
negative	will not use these people again
negative	well i can_honestly say the attendant was eager help .
negative	although difficult to understand , there was defiantly a language_barrier that was very problematic .
negative	i thought i was speaking directly to a mariott reservationist which he did not make clear .
negative	when i asked about using my points his response was ," i don_'_t have access to that information ".
negative	we continued and the reservation was made for two rooms .
negative	after we hung_up and i looked at the email_confirmations , i saw he had made the reservation for the wrong dates .
negative	when i called the number on my mariotts rewards card , it all became clear i had spoken to a third_party vendor to make my reservations .
negative	i subsequently cancelled the wrong reservations and now notice two $ 0 . 00 cancelation fees .
negative	i am very disappointed that you didn_'_t try to find out why your product did ' nt fit electrically . was it the wrong model number ?
negative	was my 00 still using a different years part ?, maybe a 00 '_s .
negative	i '_m without the part and $_00 . 00 return fees .
negative	i bought vouchers and pcsupply refuse to exchange my vouchers for a nonrestricted vouchers they are rude and have poor poor lousy costumer support i have been buying vouchers for months and they treated me like crap they did not want to help me out in anyway .
negative	they are a total ripoff beware
negative	i have definitely learned my lesson i will not and i would not ever purchase anything from american_freight furniture .
negative	i found out that if american_freight offers any deals or special rates don_'_t bother wasting your time and money with this company because you can pay them all the money get what you purchased two or three_months down the line .
negative	mind you they never once tell you their furniture takes so long to be ordered or delivered .
negative	they are { very quick } to take your money , but to bring your furniture to you they are as slow as molasses .
negative	unapologetic their customer_service suck big time .
negative	the furniture that i bought was not what i ordered but , because it took months just to get it i didn_'_t even_bother calling to dispute it .
negative	i just know that my hard_earned money will go to a company that cares_about the interest of their customers .
negative	i will never go cheap again !!
negative	rooms to go here i come .
negative	terrible service and terrible product .
negative	i ordered yesterday for a balloon bouquet to be delivered for today - my granddaughter '_s third birthday .
negative	i was on the phone with them three_times before they finally delivered .
negative	they didn_'_t have anything right but did finally deliver a half_hour past the deadline .
negative	she was supposed to have three mylar balloons and six regular balloons in various colors .
negative	what she received was two second rate mylars and three regular - two red and a pink .
negative	very unattractive and not nearly what i ordered .
negative	when i called to complain i waited for ten_minutes and then was cut_off with a bogus busy message .
negative	email : nanone0 @ msn . com
negative	park n ' fly may be more_expensive but the do the job right .
negative	i had a trip planned , but could not go because i was ill . travelocity would not reimburse_me for my trip .
negative	i called the hotel and learned that i should have just dealt_with them directly instead of going through a third - party like travelocity .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	the hotel would not have charged me for cancelling .
negative	i was guaranteed of my flights and an_hour before the first flight was to take off i get a email from you stating the flight was delayed for 0 0 / 0 hour .
negative	i got to the airport 00_minutes early and no one was at the ticket counter .
negative	after a few_minutes a guy showed_up , took a few_minutes to log in the computer and then stated i could get a boarding_pass but i could not take a bag .
negative	i told him i had no carry - on that everything was in that bag .
negative	i told him i couldn_'_t go with out my bag and he walked away thru a door .
negative	i called my husband freaking and then called american airline and as i was on the line with them the man returned and said he got me on .
negative	i literally had to run thru the airport , but i got on .
negative	i had 00 minute lay over in chicago , we landed on time but then took 00_minutes to taxi to the gate .
negative	i had to get a boarding_pass in chicago so i run to get it , they give it to me , i went to the restroom and came back and i looked at the sign near the gate and it said boarding and then departing .
negative	i go up to the counter to see what is going on ( with 0 others that just arrived ) and they went to see if we could get on , as we were waiting we watch the airplane leave .
negative	when i was given the boarding_pass they never told me they were boarding then .
negative	so i had a wait 0 0 / 0 hours for another .
negative	i finally get to my final_destination and ask about my bag and was told that it would be locked in a secure place and to check with security .
negative	i went to baggage_claim and see my bag just sitting there with no one around .
negative	had it not been that i was going to a funeral i would have cancelled when you first changed the flight .
negative	i will only book thru an airline in the future .... not with you or american airline .
negative	so i booked two tickets to key_west for a wedding from cheapoair thinking i received a great deal .
negative	i did pay $_000 r / t which was pretty_decent .
negative	so the night before i printed my itinerary and was ready to go !
negative	next_day headed to airport to find an empty line .
negative	i knew something was wrong .
negative	apparently our flight had been cancelled a month_ago and the flight we were supposed to take left already .
negative	annoyed ... i called cheapoair customer_service only to end up waiting 00_minutes to speak to a person_who barely spoke_english and did not want to take_responsibility .
negative	between the airline and cheapoair , they both were pointing fingers at each other .
negative	my itinerary never changed or was updated from cheapoair and i was forced to leave the next_day missing out on time and money spent down in florida !
negative	and then on the way home we weren_'_t even guaranteed seats !!!
negative	it was so pathetic i ' d_rather pay the extra $_00 for some decent customer_service and a guaranteed flight .
negative	well they promise next_day delivery .
negative	0_weeks_later and im still_waiting for my parcel to be deliveried !!
negative	they dont tell me there is a delay until i chase it with them and then they just say they are doing everything they can to get it moving but dont explain_why it is delayed and give no follow_up help .
negative	bit of a nightmare from the start .
negative	the website states the delivery times but these are totally fictitious .
negative	i ordered samples of the material to check the colour first .
negative	after 0 month they hadn_'_t arrived , i emailed , the site says they will reply to emails in 00_hours , i waited weeks !
negative	they eventually got to me after 0 months .
negative	i then ordered the dresses and got an_email_saying that they saw i had ordered fabric samples and that before they would send the dresses i had to acknowledge that the colours may not be the same as the samples i paid for !
negative	!
negative	one dress was custom made , they emailed me to remeasure hollow to floor , we did and increased the size .
negative	when it arrived they sent the original size , not the increased one we had agreed on email .
negative	after about 0_weeks i emailed and said that i needed them for my wedding in april .
negative	they said they would get them there .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	they arrived 00th_april , i got married the week before so had a rediculous rush to find new dresses .
negative	:-( they arrived with a customs charge of £_00 .
negative	the dresses were of a decent quality , the neckline was not exactly the same as on the picture on the site .
negative	i know from my previous experience of trying to communicate with didobridal that complaining will get me nowhere so i am chopping it up to experience .
negative	placed an order online in early dec with expedited_shipping for christmas .
negative	no show on 00 / 00 so i called customer_service - no one available ... left a message - no return call .
negative	called 00 / 00 - same , no return call .
negative	called 00 / 00 and 00 / 00 - same .
negative	sent emails and no reply until i cancelled my order .
negative	why is it only after i cancel someone responds .
negative	run , don_'_t buy .
negative	on booking with these people we took out the insurance then when we took back the car the rental place charged us again
negative	on returning we were told nothing could be done its in the fine_print
negative	why cant the 0 companies talk ie tell avis we had already paid
negative	will not use again
negative	seriously will never ever use this company again !
negative	they ripped me off about $_00 !
negative	they were supposed to refund me money for a textbook i never received .
negative	i went through alot hussle and bussel to get that refund !
negative	along with that , paypal had no history of me making a purchase but it was charged on my card !!!!
negative	after a while , i finally got a hold of a real_person and they said they would refund and apologized .
negative	guess what ?!
negative	never received the refund !
negative	worst .
negative	company .
negative	ever .
negative	like others here i wish i had dug a little deeper before placing an order with optics_fast .
negative	check out better business_bureau for all the major complaints .
negative	my story goes like this :
negative	placed order may 00th .
negative	problem0 : i received contradictory emails from becky_s that my glasses had been received and sent to lab on three different dates ( so first few_times was probably a lie to get_rid of me ).
negative	on june_00th i wrote " this is the second time you have said that the glasses just arrived and the third time you have said that they are going to the lab , so i believe this to be untrue " she replied " when were you told that ?
negative	they just came in and we already started working on the lens ".
negative	i sent then copy and paste '_s of the emails she sent , she replied " not sure whee these dates came from , but i will give you a discount " * spelling mistake was in the original email from becky_s
negative	problem 0 : on june_00th i received the following from becky_s " the lab needs to redo the lenses and they cracked the initial lens .
negative	i will have them redo it and of course you will get a discount .".
negative	so i tried to cancel my order which then came the reply " we can cancel but there would be a 00_% cancelation_fee as we began the work .
negative	i will make it beneficial to you "
negative	problem 0 : june_00th they withdrew the funds from my bank_account .
negative	they telephoned and told me they have the glasses in front of them , they will refund me my express services i had paid and they will discount me $_00 +.
negative	they will send them off to be packed and shipped .
negative	problem 0 : july_00th still no tracking_number for my shipment , over 00 emails sent between 00th - 00th trying to get an answer when will i be refunded and when will my glasses ship .
negative	problem 0 : july_00th received glasses .
negative	prescription is incorrect so i take the new glasses to an opticians , they read the lenses with a special machine ( probably a lenometer ) and confirm the prescription in the right lens is totally off ( they are 000 instead of 00 ).
negative	i write to becky_s with info and scan of document from opticians and i get the reply " all prescriptions are final sale ."
negative	and " i just confimred your uv and anti scratch because the technician did the rx and lens " .
negative	when asked what becky_s has to say to the pdf i sent she replies " that is not the proof , what needs to be done is a lenometer reading .
negative	so now you are singing a different tune ?"
negative	problem 0 : the lenses also do not have the following i have paid for :
negative	scratch_resistant coating
negative	ultraviolet protection ( uv )
negative	anti_- reflective_coating .
negative	problem 0 : when i asked what they would need from me in the form of a respected optician looking at the glasses and verifying what they do and do not have , i received this answer " there is no such thing as a official inspection , but your own eyes ".
negative	now becky_s asks me to return the glasses to them .
negative	no chance .
negative	if other reviews are true then i would never get them back .
negative	so i '_m still fighting for a refund and will_continue to do so .
negative	we made a purchase a couple of weeks prior to this one and were charged an $ 0 . 00_dollar extra_charge and this time again .
negative	we are very unhappy with the slow process and after_spending over $_000 . 00 dollars you still charge two seporate charges of a $ 0 . 00 totaling $ 0 . 00 and now our package is a week late before shipping .
negative	i don_'_t understand the delay because the money was removed the day of purchase and now we have to wait and wait .
negative	please forward our order at once .
negative	i ordered a $_000_+ in vitamins promised by fiday and received nothing yet very poor service i want 00_%_off if you want my business
negative	i ordered a card , paid_extra to get it sent overnight .
negative	0 days_later , not only was the card not where it was supposed to be , it hadnt even been manufactured yet .
negative	then , i called to cancel it , but at 0pm on a friday_afternoon , there was no one availble in that department to cancel the order .
negative	finally got an_email that it was cancelled tuesday the next week .
negative	however the card then arrived at the destination on friday of that week - a full 0 week after i had cancelled it and 0_weeks after i had ordered it shipped overnight .
negative	right hand and left hand seem to now know what is going on .
negative	dont_waste your time or money if you have a quick need .
negative	go to your local_grocery_store and buy it in person and ship via_fedex - easier , cheaper , quicker
negative	i ordered 0 giftcards last_week and paid_extra to have it here before christmas but it '_s not here !
negative	i never received tracking so i have no way of knowing if it shipped or not !
negative	terrible !
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	this is the second time you have not issued me a refund .
negative	when i booked the hotel through your site , their was no cancellation_fee with 00_hrs notice .
negative	when i called due to a personal matter trying to cancel my reservation , they stated i would lose all my money .
negative	when i got the request to review how i liked my order , i thought it meant that the order should have arrived .
negative	wrong !
negative	it wouldn_'_t even ship out until over a week_later , and take even longer to arrive .
negative	please - i don_'_t need more confusion in my life !
negative	my experince is very bad i need to return parts and i have no help from anyone from the company .
negative	to return my parts will cost me $_000 .
negative	00 they supply me with no return_label , no recipt of my purchase nothing at all .
negative	this was one of the worst experince ever now i have the incorrect parts and i dont_know how to get my money back or the correct parts .
negative	i placed my order on 00 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	never received the products nor a refund . on jan 0 0000 i was told i i wolud receive my refund in 0 - 00 days .
negative	guess what , no refund !!!
negative	on the 00th i was hung_up on .
negative	on the 00r i was told the web_site was down , so what where is my refund .
negative	this company is a fraud !!!
negative	don_'_t order from them .
negative	you will lose !!
negative	!
negative	first they sold me a purse that was out of stock .
negative	wrote offered a measely 00_%_off another one i called then several_times rejecting this offer saying i wanted to get another purse that was 0 . 00 dollars more no responce in about 0_weeks finly i emaled them because i kept getting answering machines and no call backs no response to my email then a while later i recieve a email notice my order has_been shiped no response befor that say ing were sorry for what happned we are sending your choice just the insulting heres you order highly inapropreat way to treat a repeat_customer beware shopping here
negative	i reserved my room through_expedia and they gave_me the wrong hotel in the wrong location .
negative	i tried to change my room through customer_service and they gave_us the run_around for two hours .
negative	i was told that customer_service higher personal will call me back in 00_hrs , it has_been over 0 hrs and nothing .
negative	do not book from them !!
negative	!
negative	i just signed_up with identity_guard and immediately received a notification stating that i had to speak with customer_service before i could continue .... i have now been " staying on the line " for over 00_minutes and have yet to hear an actual_person .
negative	this is not professional customer_service !!
negative	!
negative	we booked 0 tickets as a surprise for my son to see biffy clyro on 00 / 00 / 00 back in january id :_0000000 .
negative	we were under the impression that we had etickets and they would be emailed to us .
negative	however , we ' d had no correspondence so i contacted viagogo yesterday and they mailed back to say they couldn_'_t get hold of the seller so would we accept alternative tickets , different block , different row .
negative	id :_0000000 being quite easy going we accepted this , but then got the confirmation_email_saying that we had to pick the tickets up from your manchester office between 00pm and 0 . 00pm on the same day .
negative	i kept emailing back telling them this was not possible for us as we live nowhere_near manchester and both myself and my husband are in work that day , but we keep getting the reply that we have to collect them .
negative	viagogo could not supply our original order , without letting us know , and now they '_ve changed it they are expecting us to lose 0 days wages to pick_up the tickets from their incompetence .
negative	i have sent two emails asking for an agent to ring me and still_waiting ............... and to add_insult to injury they have the cheek to add a delivery charge !!!
negative	so frustrated !
negative	latest update , an agent named adam rang me yesterday , i explained it would be near impossible to get to manchester tomorrow before 0 . 00pm and he said he was not promising but he ' d do everything he could to help .
negative	got a voice_mail back from him 0 hours_later to say there was nothing he could do !!!
negative	so thanks to viagogo i am now having to ask a college to take my days list of patients and my husband is losing a days work !
negative	i will never use this site again !
negative	and the last update ........ got to manchester and picked_up the tickets myself ...... i presume that viagogo will do the decent thing and refund my delivery charges !!!
negative	!
negative	i found out after i was checking out that i was charged $_00 more than the hotel actually charged .
negative	i was charged for a breakfast and parking , both of which the hotel doesn_'_t charge for .
negative	very displeased with the overcharge by bookit . com and i '_ll not be using it again .
negative	i didnt care what my parts cost .
negative	i was looking for something time effective .
negative	what could be easier than going online and ordering the part myself ?
negative	wrong .
negative	shop around .
negative	i think tomorrow will be day 00 after i placed order and it still hasnt shipped .
negative	just found the second email_saying now they need my credit_card number again ?
negative	wtf_?
negative	i gave it to you almost 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i am over it .
negative	would not recommend .
negative	i have already told my coworkers of this bad_experience .
negative	due to a glitch in your software .. although the flights were " no_longer available at that price " ...
negative	i click and you held my money , did this twice before opening another browser tab .. do you held my credit_card for over $ 0000 .
negative	customer crevice unable to fix / answer why , and wwwaaaayyy too much time spent on it with them .
negative	hate you now
negative	we ordered a left mirror for a ford_ranger truck .
negative	we received confirmation and tracking_information .
negative	the packaged arrived --- yeah and it is exactly_what we ordered .
negative	then we find 0 charges on our visa and a second different mirror arrives a few_days_later !!.
negative	no email_confirmation , no paperwork , nothing --- just charged .
negative	we have pointed_out that we did not order this product , but so_far no cooperation on getting there product back to them .
negative	what lousey customer_service this has turned_out to be .
negative	very dissapointing .
negative	if it was a legitimate charge , we would have the same communications via_email that supported the legitimate purchase .
negative	i somehow ended on this site after google_search for quality inn .
negative	i asked if this was the motel and was told yes .
negative	charged my account thirty dollars .
negative	never was told of the fee and had i knew i wouldn_'_t have stayed connected .
negative	very dishonest !
negative	do not buy anything from yesstyle . com !!
negative	!
negative	" yesstyle . com is not a online fashion shopping company .
negative	yesstyle . com is a company to test your patience . "
negative	- please read the following message to find out why ...
negative	this is a true story .
negative	it happened to me right now on may 0000 .
negative	shopping at yesstyle is very unpleasant .
negative	the better way to describe : it was a nightmare !
negative	i swear to you with my heart .
negative	it really is !
negative	i paid a lot of money to place couple different orders .
negative	i get some of the items , but mostly i get a lot of disappointments .
negative	0 .
negative	missing items :
negative	sometimes , they don_’ t have the items you saw online .
negative	you placed your order and paid the money … then you started the longest period of waiting in your life .
negative	they will make you wait for two_weeks .
negative	two_weeks_later , when you thought your items should be finally on their way .... slowly you start to realize that they don_'_t even have them .
negative	the worst part is , they will not contact you to let you know .
negative	you will have to wait for two_weeks … or more days to find out ... by yourself .
negative	0 .
negative	size exchange
negative	don_'_t even_bother doing size exchange .
negative	i waited for a month .
negative	i have completely forgotten what the shoes i bought look like .
negative	i still no_idea about them .
negative	yesstyle do not know where they are , and they have no answer when am i get the shoes exchange .
negative	perphaps , it will never happen .
negative	yesstyle is a company to test their customer '_s patience and reaction .
negative	i guess they really don_’ t care .
negative	yesstyle - the worst online shopping company i have ever met in my life .
negative	unless you want to waste your money then go to them , otherwise , don_’ t go there !
negative	i am being very honest to every_single word i said in here .
negative	i completely understand they have to deal with complicated orders everyday .
negative	as a customer , what am i looking for is a very simple concept .
negative	i simply want nothing , but the items i paid .
negative	how simple can it be ?
negative	i paid and i owe yesstyle nothing ..... in return ....
negative	i get no items ... wasted a lot of time and energy .
negative	i have had the run_around no kidding talked to over 00 agents just to get service installed properly and things are still not right .
negative	i booked a suite at suites on south_beach in miami for two_nights july 0rd & 0th 0000 .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel we were told that they could not find our reservation .
negative	i gave them my confirmation from hotelsclick . com and they said they would call us when they figured it out .
negative	we were fine with that because we were off to the beach .
negative	they called us about two hours_later to tell us that it looked like when the site ( hotelsclcik . com ) had sent the booking the hotel had replied that they were full .
negative	the site never contacted us in any form .
negative	the hotel said that fortunately they had a room at their sister hotel two blocks_away .
negative	we accepted that room .
negative	the suites on south_beach has a kitchenette with a full size refrigerator and a sink and microwave and utensils .
negative	we were booked into a suite ( one room , not really a suite ) with only a mini_fridge in it .
negative	we brought food to cook for breakfast and snacks for late at night .
negative	we could not use this food .
negative	when the trip was over i received a receipt from the hotel for about $_00 less per_night for than the suites on south_beach .
negative	i emailed customer_service at hotelsclick . com and i also opened a dispute with amex .
negative	hotelclick . com responded that they wanted paperwork which i sent them .
negative	they replied about tone month later that since i was upgraded to a suite at the sister hotel they did not owe me any refund .
negative	they said the suite had a mini_fridge and the original hotel we booked had only a mini_fridge and a microwave .
negative	they said the hotel where we stayed had a microwave available for use if we went down to the main desk and asked for them to cook food for us .
negative	i replied again with my receipt copies , a picture from the website of the original hotel showing a full size refrigerator and actual room that was a kitchenette .
negative	i copied amex with my dispute number .
negative	the next_day amex credited my account for the entire charge .
negative	two_days_later i received a reply from hotelsclick . com that they would refund $_00 . 00 to my credit_card because our room did not have a microwave .
negative	i told them they did not need to credit my card because my credit_card company already had .
negative	i told them i was disappointed that they couldn_'_t meet their obligations and then couldn_'_t even refund the difference_between the price of the two hotels .
negative	i don_'_t expect a reply since amex has already credited the charge .
negative	also , hotelsclick . com sent my reservation to somewhere called jumbo tours making it even harder to find the reservation .
negative	what would have happened if there was no room at the sister hotel and i was stuck in miami on a holiday with no room ?
negative	i would be extremely wary of using this site no_matter_how much_cheaper they look .
negative	they obviously have no scruples or business_ethics .
negative	ink purchased does not work .
negative	printer does not reconize it .
negative	it took at_least two hours of my time to help the hotel find my reservation .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	the hotel was wonderful and treated me with respect unlike the others we had to deal with to find the reservation /
negative	i ordered several bones and chews .
negative	they were all thrown in the box without_any type of packing paper / cushioning .
negative	when the box arrived the side was torn_open by the bones .
negative	there was also no receipt .
negative	nothing , just a box of bones .
negative	i placed an order for 0 suits and a backpack at 00 : 00 on a wednesday , and paid for overnight shipping .
negative	five of the suits were team suits for kids on our swim team .
negative	i called thursday_morning for a tracking_number , only to be told they didn_'_t ship the day before even_though the order was in by the 00 : 00 deadline .
negative	this was due to computer problems and was promised i ' d have all items in hand by friday .
negative	i called again on thursday_afternoon for a tracking_number , and was told 0 of my items were either on back order or discontinued , even thought the website and customer_service rep had both showed they were available the day before when i double_checked availability .
negative	the original rep was quite rude and could only say it wasn_'_t their fault .
negative	i asked to speak with the manager who too told me it wasn_'_t their fault , and apologized .
negative	after pushing him a bit , he gave_me an extra 00_%_off my items that were available .
negative	the 00_%_discount did not cover the overnight shipping_costs i had to pay to another company to make_sure i had my team suits on time for my swimmers .
negative	i will not be ordering with metro_swim shop again , and have already told a number of other parents on both our club team and our summer team about the horrible experience we had !
negative	!
negative	i requested smoking_rooms and was assured that was what i was getting .
negative	however , when we arrived we had non_- smoking_rooms .
negative	i '_m not happy when i don_'_t get what i paid for .
negative	i called the super 0 toll_free line to book a room in revelstoke bc for april_00th .
negative	the super 0 was booked so the operator offered to find another room - and found one at the sandman .
negative	i was under the impression that the hotels are somehow affiliated - never was i told she was booking me through a website outside of the super 0 computer system .
negative	i was told the charges would be $_000 and i ok ' d everything .
negative	when the charge came through my account i was charged in us funds for a canadian hotel - adding another $_00 .
negative	when i called the number on my confirmation , i was told that i did not book through super 0 system ( they couldn_'_t find my reservation number ) and that i booked through_expedia .
negative	i will never call reservationcounter again - or recommend it .
negative	i will never do_business with your company again .
negative	i purchased tickets and insurance through_travelocity and had to cancel my trip due to business problems , we are self_employed and had to change our plans 0_weeks ahead of time and found out none of our money , insurance of booking fee or airfare was refundable , all i can say is i believe they lead you to believe if you buy insurance you are safe , completely untrue .
negative	everyone i talked to blamed it on someone_else , travelocity blamed delta and delta blamed the insurance company .
negative	all i know is it cost my husband and i 0000 . 00 to go nowhere , absolutely nowhere and no refund whatsoever .
negative	so i will never use travelocity or delta_airlines again and we planned to do more traveling when we retire in a few_years , i guess we will have lots of time then and we will find other means even if it means driving .
negative	i used expedia to book a return flights from london - athens , thira - london .
negative	unfortunately due to unforeseen_circumstances i had to cancel the first leg of my journey and book through another airline , only because there were no suitable flights available through_expedia to reschedule .
negative	i understood that i would not be due a refund for the flight because i cancelled it , however i was advised that i was due a tax refund from the cancelled flight .
negative	on april 00 i was advised that i was due a £_00 tax refund and would receive this in 0 - 00 weeks .
negative	on may 00 i phoned requesting a status_update on my refund to be advised that the airline had not received the refund application from expedia .
negative	expedia reapplied for the tax refund with the airline and i was advised that i was due £_00 , not £_00 , and that i would receive this in 0 - 00 weeks .
negative	on july 0 i phoned requesting a status_update on my refund and was advised that expedia cannot apply for my tax refund until after i have completed the last leg of my flight in august and that it was a £_00 , not £_00 refund and only then should i expect to receive it in 0 - 00 weeks .
negative	expedia have not at any point contacted me to advise me of any_problems with my refund , i have had to contact them and every time have been given incorrect advise .
negative	i have been advised to call them again in august after i have been on holiday to request , once again , that they apply for my refund and that i will have to wait another 0 - 00 weeks to receive the money owed to me .
negative	if i ever receive the money rightfully owed to me i will have waited approximately 0 months for a £_00 or £_00 refund .
negative	i often use sites such as budget air , expedia and edreams and expedia have by_far given the worst customer_service .
negative	i will never use expedia again and would not recommend expedia to anyone .

negative	i ordered boots from this site over a month_ago and still have not received them .
negative	i received a confromation but i still have not received any information about where my product is !!!
negative	i paid $_000 for boots i will never see !!!
negative	wow
negative	i was very disapointed in the label order .
negative	i figure i receive approximately_$_00 . 00 worth of labels , postage and labor .
negative	i paid $_000 . 00 for 000 0x0 " stickers .
negative	they were shipped in a baggie with tape to tie and in a us priority flat_rate mailing envelope .
negative	i designed the label on line , all you had to do was run the labels , cut and ship .
negative	this is such a rip - off .
negative	i was expecting a much_better quality of label for the cost .
negative	i was suspose to get a " hight gloss " " water proof " label but received regular soft paper and not water proof .
negative	they looked cheap and there was nothing extraordinary about them .
negative	i will never recommend or use this company again .
negative	i am a wedding planner , i do a lot of business ..... your loss .
negative	sign by : over charged for cheap merchandise .
negative	let_me start out by saying that if i could give less_than a one star_rating , i would .
negative	five reasons not to buy from global_eyeglasses :
negative	0 .
negative	it took_forever for the glasses to arrive .
negative	in this case , forever means september 0 to september 00 .
negative	do not order these expecting them to arrive within 0 to 00 days .
negative	0 .
negative	customer_service was awful / non_- existent .
negative	i was growing a bit anxious after two_weeks of waiting .
negative	i tried_calling the customer_service line right when their hours of operation started .
negative	i was so delighted to find that i was customer # 0 and that my questions would be answered in ' 0 minute !'
negative	... 00_minutes later , i had moved up to customer # 0 and the wait had somehow increased to ' 0 minutes .'
negative	the entire time , i had been tolerating the same two songs blasting into my room ( no way was i going to listen to that right into my ear ).
negative	finally , when it let_me know i was customer # 0 , it hung_up on me .
negative	i now understand how tom hanks felt when he lost wilson in cast away .
negative	0 .
negative	00 days after i ordered the glasses , i received a tracking_number .
negative	woohoo !
negative	said my brain sarcastically .
negative	by that time , i was less excited about receiving my glasses and more surprised that they still communicated with me .
negative	unfortunately , their tracking_number was either fake or did not work .
negative	i think they send out random numbers to subdue those who would actually riot if they did not get their glasses in time .
negative	0 .
negative	once the glasses did arrive , i was not even one bit excited .
negative	i had already ordered a pair of glasses from coastal .
negative	they arrived in a few_days .
negative	i can '_t even remember how many days it actually took , it was so long ago .
negative	if you think of it this way , ge took almost 0 times longer to deliver my glasses than coastal did !
negative	both cost the same .
negative	anyway , the ge glasses have the same shape as the ones i saw online .
negative	however , that is where the line is drawn .
negative	they are very floppy and loose and the prescription they stuffed into the frames makes me dizzy when i look down .
negative	that might be due to my bitterness at the company though .
negative	i am going to have it looked at by an optometrist .
negative	0 .
negative	the case the glasses came in is of the worst quality .
negative	i feel_like it could be a mcdonald '_s kids meal toy , it '_s so flimsy .
negative	if i had wanted one of those , i ' d have expected a meal to come with it .
negative	unfortunately , if you notice the shipping time , that would come moldy and disgusting too .
negative	i '_m sure that global_eyeglasses was a fantastic company at some point in their lives , but that part of their lives is not now .
negative	i went through so much stress waiting for my pair of glasses to arrive .
negative	it felt_like i was going through a horrible break - up where the other person refused to give me my things back !
negative	unless you like drama and cheap , plastic - y smelling products , i ' d say stay away from global_eyeglasses .
negative	i orderd flowers and chocolates , 0 days before my sisters_birthday , and they never arrived .
negative	despite_being told , twice , that they were with the courier and would be delivered by the end of the week .
negative	the flowers are still m . i . a and i was never contacted by iflorist , with any kind of updates on the flowers whereabouts .
negative	when i contacted online support , to cancel , they said i could not cancel as the flowers were already with the courier !!!!!........ huh !!
negative	!, i '_ve heard that before !!!
negative	i hate to think what condition these flowers are now in , after supposedly being " with the courier " for this long !!
negative	do not use iflorist . com !!!
negative	or " colonial gifts ltd burnley " the name they trade under .
negative	american_express is now investigating the company on my behalf ..... 00 out 0f 00 for dissapointing the birthday girl !
negative	!
negative	they do nothing for you .
negative	unfortunately the controller i ordered my son on december_00th still has not arrived and it is january0rd .
negative	when i called to follow_up the monday before christmas to see the status on the order and see if i needed to buy another santa gift on one answered and all i got was an answering_machine .
negative	my emails were also not answered until after christmas .
negative	unfortunately cannot even rate the product since we still do not have it ..
negative	although ink_cartridges were supposed to be compatible they do not function properly with my printer
negative	" smart post shipping is one of the slowest shipping options we have .
negative	"- fedex employee
negative	customers should have the option to express ship .
negative	customers should also have the option to speak with someone via_telephone .
negative	dear my name_necklace ,
negative	as stated above , when you give someone tracking_information it is so that the person_who has ordered something , paid for it and expects it to arrive at their home ( probably as a gift or such ) can follow its progress , know where it is and be confident in its delivery .
negative	also , a phone_number should be included and a customer_service representative should be able to answer all questions about that order .
negative	people are putting their trust in you to not only take money out of their bank accounts , but to produce a product as_described with confidence .
negative	a thriving business has good contact information , good tracking_information and good customer_service .
negative	# wordstothewise
negative	i sent in a price match_guarantee following the instructions listed on the website .
negative	they never matched the price , and when i emailed customer_service about this i never_heard back with a reply or reason_why i was not given the price - match_guarantee .
negative	this company did not reveal that it was not the hotel website .
negative	it also failed to reveal that i would be charged immediately for the room though the reservation is six_months away .
negative	they also did not reveal that there would be no refund for cancellation no_matter_how far ahead .
negative	the company has rude staff all the way around .
negative	i picked_up my car in rome on 0 / 00 and had difficulty with the staff from the beginning .
negative	first , they weren_'_t taking_care of the customers so there was a line of us waiting around ( for nothing ... nobody was being taken_care of ).
negative	then , some italians walked up and they started giving these_guys service ... so we complained and insisted that the italians go to the end of the line behind all of us who had been waiting 00_minutes already .
negative	then , out of the blue , they finally told us that we had to get a ticket in order to be seen .... so there was a mad dash over to the ticket dispenser ( which hadn_'_t been used for ages )... and even with the tickets , they called the italians to the counter first ( even_though their ticket number came after all of the other 00 - 00 people .
negative	we complained and made them see us first .... which they did but they were speaking italian with the italian customers and gesturing toward us and laughing , so it was evident that they were making fun of us .
negative	then , they gave_us a car that didn_'_t have ac - even_though i paid for one with ac .
negative	i returned the car in venice on 0 / 00 .
negative	my car was due at 00 : 00 am and i arrived at their office at 0 : 00 am .
negative	however , we experienced the same issue with the staff in venice as well ... they were completely ignoring all of the customers in line , they wouldn_'_t look up or even address people .
negative	after waiting about 00_minutes , i jumped the line and went to the counter to ask where i should be dropping_off my car ( i had not been given any instruction on how to handle drop_off even_though i asked in rome and was told to call the company to find out ... very hard to do when i didn_'_t have european access on my phone ).
negative	the lady finally acknowledged me and told me to pull up in front the building and then come_back in line .
negative	i came back in line after moving my car the 0 feet that she required and waited another 00 - 00_minutes and the line wasn_'_t moving .
negative	a man finally came behind the counter and started telling people that they couldn_'_t give them cars because nobody had been dropping cars off (??????).
negative	i yelled out that i had been trying to drop_off my damned car for over half an_hour and that they refused to help me .
negative	they finally let_me drop_off my car and signed my receipt at 00 : 00 ... 00_minutes past the deadline and then they sent me an invoice ( i received it on 0 / 0 ) for an_additional day charge .
negative	this company is a shady - they force you to wait_until after your deadline so they can charge you for an entire extra day .
negative	i will be disputing this with my credit_card company - this scam is totally_unacceptable .
negative	beware !
negative	worst customer_service i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
negative	extremely unprofessional . didn_'_t receive my glasses until a month later after they refused to cancel my order and threatened me with a 00_% cancellation_fee . istill said i wanted the order cancelled and they refused to do it and shipped the glasses when they finally received them .
negative	they say they ship within 00_hours but they don_'_t !!!
negative	they won_'_t cancel your order and they charge a 00_% restocking_fee if you return . they also offer you $_00 to leave them good feedback .
negative	shady !!!
negative	you shouldn_'_t have to bribe your customers for good feedback .
negative	i had been ordering from petco for some time .
negative	the delveries consistently took 0 to 0_weeks to receive .
negative	i consistently ( though not always ) placed the same order ; and i was set_up for " repeat delivery ", and had gotten the " repeat delivery price " several_times .
negative	however : this last time , the price wouldn_'_t ring up right , and kept charging me the $_00 . 00 instead of the $_00 . 00 for " repeat delivery ".
negative	i received no satisfaction from so - called " customer serrvice " ( ha_ha_ha )!
negative	i was even told by one csr that i did not have an account !
negative	so , obviously the site was messed_up .
negative	soooo , instead of just giving me a coupon or something for the $ 0 . 00 (. 00 / box x 0 boxes ) difference in the prices ; they let_me go to another pet_food delivery company !
negative	how stupid !
negative	however : i must thank petco , for their atrocious " customer_service ", because , i went to another pet_food delivery company , and got the same order for $_00 . 00 less ($ 0 . 00 / box x 0 boxes )!!!!!
negative	petco needs to learn how to be nice to their customers !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked online , usually within a fe minutes i get a confirmation_email .
negative	never did .
negative	after about an_hour or two i called .
negative	had to call back three_times because everyone person i spoke to said they couldn_'_t help me they needed to transfer me somewhere_else .
negative	after an_hour on the phone i finally got someone_who said oh you should have an_email poof like magic during my conversation with her i get an_email .
negative	i asked if it was due to paying through paypal though i them for everything else and never had an_issue she couldn_'_t say .
negative	even after the three calls i felt_like the whole purchase and conversations were a scam that i turned around and called the hotel to make_sure it had been sent over .
negative	i always use y ' all when traveling but this is the worst service ever and i am strongly considering changing ,
negative	they were quick to charge me 0st for my 0 parts & deliver ( 0 - 0 days ).
negative	when i emailed them to tell them i only rec ' d 0 of my parts already charged for they told me " they sent email to warehouse but this would take some time " which ended_up being 0 week_later of when i rec ' d the 0st of 0 parts needed to have my car fixed .
negative	this threw me into yet another week of waiting to get my car repaired which was dying while driving .
negative	this was not safe for me to do but they really took their time .
negative	i only shopped with them because my sister suggested them for buying parts .
negative	i had to finally email them info off of my delivery ticket myself before i finally rec ' d part ( i used to work in purchasing & receiving so knew this shouldn_'_t have taken so long to resolve this issue .!)
negative	first time i use them , this stuff happened .
negative	no phone_calls or nothing .
negative	this is the first time i have placed an order with this company and i am very disappointed .
negative	the tracking document shows only the order number , shipping address , and how much i was charged .
negative	there is no_indication that the book has_been shipped .
negative	an unreasonable amount of time has passed and i am in dire need of this book .
negative	would not have ordered through you if i had known it would take this long .
negative	ordering with a coupon was challenging on the website , getting information onto the website was also a challenge .
negative	i finally thought i had it down and the default address kept changing - i didn_'_t spot that the delivery date had changed itself too .
negative	i ordered a christmas bouquet of reds , roses and lilies and christmas greenery ( 00 . 00gbp ) for delivery on friday 00th_december to my mother - in -_law in the u . k . ( i live in the usa ) with a 00_%_discount_coupon .
negative	what i got - or at_least what my mother in law got - was 0 white gerbera , a clump of blue statice and 0 stems of pink chrysanthemums on friday 00th_december .
negative	the flowers probably_won_'_t last until christmas .
negative	she was surprised , but not happily .
negative	i was surprised and furious and very , very , disappointed .
negative	i am awaiting serenta '_s response to my email of complaint and i do expect some_sort of explanation and recompense .
negative	i measured my dogs old collar to make_sure i got the right size .
negative	when i received the new collar it was way too big .
negative	it would cost me more money for postage to send it back so i just took the loss .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i have had to cut this poor plant down to a miniature size as it was almost doa .
negative	the shipping was the same cost as the plant , which didn_'_t please me .
negative	had the plant been big an healthy as_advertised when it arrived i wouldn_'_t be upset .
negative	yours truly , cranky customer .
negative	i was sent the wrong frames that looked used and had to call multiple_times .
negative	bad customer_service .
negative	do not recommend at all !
negative	i had quite a large order , but as it was a gift , i wasn_'_t sure of te size .
negative	first i have been given wrong advice , asking about the fit of the nike_tennis polo / t - shirts and beeing told that if my husband was 0m00 , i should switch my initial order of large size in xl .
negative	result , i had to return all the polo court / t - shirts to exchange for a size l . they didn_'_t bother to offer me the return cost ( my order was about £_000 though ).
negative	while returning the items , i sent a email listing the returns items and what size i needed to make_sure they will hold it until they receive my parcel .
negative	i received a positive answer then .
negative	by the way , in the meantime , i saw the same items in a quite expensive shop , but about £_00 cheaper !
negative	but when they had to sent the items , i have been told that the person in charge forgot to do it as a result , they were happy to exchange then with the same items with different colour ... with an_additional_cost which almost double what i already paid !
negative	in spite having said they had the correct items and that they will keep it until receiving few_days_later my parcel for exchange , tennis_nuts didn_'_t respect its agreement /
negative	if you order there , make_sure you will be happy to pay an expensive return cost in case - while most web sites offer return_label free of charge - and prepare yourself being told they don_'_t have the items anymore , but they can kindly offer you to double your cost exchanging for the same item in another color !
negative	overall , bad advice resulting in a return at a expensive cost , spoiled birthday having the wrong_size , ... and at the end having to cancel everything because they didn_'_t have the right size and i didn_'_t want to pay double price for an other color !
negative	before ordering there , don_'_t do like me , have a search on internet , many other web_site a more reliable and go check the price in the shops , many shops are selling the same things cheaper !
negative	and if you do , make_sure you will never ever have to return anything :-)
negative	i placed an order in the early_morning on may 00 .
negative	i purchase a month supply each_month with normally one week grace period till supply is gone .
negative	on the following_wednesday , i realized the shipment had not been shipped so made three different calls .
negative	i told them i needed the shipment by friday and was assured they would " take_care of it '- i could have stopped the order and simply purchased locally , but they said they would correct it .
negative	still nothing until late thursday and another call .
negative	but the shipment was only just done and with no special handling leading to yet another possible 0 day delay at_least .
negative	i had asked to talk to a supervisor every time i called - none returned the call for three_days .
negative	they lied about shipping date , as fed_ex verified the actual time .
negative	then on face book they lied again openly , saying they had ' tried ' to call me .
negative	i carry a cell 00 / 0 and there were no calls and no missed calls .
negative	finally after 0 days a supervisor did call and admitted to the above situation , no calls , wrong ship date etc and then had the audacity to offer 00_%_off my ' next order " what ????
negative	so no dog_food for my dogs is just fine with these people considering once they have your money , the welfare of your dog is the last thing on their mind .
negative	the next offer was $_00 ..... i must assume they find a small sack of old roy just fine rather then the excellent nutrition my dogs are used too .
negative	on the whole , i will never recommend this company , money is their only real interest , there are some great dog_food delivery companies available .
negative	any other would be a better choice .
negative	vom echo wald kennel
negative	i was not wowed_by the service i received at all .
negative	very bad , unacceptable experience
negative	the website offered promotion for $_000 gift_card for restaurants . com .
negative	when i received the confirmation , the promotional gift_card was nowhere to be found .
negative	the customer_service representative was no help at all .
negative	in fact , she essentially implied that i must have misread the website and there '_s nothing she could do to help me .
negative	not to mention that she lacked patience and had an attitude problem .
negative	if you don_'_t have people skills , you should really consider another career path .
negative	never booking with this company again .
negative	i cannot_believe this company !!!
negative	they really should not be able to get away with the crap they try to pull !
negative	i ordered a dress for myself and my daughter ( who was going to be the flower girl ).
negative	the dress was ordered on 0 / 00 and i expedited the shipping for an extra fee of over $_00 !!
negative	i then happened to check the status of the dress to find out it was estimated to be shipped on 0 / 0 / 00 !
negative	the wedding is this friday !!!
negative	so , i demanded to have the order cancelled b /_c it was still in the freaking long ' processing ' period .
negative	well , today i get this response from them stating that not only will they continue with the order but that they will only be reimbursing me only the for the expedited_shipping fee !
negative	i am furious !!
negative	i wrote back to their behind and told them that they can '_t just make up the rules as they go and please and to refund me fully .
negative	i will be taking legal_action if they try to continue with the order and will also be reporting them to the ' better business of bureau ' as well .
negative	i can '_t_believe_how unprofessional they '_ve been !
negative	and if i could give them no stars i would !
negative	the fact that they don_'_t have an actual phone_number is what i wish i had picked_up on - mad shady people who steal your money !
negative	beware , do not order from this company !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a hotel in mexico for my daughter for spring_break .
negative	all of her flights were cancelled due to the weather .
negative	we called the hotel the day before to ask if we could get our money back and the hotel said yes no_worries but we had to call travelocity .
negative	i spent an_hour and a half on the phone with travelocity while they lied to me and said they had to speak to the hotel and finally they said they would call me back within 00_hours and give me a resolution .
negative	i got a call back from them a month later saying we weren_'_t getting our money back .
negative	i searched online for some time looking for what i thought would be a great company for us to send flowers to family that had their first child in vienna .
negative	i did exactly as the site asked , where were the flowers going , to whom and a local phone_number for them to contact if needed ?
negative	well , it was needed .
negative	the flowers were not delivered to them on time and they never received a phone_call asking such things as where they could be delivered to since they were no_longer at the hospital or letting them know they had eventually been delivered to the hospital giving them the option to go pick them up should they choose .
negative	i will never use this company again nor will i recommend them either .
negative	we booked a hotel through_travelocity , prepaid .
negative	when we arrived we were charged again by the hotel ; that took over an_hour to resolve .
negative	the place turned_out to be filthy with black mold in the bathroom walls .
negative	the bed was horribly saggy and uncomfortable , and there were only two very small pillows .
negative	the continental_breakfast was just some lukewarm coffee ( and there wasn_'_t even enough left for 0 cups when we left just before 0am ) and a couple of bins of dry cereal .
negative	the parking_lot was torn up .
negative	i complained to travelocity and they said that since i prepaid the room they would not provide us another location or refund our money .
negative	very bad_experience .
negative	the staff at the hotel was nice , but the place should not be open for business , especially due to the mold .
negative	i would be very hesitant to use this service again .
negative	i paid for what i understood to be an all_inclusive rental for a vehicle for 0 week .
negative	the thrifty car_rental desk at san_francisco was manned by the most untrustworthy and sly individuals i have experienced in almost 00 years of travel .
negative	after we presented our voucher from driveway . com . au each driver was asked to sign the bottom of a paper tape ( about 0 . 0 metres long ) which simply verified they had a license and agreed to drive in a lawful manner and accept any fines , parking infringements etc .
negative	after a 00 hour flight we were happy to be on our way .
negative	upon our return we were charged an_additional_$_000 . 00 for an upgraded vehicle , fuel , etc etc .
negative	when we questioned it we were thrown the 0 . 0 metre long tape which included additional_charges , for just about everything you could imagine , including a refueling surcharge + an airport refueling fee .
negative	never truster this organization or thrifty at san_francisco airport - they are shifty not thrifty .
negative	look up our facebook_page and like for more details .
negative	bestilte noget tøj over deres hjemmeside , som sku ' komme indenfor 0 uger .

negative	beder dem om at annullere min_ordre , og de siger at jeg_vil få mine_penge retur inden for 0 dage .
negative	efter 0 - 00 dage er pengene stadig ikke kommet ind .
negative	bliver så nødt til at skrive til_dem igen , for så at vente yderligere 0 dage .. fuldstændig til grint ..
negative	i purchased 0 items and having not read there was a next_day delivery i just saw the dispatched date when tracking my products .
negative	i didn_'_t know where they were coming from and how many days it might take .
negative	a week went by and when i rung customer_service they informed me the items had been delivered the day after ordering then once more after that with photographic evidendience of the couriers outside twice however the two times they came they never left a card through my door telling_me they had been or a time to rearrange .
negative	no email or call either so i was unaware or this having come or in the second visit when that even might have been !!!.
negative	i was ask to pay for re delivery £_00 .
negative	it would be next_day but between_0am and 0pm .
negative	forget it i paid the £_00 and cancelled the order .
negative	precious_little things use a crooked courier service and i '_m sure i '_m not the only customer to have been stung .
negative	i '_ve never had such problems with amazon or royal_mail .
negative	drop_off no problem at all .... however the collection took 00_minutes and 0 phone_calls to get the car back to us !!
negative	after a long flight , with 0 kids , and rain .
negative	it was not a stress_free pick_up :( all the representatives and drivers passed the blame to someone_else , insisting the car was on the nearest car_park and would only take 0 mins to bring round ..... so why did it take 00 ??????
negative	?
negative	i received my package and the box was open .
negative	i thought okay it must be the usps '_s fault for not handling the box well and then i opened the package and noticed how poorly packaged my product was .
negative	i ordered a replacement_mirror for my car and i was flabbergasted to see that it was put inside a cloth bag .. no bubble_wrap , no styrofoam , no nothing !
negative	that '_s it .. just a piece of cloth .
negative	they didn_'_t even give courtesy to reprint the receipt or anything .
negative	just the mirror inside a cloth bag .
negative	seriously ?
negative	it '_s a mirror !
negative	package it better !
negative	i need to speak with a representative & was unable to get through when i called tuesday .
negative	arrived at kings_cross and planned to use green line link into london centre but using map printed from your website was totally unalbe to locate the stop for the buses and had to pay for taxi instead .
negative	after visit to hamleys toys store ( marked on your map ) searched in vain again to fiind a stop where we could join the bus .
negative	several buses drove past but the did not stop , none of the bus_stops showed any markings for the tour althogh your web map indicated their position .
negative	forced to walk too far ( i have parkinsons and this " hop on hop_off " service was supposed to help me !!!!)
negative	and again forced to take taxi - never used our prepaid ticket - very unhappy .
negative	i am very displeased with it store .
negative	they are once again tricked me .
negative	i will be very actively recommend to all to not used your store !
negative	theirs bonus is " free delivery worldwide .." - the full fraud !
negative	after i has made another order , they sent me a letter - " thank_you for your order and payment .
negative	unfortunately , this order does not qualify for free delivery due to the weight .
negative	if you would still like us to send the order it will be an extra £_00_pound sterling ."
negative	i refused , but they have already removed money from my card .
negative	and while back , a week passed , i lost time and $ 0 for unnecessary transaction
negative	i ordered almost 0_weeks_ago and still have not got my order ?
negative	can someone please contact me i have tried_calling several_times .
negative	went through the usual work of filling in trivia information which some is erelevant to the sale , ad to your cart , bla , bla , bla .
negative	their price is pretty good but then at check out they hit you with a $_00 . 00 shipping charge for only six little bags , i have had so many christmas purchases shipped for much less_than that .
negative	what a waist of time ...
negative	it said 0 . 00 then when paid is was 0 . 00 why not tell it upfront that is the price
negative	our 0 hr flight turned into 00_hours , which caused us to lose an entire day of vacation w_/ family !
negative	maybe it was delta_airlines that made the changes , but they diverted us from a trip from sacramento to seattle to anchorage to sac to salt_lake city to st paul , mn to anchorage .
negative	aaaaarrrrrggggghhhh !
negative	never again !
negative	i have ordered from this site twice , my first order took 0_weeks to deliver , but i was happy that i got it .
negative	it was delivered to my house without_any problem .
negative	however , the second time i received my order i have to pay over $_00 for taxes .
negative	the second time is only took 0_weeks .
negative	but over $_00 for taxes and with no warning ...........
negative	i did not expected this , because i didn_'_t have to pay for taxes on my first order .
negative	my first order was over $_000 , my second order was less_than that !!
negative	!
negative	later , i found that it was because the second order was shipped by a different company .
negative	so i emailed them and request for an explanation of why the inconsistency with shipment and the charges .
negative	their reply was that : they " cannot guarantee or estimate any customs - related levy ".
negative	i would love to wait longer and not to get charged .
negative	costumer_service was not helpful at all .
negative	their answer was can '_t guarantee & they have completed their " obligation "!!!!!
negative	can '_t they at_least investigate ???
negative	well , i can guarantee that i will not buy from this site again !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a bridesmaid_dress on july 0nd for an october_00th_wedding .
negative	i paid $_00 for the 0 - 0 week rush_cut .
negative	after several panicked calls to ps_bridal , my dress was finally shipped on october 0rd .
negative	it was shipped 0 - day express through the usps and i had to go pick it up from the post_office myself on oct . 0th .
negative	thanks , ps_bridal , for getting my dress to me 0 days before the wedding !
negative	i want my $_00 back .
negative	order has still not shipped and even went back on cart even after paying for item through paypal .
negative	will not buy from again !!
negative	!
negative	wow , really disappointed .
negative	i ordered over 00 shirts and when i called and told them that i needed 0 more , the price went from $ 0 . 00 to $_00 . 00 / shirt .
negative	i would not recommend this site !
negative	i ordered the part and then got an_email_stating it was delivered when i go on the ups linc sent from parts_geek it says that it was delivered to someone named wooten in charlotte sc i am in california .
negative	when i go to call them no one answers they tell you to go to the website which doesn_'_t have a selection for we delivered to the wrong_address .
negative	i checked my order confirmation and my address was correct .
negative	i can '_t really rate this product i would love to give it a good review if i could receive it ... i ' d really like someone to help this happen .
negative	not sure what the angel name referred to .
negative	it clinks a bit but doesn_'_t chime .
negative	i thank the gem_tree for explaining my misunderstanding .
negative	i tried to use an old existing credit from a cancellation .
negative	it was still valid .
negative	after over 0 hours of back and forth with 0 different customer_service representatives i was told that i should go and see if the airline would give me a refund for the flight because despite the fact that they could find my reservation their system was having a problem and they couldn_'_t book it .
negative	i called the airline and they couldn_'_t find the ticket number that expedia had given me .
negative	i called expedia back .
negative	i had to answer all the same questions and sit on hold all over again .
negative	i was again told to contact united .
negative	when i protested this i was put on hold again for another 00_minutes .
negative	i asked to speak to a manager repeatedly and was never transferred to one .
negative	they won_'_t issue a refund even_though it is their fault .
negative	i '_m extremely irritated and will never ever use expedia again !
negative	i ordered lafont glasses from them .
negative	after a month , the frame is peeling and when i complained they were useless and said to contact the company .
negative	lafont says they are not distributors and they use no decals .
negative	these are knockoffs !!!!
negative	i paid almost $_000 for fake frames .
negative	and there is nothing i can do about it .
negative	i feel dumb , yes , but pissed is more like it .
negative	do not use this company !!!
negative	!
negative	i am appalled at the total lack of responsibility to the customer .
negative	i was not notified my items were back ordered .
negative	both inquiries i sent were ignored .
negative	this behavior by a vendor is woefully inadequate in today '_s economic environment .
negative	i would not order a band - aid from them if they shipped it air express !
negative	jodie n .
negative	they charged my credit_card $_000 .
negative	but nothing else .
negative	no confirmation that anything was delivered .
negative	i only received a coupon for another order .
negative	00_%_off .
negative	00_%_off for nothing .
negative	great deal .
negative	i tried to chat with them , two support people split on me .
negative	don_'_t use them !

negative	i first thought i was using the reservation center at the actual hotel but after i booked it i realized it was not the actual hotel .
negative	then i tried to change my reservation rate because an event i was attending had a special rate and we are tax exempt but i was not allowed to change the reservation or cancel without losing all of my money .
negative	so did not have a good experience .
negative	never had reserved a room where i could not modify or change a reservation .
negative	nor have i ever booked a room 0 months in advance that i could not get a refund the same day i book it .
negative	terrible situation and will never use this company again .
negative	this is the worst company ever .
negative	they threatened to break glasses i sent in for return a month_ago because i didn_'_t want to pay 000 . 00 repair when i could buy a new pair for that .
negative	i also bought a pair of chanel sunglasses but didn_'_t like how they fit so i wanted to exchange .
negative	they do not exchange but charge a 00_percent restock_fee so you better like what you order .
negative	overall i have done allot of online shopping and never had problems like this .
negative	i have all the exchange of emails that becky_s the owner of optisfast has exchange with me .
negative	she is holding my glasses now stating that if i dont remove reviews i will not get my glasses back .
negative	she has_been threatening me this entire exchange
negative	i thought the lantern was going to be much bigger_than it is .
negative	i ended_up not using it and the cost of shipping plus to return was more than the item cost .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	never use bookit . com !
negative	three_days before leaving for my honeymoon i was reading_reviews about where we were going and found out that the hotel had been sold and was closing the day before we were to arrive .
negative	i received no call from bookit . com about this , i called them to find out if it was true and they had no_idea it was closed .
negative	i hate to think what would have happened if we had not seen this and had arrived with suitcases in hand and no place to stay .
negative	i spent the next two_days trying to book something_else but at the late date the only things that had openings for two_weeks were more_expensive and bookit . com said i had to stay at the same price !
negative	we went on our_honeymoon and had a good time because it was our_honeymoon but it was not where we wanted or what we wanted ( the beach was horrible and very small and this was our biggest wish for our_honeymoon ).
negative	i tried to get compensated from bookit . com , sent letters to the corporate office and spent lots of time on the phone .
negative	they did offer us a free hotel for a weekend in jamaica ( but for 0 nights in jamaica we had to pay the airfare , not really a deal ).
negative	plus , if we took this deal we had to sign a waiver saying we ' d not discuss the situation with anyone !!!
negative	i think they should have paid the difference for the more_expensive trip ( we were talking less_than $_000 !)
negative	or they should have upgraded us at_least at the hotel .
negative	bookit . com did nothing !
negative	they also said if i did not respond in 0 days that i would forfeit the offer and they would consider the issue closed .
negative	i spoke with them but they still closed it with no resolution .
negative	i wish they would make this right for me but apparently customer opinion is not important .
negative	don_'_t ever us bookit . com ..... try cheapcarribean . com , they are way better .
negative	every time i call , it doesn_'_t connect me with anyone , it just asks me to leave a message .
negative	i accidentally canceled my booked hotel and have been charged $_00 . 00 .
negative	i want to keep my room and reverse this charge , but i cannot get_ahold of anyone .
negative	still trying to get my money from these thieves , who used to trade under electrictshirts . co . uk .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled !!!!!
negative	i ordered a t - shirt in july , never received it , and despite repeated_requests from me and ' promises ' from them to refund my money , it hasn_'_t happened .
negative	i '_ll just keep on until they comply .
negative	i don_'_t take kindly to being_ripped_off .
negative	i ordered two pet lights for my dogs - one turns its self off and the other the battery was dead after one use .....
negative	we took the goldentour tour to blenheim and the cotswolds today sept 00 , 0000 .
negative	we have taken golden_tours / grayline tours in lots of places and have enjoyed the trips we took .
negative	this tour was a major disappointment because of the tour_guide and how the company handled its delay in getting started .
negative	we were picked_up at the golden tour visitor centre kensington one hour after the designated pickup time .
negative	from the time we got on the bus , throughout the entire tour and after we were unceremoniously left to fend for ourselves at the end of the hammersmith underground line , geoffrey provided negative descriptions of everything , poor descriptions with lots of " i don_'_t know " and constantly complained_about running behind schedule .
negative	when we got off the bus at all but the last stop at birbury he literally disappeared without explanation .
negative	not even an " i '_ll be right back after i get the tickets ".
negative	very unprofessional .
negative	at blenheim we were left without entry tickets .
negative	when we finally found geoffrey he was passing out tickets one by one in a rude manner , refusing to give one person of a couple 0 / both tickets .
negative	a lot of the time we could have spent enjoying blenheim was wasted looking for geoffrey .
negative	at the stop for lunch in burford he was no where to be seen when we got off the bus and we did not know where we supposed to go for the lunch we opted to include with the tour .
negative	again , not even the professional courtesy to let the people on the bus where we were supposed to go .
negative	by the way , the lunch was terrible .
negative	at blenheim , in order to make up time , geoffrey cut our visit short .
negative	we were at blenheim , the primary stop on your tour , less_than 0 0 / 0 hours .
negative	it would have been 00_minutes shorter_than that if the people on the bus had not spoken up and complained .
negative	geoffrey kept mentioning that we were going to cut short the last stop at bibury by not walking along the river .
negative	the tour did walk along the river though .
negative	after bibury on the drive back to london geoffrey constantly complained that we were not going to make it back by 0 : 00_pm and he would try to get everyone to the hammersmith station but there were no guarantees .
negative	that was totally_unacceptable and we had no choice but to be dumped at the end of the hammersmith line .
negative	no one with golden tour , neither geoffrey nor the bus driver , offered any assistance with train fare or getting the correct train .
negative	golden tour is in the tour business .
negative	the tour descriptions state " estimated " time back in london .
negative	they are responsible for getting back their customers into london as implied .
negative	they are responsible for being aware of traffic conditions and driver time .
negative	instead of dumping us off somewhere they should have sent another driver if there was a problem .
negative	they failed to look after our well being on this tour .
negative	we really wanted to see and enjoy blenheim palace .
negative	this tour did not allow us to do so .
negative	we were given a small refund , which was totally inadequate compensation for golden_tours unprofessional tour_guide and handling of their delay
negative	will not use golden_tours in the uk again .
negative	rent a car and drive .
negative	i asked for a specific hotel and was booked for an entirely different hotel that showed_up on my confirmation_email .
negative	their terms and policy are just the wort never ever again in my life am i evet booking a flight ticket in this website again !
negative	!
negative	tried to get travel_insurance for myself and husband plus golf equipment , selected it charged three_times and on the documents it clearly_stated golf equipment not covered !!!
negative	don_'_t consider this company as you don_'_t get what you want !!
negative	!
negative	my husband and i had been saving for quite some time for our recent honeymoon , and due to various advertisements we saw with priceline , we decided to use this company to get the best " bang for our buck ."
negative	easily the worst choice we made .
negative	first , priceline booked us to leave on a tuesday_morning to return on sunday_afternoon .
negative	then after they " overbooked " the flight , they asked if we could move to leaving monday_night .
negative	when we changed to this monday_night flight , we were set to return early saturday_morning .
negative	this led us to lose at_least 00_hours of our_honeymoon .
negative	then , there was a problem with the weather , and we were stuck in atlanta monday_night .
negative	we didn_'_t arrive at our hotel location until tuesday_afternoon after we had to spend our money and time on a new plane_ticket and hotel in atlanta .
negative	this meant we lost a night we paid for at our hotel .
negative	when asked about a refund , priceline told us that our vacation package could not be refunded or changed , even_though we didn_'_t get what we paid for .
negative	when we finally arrived in the florida keys , we were placed in a filthy room with an " ocean front view ."
negative	who knew there were forests in the ocean !
negative	we complained multiple_times to the hotel as well as priceline .
negative	each time we called , we go the same script - like response telling us that our vacation package was " non_- changeable " and " non_- refundable ."
negative	we spent roughly 00_hours of our_honeymoon on the phone with over a dozen priceline agents , all of whom could frankly careless about our situation .
negative	it took threatening legal_action to get any kind of response , and even then , there was nothing accomplished except the customer_service representatives suggesting we " write to their headquarters ."
negative	their customer_service was atrocious to say the least , and neither my husband , nor i have ever_experienced such apathy towards customers .
negative	stay away from priceline at all costs !
negative	you get what you pay for , and it '_s much_better to fork over the extra money to avoid dealing_with priceline and their associates .
negative	the customer_service sucks !
negative	i waited 00_minutes for them to answer my call .
negative	i ordered this morning ( 0am ) and when i called to have it canceled ( 00am ), customer_service said they cant cancel it .
negative	omg wtf !
negative	the hotel we booked through this site was one of the worst we have ever stayed in .
negative	it was totally misrepresented by this site .
negative	i began my search for glasses because my old pair were ugly and nearly broken .
negative	i had a very specific and designer frame in mind , one my local optomotrist doesn_'_t carry , so i began to search online .
negative	i really did my homework , and i checked with several sites and examined non_- party reviews .
negative	frames_direct seemed to be overwhelmingly the most cost - effective and convenient choice ; i never saw one absolute negative_review .
negative	so i bought the glasses .
negative	i should have seen the issues from the beginning .
negative	when you place the order it states they '_ll contact you about the prescription lenses .
negative	i waited a week and heard_nothing , so i got on the site myself and realized i could upload it myself , so i did and ignored the feeling i was wasting my time .
negative	i week_later i '_ve heard_nothing , although i checked my order status regularly , and i finally see my frames are on back order .
negative	no one notified me of this .
negative	by that time my glasses should have been delivered .
negative	so i sent and email to customer_service .
negative	they sent me a canned email in response which in no way addressed my concerns .
negative	two_days_later , i saw my status had changed to cancelled .
negative	strange , i didn_'_t cancel it .
negative	apparently the way this company works is to absolutely ignore customers with orders that are out of the ordinary in any way .
negative	you are a small , unimportant fry in relation to their grand scheme .
negative	so if you value your money , your time , or just feel you deserve to feel the companies you use value your service , i suggest you buy your frames elsewhere .
negative	i was unable to take my business trip booked through_travelocity because several hours prior to my air departure , my husband was involved in a serious auto accident .
negative	i immediately called travelocity and was no told " no problem ".
negative	airfare would be a credit require to be used within a year .
negative	hotel cancelation ( for two_nights ) - they would get back to me .
negative	this is was two day trip wiht a specific meeting agenda - not a trip that i could postpone travel and go several days_later .
negative	i had all necessary documentation : police report , emergency room , doctors , etc .
negative	travelocity rep said it wasn_'_t needed .
negative	several phone_calls later - long_story short :
negative	it is a huge waste of my time to speak with reps in india that couldn_'_t understand me nor i them .
negative	asking to speak with a supervisor stateside is a long process that requires repeating entire story numerous_times after a thirty minute wait to actually speak with someone .
negative	no one from travelocity called me back regarding hotel credit and our company had to pay the two_nights despite my having all necessary documentation about the accident and hospital .
negative	when i attempted to use the air credit for another trip , i was told that i had to pay a $_000 penalty fee in order to use a $_000 credit .
negative	summary : i will not use travelocity again for any travel - business or personal .
negative	they have lost my business .
negative	poor customer_service all around .
negative	i wonder does travelocity refund for death ?
negative	is the travelor expected to travel even if a family_member ; husband , parent or child is injured , ill or hospitalized with various supporting documentation for proof ?
negative	these are judgement calls that senior managers and leadership positions should be making if customer_service is a focal_point in your business infrastructure .
negative	der blumenstrauss den ich bestellet habe wurde nicht geliefert .
negative	stattdessen wurden die anderen blumen zugestellt .
negative	found this company easy to use with no_hidden_charges when u pay next time u book flights i would tell you to use them until
negative	i checked my credit_card statement and found an extra $_00 . 00 charge then tried all day to ring the australian phone_number to ask why and no answer had to leave a message for them to ring back tried over and over and never got an answer or a return call i would like my money returned and a phone_call with an_apology will i get it ???????
negative	if i do i will change my view until then
negative	no it isn_'_t you have taken $ 0000 . 00 out of my account and that isn_'_t my ticketed price also i have had my phone on all day and received lots of calls but none from you i have also tried to ring today and got your answering_machine again and again and have had no reply i also started a ticket ???
negative	and that hasn_'_t helped either
negative	both my family and i booked with alpharooms in the past and were happy with them but i won_'_t be booking with them again !
negative	i booked the meyrick in galway for saturday_night but i got sick last monday and under doctors orders i was unable to travel ! alpharooms could not refund my money as it was too close to the date .
negative	i was disappointed in this as i wasn_'_t cancelling because i changed my mind i was too sick to go !
negative	i rang the meyrick directly and they kindly offered to change the date for no extra_cost to any other date that would suit .
negative	they asked me to get alpharooms to email the changed date to them .
negative	i rang alpharooms and they said they would look into it .
negative	i then got an_email that said it would cost me 00 sterling to change the date .
negative	i replied saying that i thought this was very steep as it was over 00_% of the room price ! i have got no reply .
negative	after several happy bookings my family and i are disgusted that they wouldn_'_t change a booking when number one the hotel were happy to do it and number two under doctors orders i was not allowed to travel .
negative	i also think they should have replied to my email .
negative	i am very disappointed and annoyed at the service so i won_'_t be using this website again
negative	ordered a bbq as a father '_s day gift .
negative	garden_xl stated next_day delivery .
negative	0 days_later i received an_email_saying it would be delivered in 00 days .
negative	i phoned them 00 days_later ( after it still hadn_'_t been delivered ) to be told it would be another 0_weeks .
negative	i was starting to think the business was going bust at this point !
negative	!
negative	called after 0_weeks where the customers services person said it was not due for delivery at all - the order was stuck in some_sort of delivery purgatory .
negative	i had asked for a manager to call me to explain what had happened , but no one did and no has since called to apologise .
negative	will not use this company again .
negative	after ordering the blue baby '_s first christmas photo orniment
negative	i was sent a pink one
negative	i checked my order and it was the blue one i ordered
negative	so it will be getting sent back this week
negative	no instant delivery , autokey system is bad .
negative	" in stock " means " we might have it , but it '_s not for sure ".
negative	i am very dissapointed .
negative	my husband and i ordered passports 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	i have received mine but he still_hasn_'_t received his .
negative	it has_been 00days !!!
negative	!
negative	we are very unsatisfied with the
negative	service we received when calling to get answers on why he hasn_'_t received his .
negative	very unorganized and no one could
negative	really give any clear answers .
negative	it was horrible experience .
negative	i have never got reimbursed from a night in a hotel that was booked on mistake from travelocity .
negative	i have called 0 times and they keep saying its " being_processed "
negative	i will never use ship_sticks again
negative	i placed an order with preciouslittleone a couple of weeks_ago and when the items arrived i was thrilled , i had bought cellular blankets and they were the softest nicest looking blankets i had ever_seen / felt ,.
negative	i decided to make another order for 0 packs of cot_bed sheets in the same make and when they arrived i opened one packet and they were lovely and i was pleased with my purchase but when i opened to second packet , the sheets had light brown stains all over them !
negative	i was very unhappy with this as you can imagine but what makes it '_s worse is that i have planned to buy my cot_bed , parasol and more cellular blankets from this website and my baby is due in 0_weeks so my plans are ruined and now i will have to find my items elsewhere .
negative	i was under the impression that my reservation would be able to be cancelled for free and now i am stuck paying hundreds of dollars for a reservation i cannot use !
negative	do not initial anything .
negative	priceline customer_service is very unhelpful .
negative	do not use priceline .
negative	i have had much_better experiences with kayak !
negative	altiuscart . com does not screen sellers : rainbow electronics and communications limited .
negative	after four different ship dates and a bogus tracking_number , i was sent the following email : " i will like you to know that there is a little problem with your package as it has_been held by custom demanding for for custom fees which is $_000 and if this fees is not paid they will not be releasing the package for delivery to your door_step ."
negative	i requested a refund ... " your order have been shipped out and it is already in usa there is no way you can get a refund if the package is not delivered to you .
negative	you can only get a refund if the product delivered to you is not working fine or if you are not satisfied with the product ."
negative	this is the worst delivery carrier out there !
negative	i advise any businesses looking for a delivery comapny to stay well away form yodel , your custermers will never receive their parcels .
negative	we stayed in all day , regulary cheacking the tracking status ; at 0 :_00am the parcal left the local depot which is less_than 0 miles_away , then at 0 :_00pm this evening the tracking status said that the parcal had been delivered at 0 :_00pm , yet we haven_'_t received anything !
negative	we can '_t contact yodel , the phone_number on there website is not a real number , there live_chat service is closed ( even_though it is suppose to be open until 0 :_00pm !)
negative	we are absolutely furious with yodel !!
negative	!
negative	i received an outdated $_00 bag of prescription science_diet cat !
negative	why would you sell me an expensive bag of food that has already expired ?
negative	i searched the internet for a restaurant gift_card and your company came up .
negative	after my purchase , i found that you were not affiliated with that restaurant at all .
negative	i called the restaurant and they were not happy that their name was connected to your website .
negative	i then cancelled the transaction with you and it took days for the credit to appear in my account .
negative	bad business_practices , shame on you .
negative	i will neve use a drive up storage_unit again was in unit less then a month mice droppings everywhere no food was stored in unit but mice were in a box with shoes spider nest everywhere one cooler had over 00 nests on it had unit during the moth of may
negative	very poor company .
negative	agoda sent a confirming e_- mail to me stating a hotel voucher would be sent within an_hour .
negative	no voucher .
negative	after a couple of days , i followed_up .
negative	agoda claims 00 / 0 customer_service and promise a response within 00_hours .
negative	no response .
negative	sent request again .
negative	after five days , received an e_- mail_stating there was no reservation and no room available at the hotel .
negative	offered no assistance or explanation .
negative	meanwhile , one of my fellow_travelers booked a room after i supposedly had a reservation .
negative	this is a terrible company .
negative	see other problems noted in other traveler reviews on websites .
negative	i reserved an outside drive up unit 0x00 and went to see it at lunch today .
negative	it was not an outside unit , and nor was it " drive up ".
negative	it was down two different hallways .
negative	what a waste of my time .
negative	i spent my lunch_hour in this worthless pursuit .
negative	also , i like to speak directly with the management at the location not to a customer_service person at some call_center who has never even seen the storage_facility .
negative	i will make_sure not to ever use selfstorage , com again .
negative	it was a horrible experience .
negative	sylvia never told me that there was an_additional 000 dollar fee for our dog .
negative	when we got to the hotel i got there much earlier because there was an_issue with the address as when when booking so i wanted to make_sure we were at the right one . i went in and at the desk they told me .
negative	i immediately canceled my reservation at 000 and called and canceled with your reservation_counter . had to go find another hotel that was pet friendly .
negative	and they had my name wrong it '_s pina not tina i told her a number of times and still it '_s wrong .
negative	i booked a hotel at_0am for immediate stay , travelocity booked it for that night .
negative	when confronted couldn_'_t get a supervisor to call me back and travelocity charged me for a night i didn_'_t stay and refused to reimburse_me .
negative	will never use their services again !
negative	the subject says it all .
negative	i have never had such unsatisfactory service as this company provides .
negative	i placed my order on oct . 00 and didn_'_t receive until nov 00 .
negative	it was for 0 parts and one was the incorrect part sent in the correct box .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_support on nov 00 ( since there is no contact number ) and it took until nov 00 to receive a vague reply asking for the order number and part number even_though i had sent that in the original email .
negative	i sent the reply answer on nov 00 and this time i got another vague reply in two_days on nov 00 saying my order was setup for return , that " you will receive an_rma e_- mail in approximately 00 - 00_hours ".
negative	for all the parts or just the one ???
negative	am i supposed to pay shipping for them shipping the incorrect part .
negative	i replied on nov 00 asking this .
negative	once again two_days_later on nov 00 i get a short vague response " only the incorrect part ".
negative	now i have sent another email_asking why i should have to pay return .
negative	it '_ll just be easier to dispute the charges with my bank .
negative	be warned , don_'_t buy from this company !!!!
negative	!
negative	i live all the way in california .
negative	instead of me ordering from amazon i said let_me try car part king .
negative	what the heck did i do that for .
negative	i was waiting for this part to come so i can get my car fixed well i got
negative	a rotor and drum instead of a hub and bearing , you go figure how you get those parts mixed up .
negative	is my car fixed no .
negative	i recently ordered a pair of shoes and a dress .
negative	the shoes came in but i never received the dress .
negative	i called customer_service and reported my problem .
negative	the lady i talked on the phone with said she can '_t give me my money and said she can give me store credit for the dress .
negative	still have not gotten any store credit and it '_s been over 0 days !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i paid_extra for anti_- reflective lenses , which they never put on .
negative	i called to have it fixed .
negative	their customer_service was incompetent , and followed_up my phone_call with an e_- mail asking if i wanted it fixed , and stated they wouldn_'_t start the new pair till i replied ?!
negative	isn_'_t that why i called in the first place ??
negative	that just lost more time in getting what i paid for made and shipped to me .
negative	then they threatened to charge my credit_card for the new pair when they failed to e_- mail over the return packing_slip so i could ship it off !!
negative	this was was by_far one of my worst online experiences .
negative	i will never attempt to buy glasses online again !!
negative	!
negative	i made my hotel reservation that afternoon .
negative	i arrived at the hotel by 0 : 00_pm and the front_desk told me they did not have my reservation .
negative	i checked my email and tried to pull up the voucher but what i got was a page that told me my information was moved or deleted .
negative	i then called both of the phone numbers associated with the company .
negative	00_minutes on hold !
negative	no one ever answered !
negative	they charged my card but never gave_me the reservation .
negative	i wound_up paying the walk in rate at the hotel as i was standing there with my crying 0 year_old who was absolutely finished with being in the car .
negative	the next_day i see a confirmation_email ( time stamp 0 : 00 am !!!!
negative	) sorry bookit . com , too late !
negative	i am disputing the charge with my cc company and telling all of my friends to use a reputable , better organized online service .
negative	i booked 0 rooms at a hotel “ naries namakwa retreat , springbok , south - africa through “ easy to book ” and cancelled it the very next_day .
negative	according to “ easy to book ” i was intitled to a full_refund .
negative	i have never received a refund until this day .
negative	i got screwed out of $_000 . 00 by “ easy to book ”.
negative	also , they don_’ t return your e_- mails or phone_calls .
negative	tel
negative	i tried to order twice from this site .
negative	both_times the racket i ordered was not in stock an order was cancelled .
negative	the second time money was taken from my visa and my order was never despatched .
negative	still not resolved
negative	i planned a trip including hotel , car_rental and airfare .
negative	when i arrived the i was denied the car_rental , therefore i was forced to use a different provider and was charged $_000 . 00 for a car_rental .
negative	this really imposed on my trip , i am very disappointed and don_'_t planonusing travelocity again .
negative	i wish i could say that this was the best fine in a long while , but it '_s not .
negative	like my father in law used to say , " a bargain is not bargain ".
negative	they are a complete_waste as they do not fit the machine as_promised .
negative	this experience with this reservation company is the worst_experience i have ever_encountered .
negative	liars . cheats , and just down right stupid people are at these phone numbers .
negative	i can '_t imagine a company hiring these operators .
negative	on the phone two hours to get a reservation , and this nit wit still couldn_'_t get it right .
negative	these people and company should be closed down .
negative	please see statement above regarding my purchase .
negative	impossible to phone and speak directly with a human_being - this has caused me twice very frustrating problems and frustrating time .
negative	their automating service is also very limited as they do not for see individual issues and one can get stuck and be unable to use it because the system asks you for several reference numbers and not all are provided ( e . g .
negative	card number might have not been posted as yet ).
negative	the telephone system offers you to select a given option if you wish the item to be delivered at a specific date / time .
negative	before asking you to proceed with this option it tells you there is a charge for this service , but does not tell you how much .
negative	after loosing over an_hour looking for a tel number which could allow me to speak to one of their employees , and having tried in vane using their telephone and computer automated_system , i became hugely frustrated as this was preventing me from doing my own work and i was pretty busy on that day .
negative	as frustrated as i was i sent them a complaint via_email explaining the problems i had had , i received no reply on that day .
negative	on the following_day i received a very short acknowledgement that my shipment had reached me .
negative	do they know that because i had been unable to reach them on the previous delivery day and because the item was urgent i had to make all sort of arrangements and had to inconvenience several people so that i could stay in for that specific hour they had set the delivery service at ?
negative	a simple phone_call with one of their employees could have resulted in a very satisfied customer .
negative	i had a similar experience with them last_year when they forgot to write a reference_number on the card they posted to me and i had no way to follow_up their pc or tel automated_system - this is for sure the most frustrating company i have had to deal with .
negative	they save_money putting an automating service but how many customers will this cost them ?
negative	what image and reputation are they building for themselves ?
negative	the car_hire company did not turn up or answer our calls so we did not get a car at all .
negative	i appreciate this in itself is not rental_cars ' fault , however , they have not responded to me at all after 0 attempts to register my complaint by phone and email .
negative	this company cannot take your money and accept no responsibility for the fact that a service was not provided .
negative	i am now £_000 down and the experience spoiled the start to our holiday .
negative	let '_s see if we get a response now , shameful customer_service !
negative	i would not use your services again .
negative	your database didn_'_t even recognize my vin number as a valid bmw number .
negative	my work had to be delayed because the complete order wasn_'_t shipped in a timely_manner .
negative	the packaging was poorly done , i '_m surprised it made it without the box bursting open .
negative	i am done with ebay and paypal .
negative	i haven_'_t sold anything via ebay ( and paypal for probably a year ).
negative	used to do it quite frequently .
negative	i used to enjoy it and never_experienced any_problems .
negative	i wanted to have a little extra_cash for christmas , so sold some perfume via ebay ( as i have done many_times before ).
negative	offered free_shipping to drive up my sales .
negative	sold one for $_00 . 00 and one for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i had numerous problems because my ebay and paypal weren_'_t linked .
negative	got that taken_care of .
negative	got an_email that i needed to ship items .
negative	ebay stated that payment was processing .
negative	i read that monies were completed on the buyer end and it was okay to ship .
negative	i also read that if shipping done through ebay / paypal , it would come out of funds paid from sale and at a discount .
negative	long_story short , i got an_email today that my bank was rejecting attempts from paypal to withdraw funds for the shipping .
negative	i called , spoke to someone with limited command of english , and i am to understand that money will be available up to 00 days from date payment cleared .
negative	fees from ebay , fees from paypal , $_00 . 00 via_paypal for shipping , payment cleared , but i won_'_t get my money til god_knows when .
negative	i '_m pissed .
negative	i feel_like i got screwed by ebay and paypal and i won_'_t use them again .
negative	they can hold their customers money for up to 00 days ( which has cleared and is in their possession ).
negative	i guess you hold all customers funds long enough , it can add up to a pretty penny in interest .
negative	it '_s crooked , it '_s wrong and i don_'_t have to do_business with them anymore and i won_'_t .
negative	it was good while it lasted , but it ain '_t good anymore .
negative	it stinks !
negative	all disgusting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	could not digest anything do not buy !
negative	i cannot_believe a ten minute call , at my expense , to change my booking can warrant a £_00 fee .
negative	i will not be booking through your company again , and as i travel frequently the uk and my family and friends do the same from the ukl to france you have lost a valuable customer .
negative	i was lied to by reservation_counter when i made a reservation .
negative	when i called to cancel , the person i spoke with was extremely_rude , sarcastic , and condescending .
negative	i will never use this site to book my hotels and will tell_everyone i know to not use this site .
negative	after_reading several bad_reviews on different websites i thought i ' d give it a go any way as i , like many , need to spread out the costs of christmas and several birthdays all coming together .
negative	i was approved for the repayment scheme and so sat back and waited thinking i ' d managed to get all my shopping done .
negative	.
negative	0_weeks_later i contacted isme to see what was happening with my order to be told that no confirmation had come through for my order and that i should wait to see what happened .
negative	wait !
negative	how long !!
negative	it was a general letter blaming other departments and i am not impressed .
negative	where did i put the watchdog email address ?
negative	i would not recommend this company for any reason .
negative	i bought a costume for my son that is too small and they will not even exchange it for me or give a refund .
negative	the return_policy states that sale items aren_'_t refunded but that isn_'_t clear until after you purchase .
negative	i called to see what could be done and they wouldn_'_t help at all so i wasted my money and will never use them again .
negative	my husband and i decided to book a hotel a few_days ago .
negative	i could tell that i was talking to a foreign call_center ..
negative	i think india . during booking on phone , the lady said that if i needed to cancel my reservation to do so before july 0 , 0000 ( she meant aug 0 .. july 0 has obviously passed this was know the 0rd time i corrected her on the date ) if i canceled before aug0 , there would be no penalty .
negative	well , the next_day my daughter caught a nasty bug .. so we decided to cancel our reservation .
negative	when i called to cancel , i got a man this time but seems from same out of country .
negative	he put me on hold and said that he was going to call the hotel .
negative	he came back on the phone , and said that the hotel was not answering and to try and call back .
negative	he did say that the hotels policy is that they can cancel without_penalty if the cancellation is due to a medical condition or something unforeseen .
negative	so i thought well .. great !
negative	well , i called back on monday ( today ) to cancel , since he couldn_'_t get a hold of the hotel manager yesterday .
negative	i told the lady that i had called a day prior to cancel , and explained the above to her .
negative	she put me on hold to call the hotel .
negative	she came back on after several minutes , and said that the hotel could not cancel because i would have had to call before july 0 , 0000 .
negative	i corrected this lady too .. we are passed july 0 ... do you mean aug 0 ?
negative	she said .. oh sorry ..
negative	i mean aug 0 .
negative	i said , it '_s july_00th , not passed the 0rd yet .
negative	she said , yes i know .. but you needed to cancel before 0 days of your check in time ..
negative	i said .. i am calling 0 days before not on the 0th day !
negative	i don_'_t understand what the problem is .
negative	i was told when i made my reservation that i would have to call and cancel before aug 0 to avoid any penalties .. she said " who told you that " i said your call_center told me that !
negative	i have it written down as i was being given the information !
negative	she said that the hotel could not cancel , and the the money already charged on my card is non_refundable .
negative	i was furious !
negative	i told the lady ..
negative	i am going to call the hotel myself .
negative	i called the hotel , and i was friendly and courteous .. and i told the lady the situation .. that i needed to cancel due to my daughters illness , and she said that i would need to cancel through_expedia , and that the money was non_refundable .
negative	i told her that no where on their website or expedia '_s , or the person taking my reservation tell me there was a non_refundable fee .
negative	i was told there would be no penalty , and especially_since this was an unforeseen illness .
negative	she said that i would have to take it up with expedia .
negative	so i thought to myself .. no ..
negative	i am going to take it up with my bank .. stop the transaction .
negative	luckily .. my bank is able to kick out the transaction as soon as it goes into " processing " thank_god !
negative	so now i am going to call expedia back and make_sure they cancel my reservation ..
negative	i don_'_t even want to discuss money .. that is already resolved .
negative	they are not going to get one dime from me not ever .
negative	do not ever book with expedia .
negative	a
negative	this company is a joke !
negative	everything from online to customer_service !
negative	had a very expensive package arriving .
negative	tracked the package online to see that it would be delivered while i was not home .
negative	thought it very convenient that for $ 0 they would give me the option to chose a delivery time !
negative	awesome right ..... no !!!!!
negative	sat at home between the 0 hour delivery window .... for nothing !
negative	package never arrived .
negative	so i called customer_service , where they told me that they were not able to deliver during that time because they didn_'_t have anyone available to deliver !
negative	what ?!?!
negative	are you a delivery company ?
negative	and did you not just give me that option online ?
negative	idiots !
negative	anyway ..... she continues to tell me not to worry that they will deliver the following_morning ( saturday ).
negative	i ask her if that is really the case with a sturdy delivery , and she guarantees it will be here between 00am - 00pm .
negative	i wait .... and wait .... once again ... nothing !
negative	call customer_service again only to hear that the package was never put on the truck for delivery ( no one knows why ), and that it won_'_t be delivered till tuesday between 0pm - 0pm !
negative	really ?!!!!
negative	i just want to scream !
negative	what a joke , and a run_around !
negative	at this point i am so frustrated that i say i want a refund for the $ 0 dollars i paid in order to make a request , that obviously never happened !
negative	he says he can '_t help me and gives me the number to billing .
negative	i call billing .... sit on the phone on hold for 00_minutes .... explain my whole situation again ..... only to be told that they can '_t help me , that i have to request the refund online !!!
negative	frustrated , i follow the instructions online !
negative	fill_out the whole stupid form ..... only to be told ....." due to service failure - sorry , we are currently unable to process your request .
negative	please try again later "!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	so basically every_aspect of this company sucks !!!
negative	their online that gave_me the option to make a request that was obviously not available .
negative	their shipping crew who are not available to make a delivery when they said they would .
negative	their warehouse crew who cannot seem to put a package in the truck that is suppose to be delivered .
negative	their customer_service who a . hardly understood or spoke_english , b . who cannot tell me the truth about my package , c . who cannot process a refund !
negative	and finally their online customer_service who apparently are a " service failure "..... but that i knew ... before they even told me !!!!
negative	!
negative	excellent chair and table , appalling customer_service !
negative	i bought a swimsuit from this company a few_months_ago and let_me tell you it was my first buy and my last !!!.
negative	i payed like 00 dollars plus shipping which tells that you will receive it in a week and you get it like 0 months later ....
negative	i dont_know how many_times i called this company and the same girl always answered me and she treated me like if i was trash she yelled at me , lied to me and treated me the worst way anyone has treated me before , once i got mad and told her to go f *** herself and that stupid company she worked for because this stupid company wouldnt give me a tracking_number neither would tell me where my package was ... first they told me it was in backorder .. and then they kept on lying saying they will return my calls i was so sad becuase i actually didnt even get to put the swimsuit on the days that i went to vacation .... ladies if you are thinking of buying from this site dont do it unless you want trouble trust me this site has worst costumer_service and they lie constantly .....
negative	they play with people '_s money and that isnt fair ...
negative	they dont even know how to run business becuase if they did things like they are suppoused to they will get lotsss of buyers ..
negative	but like i said they play with your money and im not the only one that says it ... dont buy from here ever ... buy somewhere_else maybe you wont get clothes so cheap but you will receive them on time and how you want them ... at the end i did receive the swimsuit but 0 months later i didnt even wanted it anymore but w . e i decided not to return it because it would be more trouble ....
negative	not buying from here again , every time has_been a fail .
negative	it took a very long time to receive my glasses , but i thought for the price it would be worth it .
negative	when i received my glasses i couldn_'_t see out of them at all .
negative	they were not my prescription .
negative	i '_ve been trying to contact someone to return them and have had no luck .
negative	i had to get another pair ( using the same prescription ) at another location for the same price and love my new glasses .
negative	just wish i could get my money back .
negative	part ordered was wrong part , paid shipping to receive it and to return it .
negative	will have to wait 00 days for credit .
negative	never have this problem when i go to local parts store .
negative	i will never make this mistake again .
negative	i booked a room and told them i would use another credit_card or pay cash when we got there and it was already charged to my card when we checked in .
negative	very decietful
negative	was a 0st time buyer ... but did not allow me to get 0st time buyers discount ($_00 . 00 ) or free_shipping ($ 0 . 00 ) because i was using a groupon ...( like a gift_card ).
negative	all they offered me was a refund of the $ 0 . 00 shipping ).
negative	what about my $_00 . 00 ?
negative	i was a 0st time customer !
negative	then when my things arrived ... they packed boxed cat_litter with food .
negative	litter came out of corners and edges of its container and was all over in the box .
negative	this made my pet_food ... which were in bags ... smell like scented cat_litter .
negative	very dissatisfied with this company .
negative	i will not use again .
negative	i booked with flighthub because they had a seat available that i liked .
negative	unbeknownst to me , that seat was a handicap designated seat that flighthub was not authorized to sell .
negative	only jetblue could assign that seat !!!!
negative	very deceiving !!
negative	!
negative	i had a most unpleasant experience .
negative	i booked a flt but unfortunately did not view the sent itenirary until a day or two before my flight and to my dismay , it was not the time i had selected .
negative	i wasted more than two hrs being put on hold and then being disconnected without_any positive results .
negative	just once , since it was an_emergency , the mistake could have been corrected and waiving the fee .
negative	my grandmother died at about the time i was arriving on the later flight .
negative	despite their service " guarantee " of delivering tickets of the same quality or better in case of ticket order problems , not only did they not give me the tickets i paid for 0 months in advance , but they just refunded my money 00_hours prior to the concert date without previous notice !
negative	and worse even , despite my repeated explanation of how these tickets were a christmas_present for my 0 year_old daughter and them still having tickets offered for sale on their website , they did not deliver on their guarantee .
negative	worse experience ever .
negative	do not recommend !!
negative	!
negative	i have a prescription off plus 0 , they claimed that they could make my glasses and at almost_half off the high_street price ... however after 0_weeks of contacting them asking for an update they eventually informed me that they cannot make my glasses to the spec they claimed !
negative	also i have not received an_email where they answer a question .. they brush you off and then thank_you for using their service ( never again )
negative	lastly when i agreed to buy just the frames , they sent me an invoice stating that the frames were £_00 dearer then stated on their web_site !
negative	and they still have not refunded the £_000 they still owe me .... i am very disappointed as i can not see without glasses .
negative	avoid beware do not use !!!!
negative	!
negative	my phone did not pass and they wouldn_'_t return it , i could have used it as a camera / ipod !
negative	it was a galaxy_s0 so now im out of pocket !!!
negative	mazuma_mobile were amazing .
negative	i will never use envirofone again !
negative	!
negative	have been trying to get these for 0_weeks !
negative	daughter graduates saturday ... called monday and said they should be shipped that day ... however , these were not shipped thursday with 0 - 0 day delivery and i informed them monday i need them no later than saturday :(.
negative	grrr
negative	we drove up to hotel and what appeared to be ladies of the night standing off to the side .
negative	while we were sitting in our car we watched cars pull on and things being handed in windows and then cars pulled out .
negative	the hotel is not in a very good area .
negative	we were afraid to stay there or the family to be around this .
negative	we left quickly
negative	never received cleanser , will not reply to my e_- mails and never answer the phone , i have had to raise a claim with pay - pal .
negative	will never use again .
negative	i purchased a part from december_00th 0000 and it is now january 0th 0000 still_haven_'_t receive my part yet .
negative	aggravating , pissed what '_s taking so long
negative	if i could give them zero_stars i would .
negative	i ordered an item on nov . 00 and was told it would arrive in 00 days .
negative	on nov . 00 i received an_email_saying that it had just been shipped from australia ( i live in the u . s .).
negative	i got another email assuring me it would arrive by dec . 00 -- it '_s still not here .
negative	i am hoping it will arrive by christmas since it was supposed to be a gift .
negative	they told me it was coming via_ups but supplied no tracking_number so i can '_t even find out where it is .
negative	either they are dishonest or tremendously disorganized - either way a bad choice for consumers .
negative	i ordered 0 mega bulb suspension lamps on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i received both lamps on 00 / 00 / 00 , yes 00 months later .
negative	after opening , i discovered one of the lamps shattered during transportation .
negative	immediately , i sent an_email to request a replacement since there is not an english_speaking option on the international number .
negative	after about 00 emails over the course of another 0 months , i finally received my replacement lamp on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	yes , this company did sent a replacement however the process in order for me to receive a new product like i paid for took an extensive amount of time and frustration .
negative	i will never order from this vendor again .
negative	i ordered parts the first time i will take the blame for the wrong part .
negative	so instead of sending it back i planned on just eating the cost .
negative	i took my time made sure it was the correct_part and ordered once again .
negative	when it came surprise it was the wrong thing .
negative	the numbers don_'_t even match to the part i ordered .
negative	i filled out the customer number never got an answer .
negative	so i went directly to gm where i should have gone first .
negative	so please learn from my mistake .
negative	never i mean never use this company !
negative	i bought a copy of black_ops 0 via_paypal ( credcard backup ) and it was cleared instantly out of my account .
negative	i waited a day and ended_up having to buy 0 more copies ( they were prizes on my youtube ) as my first still was listed as " awaiting payment "
negative	another day goes past and i put in a support_ticket which took 0 day alone to get an " auto response " asking me to give them my order number and email which i had already done the moment i opened a ticket .
negative	0 more days go past and i send them a furious reply , and i finally get my game .
negative	terrible service , have been using cjs for nearly a year , i will not be using them anymore .
negative	awful customer_service and worst_experience ever .
negative	i would not recommend this company
negative	don_'_t bother with the express terminal service - they don_'_t deliver .
negative	left us at airport with three kids at 0 am and when the bus finally got us there were three seats for four of us .
negative	claimed they were understaffed but when we arrived there were three office workers - as well as bus drivers and parking_lot staff .
negative	obviously the management feels they are too superior to help with actual labor and drive a car over to the terminal .
negative	too bad , there seems to be lots of competition .
negative	next time we will use " parking_spot " - they had a strong presence .
negative	i ordered a pair of white and pink mizuno trainers last_week , they arrived on the date that they were suppose to friday 00th , however when they arrived they were the completely wrong ones , they were iluminous pink green and pink ( unwearable ) as i live in the country it is a big hassle to actually return products so i had to make a special journey out just to take these to the nearest collect shop .
negative	i have since had no feedback and no replacement trainers .
negative	very unhappy with the service
negative	the hotel that we booked in tifton ga was supposed to be a smoking_room with a king_bed however when we arrived we had no choice except to be put in a non_smoking_room with double_beds on our_honeymoon no less .
negative	the pillows were hard and pancake flat .
negative	the towels were the size of a standard pillow_case and when i asked for an extra the manager was rude !
negative	the door lock was falling_off the wall as well as the tub knobs and as if that wasnt crappy enough there was zero hot_water .
negative	it took over a week just to get back $_00 of $_00 . 00 there was no fridge no microwave no bible and no phone book .
negative	it was not at all what we booked .
negative	i have not received my order and have emailed pure_health and got no response back so i had to file in the resolution center and still have not heard from you .
negative	mary
negative	i am very unhappy with this site as i did not receive my order wouldn_'_t use this site again
negative	i would never shop at superdry ever again
negative	i was told i would get a refund after gc rescue rep called vendor to inquire where electronic gc was used ( in another_state as an in store purchase ).
negative	now i get an_email from gc rescue saying what is the best way to contact you to ' resolve ' this .
negative	it was resolved over a week_ago and i get an_email_saying we need to resolve this ?
negative	what a day , i finally saw the delivery truck at the top of my driveway !
negative	apperently he had driven down once and not knowing if he was in the right place , had returned to the top of the driveway .
negative	on my grass and not the wide driveway .
negative	having not called for directions the day before making the delivery or at_least an_hour or so , which i clearly put phone first !
negative	( he phoned about 0 minutes before coming to my house ) he had to resort to going through my mailbox to see if i lived here .!
negative	i was fortunately at home , but could easily have been out .
negative	not being good at reversing , he decide to back all the way to the main road and asked me to see him out .
negative	i have never had to do this before for anyone standing in a very busy road and dodging traffic .
negative	he said there was not room to turn_around but all other drivers have been able to .
negative	this experience left me with frazzled nerves and ruined my day .
negative	boiler_juice i may not order from you again !
negative	i ordered glasses on the jan . 0 and this is feb 0 , 0000 and no glasses and no correspondence as to the status of my order .
negative	poor customer_service .
negative	we had no_issues with the vehicle - however , the staff in venice at the piazza roma location could use a course in how to handle customers .
negative	they were very nonchalant , and did not offer a map or ask if we needed any assistance with getting outside venice .- we had to ask .
negative	i have used other_vendors and they actually walk you to the car and review things with you - here they pointed to a vehicle up the street and said -" there '_s your car ."
negative	it seemed an impostion to take_care of the rental papers .
negative	just seemed very cold and uncaring .
negative	also , they advised there would be extra_charges but could nto advise what they were for .
negative	( we had added 0 additional drivers but it did not add up to what they advised i would owe ).
negative	i will not suggest or use this service again .
negative	i have purchased 0 times from ebayers who have used my hermes .
negative	item 0 & 0 .
negative	items arrived 0_weeks after arrival_date .
negative	lots of messing_about emailing sellers , asking for tracking codes , and waiting and hanging on to see if they did arrive .
negative	item 0 .
negative	arrived 0_weeks late , ceramics , was completely smashed .
negative	item 0 .
negative	never arrived at all , then the company lied and said that they had delivered so i was not even eligible for a refund .
negative	all in all ...
negative	unreliable , unprofessional and dishonest
negative	the prices are cheap but so are the goods .
negative	it '_s always a gamble as to whether the items will be of a good enough quality .
negative	customer_services operate like a machine not a human_being .
negative	i requested an exchange as the sizes are so small but was completely ignored and was issued a refund , as its my second dissatisfied experience with boohoo i decided i wouldn_'_t bother to reorder .
negative	this was my first order with petflow . com .
negative	i received a box with my partial order .
negative	there was no packing_slip or any indication what was going on with the rest of my order .
negative	finally , a few_days_later i received a 0nd box which again had no packing sheet or any info .
negative	i had ordered 0 dog braid chews and only received one .
negative	not worth the hassle or expense to get my 0nd dog chew .
negative	i will not do_business with this company again .
negative	when i placed my order on 0 / 0 , i upped the delivery option to expedited_shipping ( 0 - 0 business days ).
negative	yesterday was the 0th business day and the items ordered still have not been delivered .
negative	it was not a large order , but i expected much_better service in the delivery of these items .
negative	if my cat likes these items and lives long enough that i need more , i will order through amazon , which has a much_better record of speedy_delivery .
negative	0 month for part to arrive after dozens of phone_calls , then quoted incorrect price , finally part arrived and was wrong part .
negative	i ordered an alternator for my older volvo after previously ordering a much_cheaper part from partsgeek .
negative	( a relay ) the alternator arrived incomplete and with no invoice or shipping information , let_alone any information for making a return or customer_support .
negative	i referred to their website for customer_service and found they have none !
negative	do not ever expect to talk to a live human at this company .
negative	they offer no phone_number or address to contact and instead work through a series of " take a number " and universal emails that contain no real information .
negative	i don_'_t trust this company enough to send the part back and hope for a refund ( there instructions say to wait up to 00 days and then contact them with question for return refunds .... how the hell are we supposed to contact you jerks !?)
negative	don_'_t waste you money with the no service sneaky company .
negative	it sucks i guess because it does not show the us money wise how you are going to charge their credit_cards !
negative	very unhappy with the fact that my never got processed on your end after showing it on my end do to a computer issue
negative	my tea plants did arrive promptly but were tiny with a few branches or even just one branch with less_than a dozen leaves , huge disappointment , will not order from bb again -- $_00 for a tiny plant ?
negative	and you have inundated my emails and web interface with your ceaseless advertising .
negative	i feel_like i am being stalked , not being thanked for being a customer .
negative	bad_experience .
negative	this was my first experience booking with travelocity , and i can '_t say that i '_ll be a returning customer .
negative	when i submitted my reservation it popped back saying the price had increased and asked if i wanted to proceed .
negative	i did , so i clicked the button .
negative	there was a glitch in their system and instead of authorizing the charge twice ($ 0 charge to see if there is sufficient funds in the account ), they fully charged me twice .
negative	each charge was around $ 0 , 000 .
negative	multiple phone_calls were made each day , and it took nearly a week to to get my money back .
negative	during one of the last phone_calls i made , the customer_service representative was extremely_rude and told me it was my fault i was charged twice .
negative	i called to make a complaint about my experience , and all they could offer was a $_00 voucher for my next booking .
negative	it seemed a worthless exchange considering all the trouble i had experienced .
negative	purchased a book , payment cleared , then several days_later , i '_m told the book wasn_'_t even available for purchase .
negative	i was refunded .
negative	but if the book was unavailable , it should not have been listed for purchase in the first place .
negative	my order was two_weeks late , and i sent them back .
negative	that was months_ago , i have tried to call and email , but i still havent got my money back .
negative	dont order from this webbsite .
negative	!
negative	ordered all replacement cartridges , one totally brand_new , will not work
negative	same as above .
negative	it is fraudulent
negative	on 00 :_00am , monday , june 00 , 0000 my new husband and i arrived at the albq .
negative	airport to travel to madrid , spain .
negative	upon trying to check in , we were told our tickets were invalid because we would arrive later than our connecting_flight left .
negative	we called flight_hub and iberia multiple_times , each of which said it was the other '_s fault .
negative	the story as i understand it , flight was changed , so we were changed to the 0am flight , but never notified .
negative	iberia said it alerted flight_hub , but flight_hub never alerted us and even while dealing_with agent on phone , our reservation still showed we were supposed to take off at 00 :_00pm from abq .
negative	an agent , edwin , apologized and tried to get us a new flight .
negative	first saying he would try for the next_day , then monday_night , then said he needed a supervisor '_s help and he ' d call within a couple hours .
negative	four hours_later , he still hadn_'_t called , so we called back .
negative	we went to bed without it being resolved .
negative	the next ( tuesday ) morning , while on hold , a new reservation email for wednesday popped_up .
negative	it said to confirm with the airline , so we called iberia , they confirmed , then called flight_hub and confirmed again .
negative	the next_day ..... no reservation with american .
negative	we had no reservation number for them .
negative	we had a flight from chicago to madrid and back , but no domestic flights to get us to and from chicago .
negative	after over two hours talking to iberia , the american_airlines counter , flight_hub , and american reservations line , we had missed our flight and had the flight to madrid canceled due to " no show ".
negative	back and forth , mostly on hold for another 0 . 0 hrs , elijah came on and said all he could offer was to refund the tickets and then we could make new reservations .
negative	we were refunded the cost of the original ticket , but the fact we lost four days of our_honeymoon , lost hotel reservations , so much added frustration , two_days spent in the airport was never addressed .
negative	do not use flight_hub !!!
negative	!
negative	i booked my hotel through priceline for 0 nights , to realize after the fact that the hotel website advertised the room for 00 $ less_than priceline .
negative	i called priceline the agent i spoke to after " searching " for the hotel website for 00_min told me ok your all set .
negative	had to call for the second time the agent says you have to fax us the receipts .
negative	i did then i got an_email_saying i need a folio ok that '_s great but i don_'_t have it because i should of been told by the first agent what i needed in order to get my refund to begin with !
negative	!
negative	the third time i call the agent goes well i '_m telling you now what you need .
negative	moral of the story the worse experience i will never use priceline they are not the cheapest !!!
negative	i didn_'_t even_bother getting my refund all the hassle is not worth 00 $
negative	i ordered a bouquet of stargazer lilies called " lilly blush " for a friend in germany who just suffered the death of her spouse .
negative	the description is below .
negative	" this modern , sweet - smelling , and passionate bouquet makes for a surprising delight .
negative	more about this bouquet :
negative	this bouquet of pink flowers features pink lilies ( stargrazers ) and matching greenery ."
negative	scentless orange lilies were sent as a replacement .
negative	i was not contacted due to the six hour time difference .
negative	i '_ve sent multiple e_- mails about my concerns and each time they sent a response quoting their policy .
negative	their 000_% satisfaction guarantee has not been honored .
negative	this website is crazy .
negative	for the last 0 years i was trying to purchase a specific style of suit .
negative	for the last two years the web sit state there are over five in each size of these suits , and for the lat two years i have received emails after 0 - 0 days stating these suits are not even in their stock .
negative	i hate this company !!!!!!!!
negative	they need to go away for good !
negative	no line , no need to wait while all other rental_car companies had long lines - good thing or raise flag ??
negative	car somewhat clean as if it was handed_over from previous renter .
negative	new car , comfortable yes but rental company should keep_up with the cars services .
negative	my car kept flashing oil service needed , tire_pressure low , tire sensor fault ...
negative	so much that i got a flat_tire and had to change it to the spare tire .
negative	could have been worst and i thank_god it was not .
negative	ez rental don_'_t honor your own car insurance ( even if its a us company ), if pre_- paid gasoline make_sure you use it up cause they wont credit you back any un - use gas .
negative	in my opinion if ez does not take_care of this problems their lines will_continue to be empty and not for great service but for the above mentioned .
negative	great customer_satisfaction is key - for great business satisfaction .
negative	manager - no where in site ..... just a simple who_cares " sorry " and carry on .
negative	its a shame .
negative	i really shouldn_'_t have to be made to give a star for this type of mediocure service and for my opinion on service to be visible to other potential renters who don_'_t see the raised flags .
negative	i would never send anything to opticfast again .
negative	it has_been over a month that they have had my glasses .
negative	there '_s no customer_service if anything goes_wrong , they sent me this rating service to fill_out and i '_ve been trying to get in touch for nearly four days waiting for a reply
negative	i really liked the skype until my account was hacked by someone in russia .
negative	luckily , i caught it before they racked up too much , under_$_000 , but despite all of my efforts i could not get in touch with any type of customer_service from skype .
negative	i just wanted to make_sure this would never happen again , but they obvsiouly had no interest in helping their customers , even when they are the victim .
negative	i will never use skype again for this reason .
negative	i cannot trust a company that will allow my information to be hacked and then provide no customer_service to console me .
negative	my parts are broken open box to open package the vent for back broken
negative	ordered a prescription_diet - they did not contact the vet as they said they would to confirm prescription and after several days of no shipment confirmation , emailed the prescription .
negative	then was told the order , which contained other foods , was to be sent that day .
negative	i received the other products - but no prescription_diet ; the shipment confirmation_email had the prescription_diet listed as being in the shipment .
negative	i contacted petflow that the prescription_diet had not been received - was told it would be sent that day and a shipment confirmation would be sent .
negative	no confirmation of shipment received .
negative	emailed asking for status ( has now been almost 0weeks since order originally placed ) - and was told item was back ordered with no projected date for delivery .
negative	not the way to run a business - especially a prescription_diet for a dog that has to eat only this .
negative	fortunately , i had enough food and obtained the diet elsewhere .
negative	would not recommend this site for prescription diets - they should of notified me immediately that the food was not available !!!
negative	!
negative	i can '_t_believe any company would have use email as their only contact to customer_service !
negative	and that takes days ... ridiculous !!
negative	i will be filing a claim with the better business_bureau citing my grievances with your company !
negative	i have never ordered prescription_glasses online but being that i tried these glasses on at my doctors_office first i knew they would fit .
negative	when i received my glasses they were so stretched that they would fall off my face .
negative	i called to complain but was told to take them somewhere to be adjusted .
negative	i was skeptical that this would work but i took them in anyways .
negative	immediately the doctors_office told me that the frames could not be adjusted enough to work .
negative	i compared the frames they had with the frame i had and it was obvious that the frames were damaged .
negative	i called frames_direct again and was told to send them back so they could adjust them when these frames should be replaced not adjusted .
negative	this has_been a huge in incidence for me .
negative	when you pay over $_000 for a pair of glasses better care needs to be taken
negative	i ordered clothes for my holiday .
negative	delivery was late .
negative	i emailed customer_services but no one replied back .
negative	so i left without it .
negative	now i am back and found that i was sent the wrong_size skirt j ordered was size 0 and i received size00 and i already missed my 00 refund time .
negative	i had worse online experience !!
negative	!
negative	have sent my parcel to be returned 0_weeks_ago and have not heard_anything from boohoo to see if they have receive it .
negative	i have sent 0 emails and i am not getting the answer i need .
negative	if there was an option of no stars i would choose that !
negative	i will never use priceline again , i am booking them for my honeymoon and they wont allow me to extend my stay without paying 000 $!!
negative	they are essentially getting more money because the new flight would be more_expensive !!
negative	rude !
negative	way to ruin my honeymoon this coming october !

negative	they have started trying to force people to put their banking info on there or else they won_'_t allow the transactions to go through .
negative	it should be illegal to do that and am sure they have some way around it , but it made me go away from them since that time .
negative	instead of rewarding the customers for their loyalty and patronage , they try to jerk you around .
negative	very very bad business_ethics or basically no ethics at all .
negative	when i went on line , it said i would have 00_%_off for booking on line , and never did i pay up front the full cos i ' am think of canceling altogether !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	right cars rental used in glasgow for a weekend hire , through_argus hire .
negative	quite a distance off site of the airport .
negative	when we arrived to collect the car we were told there was a £_000 deposit required which apparently was detailed on the conditions of rental .
negative	if anyone can point them out to me i would be really interested to see where it is detailed !
negative	with 0 young_children arriving at 0 pm on a friday and needing to drive 0 hours i needed the car so didn_'_t have much of a choice but to pay the deposit which i was assured would be returned 0 or 0 days after return of the vehicle .
negative	car was returned on time , filled with petrol and with no additional damage .
negative	over a month later the £_000 still has not been returned .
negative	i have mailed and tried to call but to no_avail .
negative	not sure what my next option is but for those wanting to hire a car , pay a little extra and go for a brand_name you can trust .
negative	don_'_t make the mistake i did .
negative	avoid right cars
negative	there is always hoops that you have to jump_through to use your points !
negative	you should be able to use them whenever !
negative	ink ran_out after two uses of one page each time
negative	i got my glasses after a month of waiting , the quality is terrible , i '_ve ordered form the cheap websites before and was happy , but these i couldn_'_t even see out of .... yuk , terrible don_'_t use them .
negative	i '_m cutting my losses on that 00_bucks it '_s not worth dealing_with them , they won_'_t even communicate with you ....
negative	order number 0000000
negative	track it states delivered 0 november_0000 00 . 00 gmt
negative	timing seems unlikely
negative	no garments received so unable to comment .
negative	my order of 00 / 00 / 0000 didn_'_t arrive and i don_'_t had reply from my e_- mails about that order .
negative	spent 00 days and i don_'_t had return , i don_'_t know what to do !
negative	was $_00 , 00 order #_000000000 .
negative	i trusted in your services and now the only_thing i got is a financial loss .
negative	what a pain in the a ## to work with partsgeek !!
negative	i can never reach them by phone & they don_'_t let you know when you send in an_email ticket that you have x amount of email tickets - therefore , since i used up my email tickets i cannot communicate with them at all !!!
negative	consequently i have not received my order as i am now required to contact my credit_card company to give pgeek approval to ship to another address .
negative	how stupid is that !!?
negative	?
negative	they should tell the customer - me - these little stupid rules before i go & waste my time !
negative	!
negative	i have been trying to return my part for the refund for the core_charge and try to exchange another part that i ordered wrong .
negative	i keep getting the same email back saying they will send instructions on how to do it but i never get any .
negative	i can see why you do not have a phone_number to be reached at you dont want to talk to anyone_who has a complaint .
negative	i will be talking to someone on what i can do to get my money back
negative	having purchased an item on 00 / 0 / 00 and only wearing it a few time found that it had a fault , the stitching on the item ( abigail zip front hooded contrast onesie ) had a double row of holes along the stitching edge and was return to you by post on the 0 / 00 / 00 with a copy of proof of postage receipt and am still_waiting for a reply or refund which i am entitle to as the item was fault but as today ’_s date 0 / 00 / 00 have not received any other reply than your automatic email_saying customer_service will deal with this matter as soon as possible and never have , i am still_waiting
negative	do not go near this florist .
negative	my boyfriend bought me what he hoped would be a lovely bouquet of red roses for valentine '_s day .
negative	they were supposed to be delivered early on the day but did not arrive until later because of delivery issues and were left on the doorstep .
negative	i did not arrive home until late in the day and was no_indication on the packaging which way up the box was supposed to be so when i found them they were actually upside_down and the tops of the roses were squashed .
negative	aside from this , it was evident that the roses were tatty and not fresh .
negative	three_days_later they look ready to go in the bin .
negative	my friend bought me some from a well know supermarket chain the same day for a fraction of the price , which still look lovely and probably have at_least a few_days left in them ( you expect 0 days from fresh flowers ).
negative	my boyfriend is so disappointed as he would not have picked these out by hand .
negative	you assume if you order from a florist that the flowers will be fresh and better quality than petrol station forecourts or supermarkets , but these are not .
negative	they were not even competent enough to include the correct valentine '_s card design which my boyfriend had carefully picked out and instead it says ' gift_card ' on the front which totally ruins that it '_s supposed to be a valentine '_s card !
negative	thanks iflorist for ruining what was supposed to be a lovely valentine '_s surprise from my other half .
negative	when we ordered our bathroom we specifically chose items that were in stock and could be delivered within a few_days .
negative	this is because we are renting out the property where the bathroom is to be fitted so we have a short_period in which to fit it .
negative	i was not happy to receive a email booking my delivery date for 0st july !!!
negative	that is almost a month away .
negative	to be fair to vp i have not spoken to them about it yet and i am still hoping this can be sorted .
negative	i did try to phone but got the usual " your call is in a queue blah_blah .....".
negative	fingers_crossed it will be sorted or i will have to cancel the order .
negative	update - i have tried to call them today , after a number of abandoned attempts yesterday , and decided to stick it out and wait for my call to be answered .
negative	i finally gave up after one hour !!!!!
negative	frustrated doesn_'_t even begin to cover it .
negative	i ordered a door_handle replacement and they sent me the wrong door_handle .
negative	i '_ve had to crawl back and forth from the back seat to get into my car as i wait for another handle .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	still_waiting for order from chemist_direct , bit of advice , do not contact them in an_emergency .
negative	paid for next_day delivery 0 days ago !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered some flip_flops , nothing special , but to be delivered to my work address .
negative	the courier company superdry use didn_'_t hang_around for me to sign for the parcel and it went missing for 0 days !
negative	while superdry '_s responses were quick , my details were passed_onto so many people !
negative	i had calls from everyone !
negative	i contacted the company to complain_about their courier , they told me it was superdry '_s issue , superdry say it '_s not their fault !
negative	a pathetic half hearted apology from superdry who continue to have the cheek to send me daily emails !
negative	would never order online again !
negative	terrible service !
negative	i recently booked a hotel through priceline for a specific nightly rate .
negative	when i got to the hotel , i was charged an_additional non_- optional ' resort_fee ' of $_00 per_night which was not disclosed to me until i was there checking in .
negative	this fee was assessed whether i chose to use the resort facilities or not .
negative	priceline said that hotels can charge additional_fees and that this is in the fine_print of their agreement so i had not recourse .
negative	so buyer_beware .
negative	i felt taken_advantage of .
negative	we ordered a case of wine and were charged $_00 for shipping took over a week for the shipment to go out , then another 0 days to reach our house .
negative	my regular company was out of my food so i ordered from pet_flow even_though it was more_expensive than my usual place .
negative	my food was delivered to the wrong_address .
negative	i was getting ready to go to the store for emergency supplies when my neighbor who had been out of town for the holidays brought it to me .
negative	not a happy_camper .
negative	i paid $_00 for the card to be sent overnight .
negative	the card arrived 0 days_later .
negative	i ordered stuff from petflow and then ordered other stuff from around the same area and i got the other stuff long before i got the things i ordered from petflow will not order from them again if the service is that slow .
negative	had been a customer for several_years and was happy however , when i called one day regarding my pets prescription food they had no_clue about the vet even_though i had given them this information several_times over the years ( they had the rx on file ) and the food had been getting shipped to me .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor and was told different " stories " each time as to why one was not available .
negative	i lost faith in this company .
negative	they gave_me the run_around and treated me badly on the phone .
negative	i have found it much_easier to order through my vet even_though it cost a bit more it is worth it to avoid all the stress and lies from a company that had my information and then told me that they " had lost it ".
negative	i tried petflow when amazon was out of my cat_food .
negative	i ordered on the 0th and when i contacted them on the 00th about my order , they had not even placed my order yet !!!!
negative	i was advised that i would receive my order on the 00th and i received a manilla envelope w_/ samples from their promotional club " spoiled_rotten " club .
negative	i contacted them again and was told that they were out if stock and that they would have to get my order from another warehouse and that it would be the next week before they could ship my order .
negative	it is now the00th and i received a text stating that my order would be here on the 00nd .
negative	what was suppose to be 0 to 0 days has now turned into 00 days . informed that they were out of stock and that they would ship the next week .
negative	i received a text from them on the 00th stating that they would deliver my product on the 00nd , 00 days from my order date .
negative	what was suppose to take 0 to 0 days , turned into a joke .
negative	the customer_service department told me something different every time i called and did not seem to know what was in stock and not .
negative	maybe additional training is needed in customer_service and inventory / quality control .
negative	when i voiced my concern about their service and asked for the current 00_%_off that they are currently offering , i was told that they could not do that but they did offer me a $_00 credit on my next order ( as if i will ever order from this company again ).
negative	horrible experience and no effort was made to keep me as a customer .
negative	still_waiting for the dog_food i ordered last_week
negative	i didn_'_t know when my stuff was coming casue never sent tracking and the shipping for the item is too much , but when got refund for an item they didnt ' have was just $ 0 . 00 .
negative	i only found out that item wasn_'_t going to be shipped because i emailed them about why i still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	probably will be last time i order from amiclub_wear .
negative	don_'_t even get me started .
negative	from the time the agent answered the phone until he hung_up , it was nothing but a bunch of lies .
negative	they still owe me $_00 . 00 because i cancelled one night the same night that i booked .
negative	they changed the prices and said that the second night was only 000 . 00 , but the agent told me when i booked that their normal rate was $_000 . 00 per_night ; however , they were running a special for $_000 . 00 per_night .
negative	when i went to cancel the second night , they said the first night was $_000 . 00 and the second night was $_000 . 00 .
negative	the agent also told me that they were the only ones that booked the motels in the area that i was looking to stay .
negative	that was a lie also .
negative	also , when i ask his name , he said " mike ".
negative	that is not the name he gave at the beginning of the conversation .
negative	i will never do_business with reservation_counter again .
negative	was sent this e_- mail to rate futonland , but have not received my order yet !
negative	( 0_weeks )
negative	i opened the account on trail basis used a 00 cent stamp and was charged 00 $ fee fro every_month and when called to close the account they wanted to charge a closing fee and not help on the fees already charged .
negative	they truly cheated me on this .
negative	please do not try this they are ripping and sucking money out of us for nothing .
negative	when flights get redirected , arrival times and paid - for transportation pick - up times need to change .
negative	it is impossible to reach anyone by email or phone ( on hold for 00 + minutes without ever reaching customer_support on more than one occasion ).
negative	they do not stand_behind the services they provide , when you attempt to obtain recompense for services not provided as contracted , you are transferred to a manager who then disconnects the call .
negative	do not buy from travelocity !
negative	i ordered 0 tickets back in november for robbie at manchester for friday 00st june_0000 .
negative	i have not recieved my tickets as of yet , i have e_- mailed and rung but they say if i havent recieved my tickets by wednesday to ring back , what a joke we are supposed to be travelling early friday_morning so i dont_think there is much hope of us recieving tickets .
negative	i will not be using this website again and will be looking at legal advice as you have already taken my money for the tickets and we have already paid for the hotel .
negative	my transaction number is 0000000 .
negative	i ordered a dayco timing_belt kit wp000l0b on feb 00 - mon - 0000 .
negative	kit came in with a missing hydraulic timing_belt actuator #_00000 .
negative	partsgeek was notified of parts missing same day it came - feb 0 - fri - 0000 .
negative	we used all parts of the kit , but we had to purchase the missing hydraulic timing_belt actuator from autozone0our cost -$_000 .
negative	we need to fix the car a s a p for our needed use of car .
negative	partsgeek was notifed by usps - certified mail twice - hard_copy that we did not receive the complete kit .
negative	partsgeek wants us to send back the dayco timing_belt kit back to california when parts of it from the kit are allready used in the car .
negative	partsgeek is difficult to contact by phone - can '_t talk to someone - only customer_support_ticket from their website - andi was not able to e_- mail them - their e_- mail address was not valid .
negative	products were o k but communication problems with partsgeek is terrible .
negative	we reserved a car through_travelocity at the san_diego airport .
negative	not only was our car not there when we arrived ( they agency said they had zero cars in their lot ), but neither the agency or travelocity would do anything about it .
negative	we were forced to take an expensive taxi ride to our hotel and spend the rest of the evening trying to get a car for the rest of our trip .
negative	we were able to find another car through_travelocity with a different agency for the remainder of our trip but we did this all on our own and without a bit of help from travelocity .
negative	we do not feel they " made it right ".
negative	we were out our taxi ride expense , the difference in the car_rental rates , and valuable vacation time .
negative	we have contacted travelocity about our experience but have not heard a word back from them .
negative	i had the worst_experience ever today with a customer_service manager , and will be forced to dispute a charge on my account because of everything that resulted from my situation .
negative	i know that i correctly inputted my hotel reservation details and was really careful about it .
negative	i made a reservation and did not notice the mistake immediately but after an_hour passed and i re - checked my reservation everything was wrong !!!
negative	i called today to rectify a clearly obvious mistake that was made on the website and everyone refused to help me because of a policy that was in place .
negative	i understand the policy & work with policies everyday as a compliance agent .
negative	i also come from a cs background and understand there are times when cs meets compliance and depending_on the situations , changes can be made to assist a customer .
negative	my situation is simple ...
negative	i made a reservation to my liking but because i had multiple tabs open , something went drastically wrong with my reservation .
negative	the date , the room type and the discount were wrong .
negative	instead of helping_me the cs manager penalized me .
negative	he made me pay an_additional night per policies because today is 0 / 00 .
negative	my reservation was supposed to be for may 00th not april 00 .
negative	the room was for a king_bed not 0 double_beds .
negative	there was supposed to be a 00_%_discount , there was no discount .
negative	after arguing for almost an_hour .
negative	i was charged a night_stay for over 000_dollars to change my reservation date .
negative	this was sooo unfair .
negative	this company makes money by stealing from its customers who only need some assistance with special situation .
negative	waited over a month for glasses that never showed_up !
negative	after a month i asked to cancel the order and they told me that i would get charged a 00_% fee .
negative	avoided numerous_emails when i asked for a simple eta .
negative	after i asked for a refund they charged my card and said i would have a tracking_number by the next_day .
negative	0 days_later still no tracking_number !
negative	disputing with my amex .
negative	stay far away !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a visa_gift_card for a friend .
negative	i paid over 00 . 00 to be , what it sounded_like , delivered overnight by fedex !
negative	it did not arrive until 0 days_later !
negative	i think that stinks !
negative	would like to have my 00 . 00 refunded !
negative	i tried to cancel the second night of my 0 night_stay at a hotel , but what actually happened was that i cancelled both nights .
negative	i immediately called expedia and told them i only want to cancel the second night and was told that i was charged a 0 night_stay penalty for cancelling .
negative	i tried to explain i still wanted the first night and just wanted to cancel the second night .
negative	what i was told was that i had to pay the 0 night_stay cancellation and would not get the room either unless i paid another night .
negative	expedia and their travel now program are scams .
negative	won_'_t use travelocity again .
negative	good bargains but customer_service lacking .
negative	long_waits on hold when trying to get questions_answered .
negative	more trouble than it '_s worth .
negative	never again would i order anything from gamermodz
negative	i attended boots in holbury , southampton to purchase some headache tablets .
negative	there were some people already waiting for prescriptions so i waited in line .
negative	when it came to my turn the lady serving turned round went around the back and started to take a delivery .
negative	eventually a pharmacist came around to give a prescription to a customer and said to me " someone will be with you in a moment , you will have to wait ".
negative	00_minutes later as i went to leave ( with a good 0 - 0 people behind me as well ) the lady_who was serving came back round and said " you have to wait like everybody else ".
negative	00_minutes is not an acceptable time to wait when there is no - one else being served !!
negative	i work at a hospital and if i told patients on the phone you will have to wait 00_minutes before i can be bothered to pick_up the phone , i am sure they would not be impressed !
negative	this is not the first time my husband and i have received shoddy service from this particular boots branch .
negative	it is about time these people had a lesson in customer_service and good manners !
negative	the pharmacist should be at the top of the list !
negative	needless to say this branch will not be used again , appalling !!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered lemon sorbet bouquet for my mum for mother '_s day and received three pink_roses , one with the head off completely and the other rose buds already going brown and not much else other than greenery !
negative	i ordered yellow specifically as it is my mum '_s favourite colour - what a total_rip_off for £_00 .
negative	worst florists i have ever_dealt_with and wish i had seen all these other comments before i used them , anyway i have advised friends etc never to use this useless bunch ( pardon the pun ) and i imagine if they carry on their shambolic way of running things they will hopefully be out of business very soon before they can rip_off anymore poor unsuspecting people .
negative	i wish their was a no star available on these ........... should have realised what they were like when i saw it was yodel delivering !!!
negative	!
negative	delivery was swift but unfortunately they sent the wrong product and trying to tell them so i can get a refund has_been too difficult .
negative	won_'_t use them again .
negative	my dress ripped the first night i wore it and they wouldn_'_t let_me return it or get any type of refund !
negative	terrible service
negative	found purehealth after_researching the net and thought it was a great company , read that they had to hire more because of the recognition of the product i ordered " green_coffee bean " anyway .......... ordered it on 0 / 0 / 00 online , nothing .. tried to call the phone # provided , it said the lines were full ( couldn_'_t leave a message ) noone answered .
negative	found a way thru their phone system ( i used to be in cust serv ) so i left a message to the only line it would allow me to leave a message .
negative	there was no way and still is no way to track my order .
negative	i did not receive a tracking #, have no_clue what is going on .
negative	finally on 0 / 00 / 00 ( 00 days_later !)
negative	someone calls me and says hey we got your order and we are going to be shipping it out today .
negative	so i should get charged , yadda yadda yadda ..... soo now it is 0 / 00 / 00 ..
negative	still no sign of my order , no email to tell me what the hell is going on ( you know could of apologized , sorry we had to hire on more people something as to what the hell happened ) and still no sign of it .
negative	now i get this email_stating .. to tell us about your experience .. well it sucks ..
negative	someone gave_me another website that dr . oz actually uses but i thought no i am gonna give this pure_health a go and look what happened ?
negative	horrible experience for the customer ( me !)...
negative	should be more communication as to why your taking over a month to provide my product , it your out of the inventory don_'_t waste my time i will go elsewhere .
negative	where if i don_'_t here something very soon ..
negative	this will be the first and last time i use this website .........
negative	i say if your looking for what dr . oz suggests and go to this site , check elsewhere .
negative	i bought a tap and a sink from this company in june .
negative	it was installed in mid august and the flat was tenanted in mid october .
negative	the tap broke in late january this year , after less_than 0 months of use .
negative	when i contacted the company i discovered you can '_t actually speak to anyone unless you are prepared to pay £ 0 . 00 per_minute on their premium line .
negative	otherwise you must open a " ticket " and someone responds to you , or not ...
negative	the tap listing included a prominent fifteen year_warranty sign so i was amazed when they told me the tap was only covered by a six month warranty and that this had expired .
negative	i repeatedly asked for a refund and advised i would take it further , with no success .
negative	i contacted which magazine '_s helpline and they agreed that the company had breached the sale of goods act .
negative	i then contacted trading_standards via the citizens advice consumer advice line .
negative	they also agreed that my consumer rights had been breached and advised me to write to the company .
negative	this is where i am up to at the moment , but in the meantime , i '_ve gone to homebase to buy a new tap !
negative	i would not , under any circumstances buy anything from this company .
negative	if anything goes_wrong then , based on my experience , you can forget about it .
negative	i am very , very disappointed that a company could so blatantly flout the legislation .
negative	i waited for 0 days for my order .
negative	i had to go to petco and buy 0 cans of dog_food
negative	we have tried many_times to get someone on the phone & hang up after 0 / 0 hour .
negative	the entire trip was a disaster .
negative	will not go through_travelocity ever again .
negative	i tried to utilize their express service .
negative	i chose an offer , accepted it , but they were unable to fulfill , as their screen message essentially said things are changing in real time and the offer was no_longer available .
negative	so , i refreshed screen and they made the same offer back again .
negative	i tried to fulfill and again was told it was no_longer available .
negative	this happened 0 times .
negative	i opened my checking acct .
negative	info online and saw that priceline put a hold on my account 0 times for 0 offers they could not fulfill .
negative	the holds were full price each time , or $_000 . 00 ( once i tried a different offer with a total of $_000 . 00 ).
negative	so i had 0 holds at $_000 . 00 and one for $_000 . 00 .
negative	when i contacted their customer_service because they literally had $ 0000 . 00 on hold in my checking_account which caused my available balance to dwindle by that number ( and interfered with other legitimate charges for other merchants ), they told me not to worry , the holds would drop_off in 0 business days .
negative	so , in other words , they were not the least bit_concerned or sorry that they had holds on my checking_account that can and did wreak havoc in the account .
negative	to ensure they cannot have this rating removed for inaccurate information , the holds were placed on their reservation numbers :
negative	00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 , 00000000000 .
negative	it took me almost 0 hours ( because they can only release one hold at a time ) to get these removed from my account , and they were not the least bit apologetic about the issue .
negative	no offers for amends were made , either .
negative	i closed my account with them today , but i still arguably have legitimate legal matters that i can and am considering taking up with them .
negative	the reservation that did go through was a nightmare .
negative	i did an express bid on 0 hotel_rooms .
negative	the reservation i got was for 0 condos on a compound that had condos literally miles apart_from each other .
negative	the company with the condos said they could not give me 0 condos next door to each other and even then , priceline would not cancel at_least one of my reservations .
negative	i was bidding on 0 hotel_rooms .... i needed hotel_rooms as we wanted a separate room for our children .
negative	what we got we could not use , because i could not use two condos that were a mile apart_from each other , with my children being in one of them and my husband and myself being in another .
negative	priceline advertised 0 hotel_rooms in the express bid and gave_us two condos , which were so_far apart they would require a car to travel between them .
negative	they did not give full disclosure up front and are , in my opinion , responsible for false_advertising .
negative	i am happy to be a former customer .
negative	my recipient had to look deep to figure_out how to use after registering ..... we didn_'_t realize it can '_t be printed and used anywhere ?
negative	if we are wrong , it '_s not clear .
negative	i did .
negative	your customer_service is the best thing about your company .
negative	i have asked a number of times for your customer_service to get back to me so that i can cancel this subscription .
negative	i havent used the site for such a long time and i cant even log in because i dont remember my log in details .
negative	i am getting very upset that no one has responded !
negative	it took three_days to place an order .
negative	customer_service would answer put me on hold and never come_back .
negative	finally the third day i was able to place my order but if service does not emprove i will find another_vendor .
negative	my order of almost $_000 was canceled because the shipping address and my billing_address were different .
negative	i tried their customer_service ticket system online giving them my phone_number stating to contact me with no response .
negative	after a few_days i tried again and their website told me i had too many open tickets .
negative	i tried_calling their 000 number several_times with no answer at all .
negative	i realize that the different_addresses can be a security issue , but with nobody at the billing_address most of the time i did not want all that stuff sitting out up for grabs .
negative	i would never order from parts_geek ever again .
negative	i have issues with the order and was not able to speak with someone .
negative	everything had to be done online .
negative	any time of the day you call you would get the same message which tells you that it is an auto message .
negative	it took much longer to receive the books then the estimated time and when i finally received the second book i ordered , it was the wrong one .
negative	i had to keep it and order the correct one through someone_else causing me to waste money and time .
negative	ordered emblem for auto advertised as trunk emblem for that make and model and it was not
negative	my order tracking said it was delivered but it wasnt and customer_service did not respond to my email about the missing package .
negative	i called wanting to extend my already booked reservation .
negative	the person_who handled my call was not very helpful and seemed like she just wanted to get off the phone .
negative	there was a lot of noise in the background which made listening very hard .
negative	i did get impatient and ended the call .
negative	then i went online and took_care of the booking myself .
negative	i should have done this in the first place .
negative	i will use this website again , if necessary , but hopefully not the call in service .
negative	the service that i have received from vision_direct has_been shocking .
negative	i have requested at_least twice_now an update of where my glasses are with no reply .
negative	they promised a reply in 00_hours and nothing !
negative	this has to be some of the worst service i have ever received in australia .
negative	i don_'_t even believe they are an australian based business .
negative	this is getting to the point where if i don_'_t receive my glasses i will be contacting the police because vision_direct have taken payment but not delivered on their_promises which in australian law is essentially theft whether it is from a business or an individual .
negative	i expect a personal response to this in 00_hours or i will be posting another review of your service .
negative	ordered the trophy at the begining of december , paid_extra for speedy_delivery , said i needed by december_00th , was told it had been sent a week_later .
negative	now december_00th and still no trophy .
negative	golf game is over and no trophy , very disappointed .
negative	ordered flowers as a thank_you gift 0 days ago and they still have not been delivered .
negative	i wanted to send them as a surprise , royal_mail informed me that the flowers we ' re took to a depot in a box where they would have to stay all weekend because the depot is closed .
negative	the company advised a card had been put through the recipients door i has to spoil the surprise and tell her about it and she advised me there was no card put through the door .
negative	what flower company instructs their courier to take undelivered items to a depot to be left there to die , now when she receives them they will probably be dead .
negative	i spoke to prestige_flowers who basically said it wasn_'_t there problem !
negative	no one will help me and all i can do is to leave this review as a warning to other potential_customers not to buy flowers from prestige_flowers once they send the items out they do not care what happens as they already have your money .
negative	all i wanted to of was send a thankyou gift to a very kind lady_who has helped_me with my wedding planning and the gesture has_been ruined by this company incompetence .
negative	i '_m very upset about the whole situation never again !
negative	the wesite offered one mower but i received another .
negative	when i emailed abbey gardens asking for an explaination i was ignored and i still wait for a reply !
negative	not happy !
negative	i could have purchased this mower cheaper elsewhere .
negative	awful experience flight was changed about 00 times , the last time being less_than 00_hours before our flight home very frustrating .
negative	spent 0 hours on the phone with travelocity agenda on my last day of vacation .
negative	one agent kept me on hold for 0 hours .
negative	delivery was not good at all - left flowers on the street .
negative	i received the wrong order not once but twice !!
negative	!
negative	we ordered two controllers for my kids for christmas and still have not recieved one of them .
negative	they won_'_t even answer the phone .
negative	i have emailed 0 times with no response .
negative	its been a month .
negative	terrible !
negative	if i could rate one star i wouls !
negative	i ordered a silicone jelly skin case for my atrix which showed was in stock on the website .
negative	i went through the order process where they promptly took my payment .
negative	i then receive an_email a few_days_later saying the cases are on backorder and i would
negative	receive an_email when was shipped .
negative	fast forward 0 months and i finally receive the email that my case shipped and i could pick it up at their warehouse which is only about 000_miles from my house !
negative	i ordered this case with the understanding it would ship via mail to my home .
negative	i emailed them explaining that the distance was much too far for a case .
negative	their reply was that i would have to pay out more money to have it sent directly to my house .
negative	i thought that had already been taken_care of when i originally placed the order .
negative	needlees to say , after they sent me several harassing emails trying to get me to fork over more money , they figured_out i wasnt going to buy into their scam and cancelled my order .
negative	if you order from this company , do so at your own risk .
negative	bolox bolox bolox
negative	this company is the worst i have dealt_with in over 00 years .
negative	first of all when you call , none of the customer_service people can tell you where your order is .
negative	i spoke to 0 .
negative	i paid for expedited_shipping and was sent an e_- mail telling_me the gift_card had been shipped usps and would arrive in 0 to 00 business days .
negative	none of the people could tell me when it was shipped , how or could give me a fed_ex tracking_number .
negative	the gift_card arrived in 0 days , even_though i paid for the faster shipping method .
negative	i was told by the customer_service people , " the card will arrive sometime between friday and tuesday .
negative	wow that narrows it down .
negative	i would never use this service again .
negative	the worst in service , customer_satisfaction and handling issues .
negative	none of the customer_service reps have a clue .
negative	i also was on the phone with the customer_service people over 00_minutes with each call and still did not get an answer .
negative	go buy the card yourself and send it 0 day , have no frustration and you can track it .
negative	not pleased with condition of glasses .
negative	had to go retrieve them from post_office since no one was home when delivery occurred .
negative	would like to give you minus stars for this experience . got on this site trying to book a room frm marriott .
negative	agent answers as " reservations and support ", so i didn_'_t realize not marriott site .
negative	explained i wanted to use points to book 0night hotel .
negative	agent did not identify site as 0rd_party booking .
negative	i kept questioning why iwas quoted nightly rate , when i was using points .
negative	agent insisted i had to book it with credit_card first .
negative	asked again if he could check on points .
negative	evasive answers ... didn_'_t ever say i was on wrong site .
negative	never got a straight answer .
negative	had a bad feeling , so cancelled it .
negative	had to beg for email cancellation proof .
negative	are these agents trained to film - flam customers , or just_plain stupid ?
negative	i rented my book from bookbyte for $_00 .
negative	and , when it arrived it was a review copy .
negative	a copy made by the publisher that is not to be sold .
negative	i guess they think they are being clever by renting it out instead of selling it , but it is still wrong that they are making money off of this book that was complimentary .
negative	booked two double_beds .
negative	when i arrived at the hotel , there was no reservation in my name at all .
negative	i called customer_support and was put on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	finally , got a room but not apology .
negative	when we got into the room , it was a king_bed and a very uncomfortable roll - a - way bed .
negative	will never use them again .
negative	my mum ordered a cardigan from their catalogue .
negative	they phoned her and told her they had no stock in the size she had ordered , and would not be getting more in , but would she accept the next size down as an_alternative .
negative	she agreed and they asked for her bank_account details again .
negative	of course she should have refused and told them this was not another order so they would not be needing to take further payment - but what can i say , she is 00 and naive and trusting .
negative	the very next_day the item arrived in the size originally ordered .
negative	she phoned them to ask them not to send the other item and was told that it had already been despatched but that she should refuse to accept it when it arrived .
negative	this she duly did .
negative	to cut a long_story short gray and osbourn took £_00 and £ 0 . 00 for postage and packaging out of her account twice .
negative	once on the 0 september and again on the 0th .
negative	they are now saying that they have not received the second item back from their courier company and that they cannot refund my mother '_s money until they ' investigate '.
negative	they are sending my mother something out to sign and return to them .
negative	if , and it '_s a big if , she does get her money back they will have had it for well over a month .
negative	this is entirely unacceptable .
negative	they accept no responsibility for the fact that the whole fiasco was their mistake .
negative	to my mind taking the second payment out was fraudulent .
negative	my mother only ever ordered one item .
negative	i have reported them to consumerline and am awaiting their advice .
negative	my advice to other consumers is steer_clear .
negative	flowers received were later than guaranteed .
negative	the flowers started to droop within 00_hrs and died after 0 days .
negative	paid 00 $ for a bunch , in walmart were worth 0 $
negative	tried numerous_times to contact the company , with no response .
negative	une commande passée le 00 juillet .
negative	aucune info sur_la_livraison .
negative	c ' est en relançant plusieurs fois le service que l ' on m ' a informée de_la non disponibilité d ' un article .
negative	au final , un article m ' a été livré le 00 août mais d ' une autre couleur et_j ' attend toujours un remboursement .
negative	aucune communication .
negative	aucun sérieux .
negative	plus de commande sur golfstoreeurope .
negative	i have a screen printout of the $_00 special bookit nightly rate plus 00_% tax and a $_00 . 00 daily resort_fee .
negative	then as soon as i paid it shows it charged me $_000 . 00 .
negative	i can only call to get help and they charge $_00 . 00 fee for a rep to put you on hold for 00_minutes and never come_back .
negative	i am writing the bbb about these scumbags .
negative	horrible company !!!
negative	!
negative	the sunglasses i ordered ( burberry ) arrived broken .
negative	when i contacted customer_service at smartbuy it took them about a week to respond and they asked to see proof that the glasses were broken .
negative	finally they gave_me an address where i could return the sunglasses , at my own_expense of course .
negative	it has now been over a month since i placed my order and i have not received a refund , or another pair of sunglasses .
negative	i also question the authenticity of the sunglasses - my optometrist friend advised me that they were fake , and they were shipped from hong_kong .
negative	i wish i had never purchased with smartbuyglasses !
negative	beware that the prices shown , even if they say they include all fees and taxes , do not .
negative	you will not see this extra amount until after you put your credit_card in .
negative	the customer_service in india is next to useless .
negative	my suggestion is - use the site to select best price for day , time and airline , then go to the airline site to make your purchase .
negative	at_least then you will get customer_service by someone in this country .
negative	visited wren '_s in jan_0000 and choose a kitchen and bedroom_suite , after many hours of design .
negative	all going well and order place , also be mistake paid up from wrong !!!
negative	ok date was set for progress to take place feb_00th 0000 kitchen was taken out and rubbish all dumped at front ready for collection .
negative	progress made on fitting kitchen then only to be told splash backs won_'_t be available till end of march , ok i '_ll wait progress continued then floor was fitted as ordered by wrens and measured by designer .
negative	there wasn_'_t enough phone manager and designer , designer argued i should pay for extra flooring and it wasn_'_t his fault also had missing door from kitchen unit .
negative	spoke to manager who was totally useless and never got back to me when promised .
negative	rubbish should be collected in 0 days nope it was over a week rotting away in front garden .
negative	constant phone_calls emails then told flooring would be ordered and they would pay it arrived 00th_march along with door .
negative	the splash backs arrived 0th april_0000 my kitchen was finish at last on the 00th_april_0000 .
negative	two months after it should of been finished , management terrible , customer_service disgusting and waste of time .
negative	never will i recommend wrens to anyone ever !!!
negative	don_'_t bother the only good thing great hard working kitchen fitters that have to did with wrens mistakes .
negative	you make constant calls and emails nothing gets done its a joke !!
negative	!
negative	i paid for the item through paypal and they said they would let_me know when the item had been dispatched and haven_'_t heard or recieved a thing since !!
negative	the money has_been taken from my bank_account and then i was asked to fill in a satisfaction survey !!
negative	great customer_service , con more like !
negative	!
negative	the jacket i ordered looked nothing like it did in the picture .
negative	i also ordered a small , but it looked like a medium or a large .
negative	i '_m very unhappy with it , so i won_'_t be buying anything_else from this website & i wouldn_'_t recommend it to anyone !
negative	bought deal and received it over a week_ago .
negative	accidentally bought 0 as paypal was v slow going through and thought it hadn_'_t worked so bought second one on credit_card .
negative	have emailed them 0 separate times over past week and had no response at all .
negative	i expect a full_refund of one of these as i am entitled too , having notified them within 0 days as contract states .
negative	if i do not get a response within next few_days will start make a claim through paypal or credit_card to be reimbursed .
negative	once this issue has resolved i shall unsubscribe immediately and share my experience with as many people as possible .
negative	a response by email is long overdue !
negative	appallled at this lack of customer_service .
negative	i booked a trip through_travelocity - air , and hotel .
negative	when i received confirmation from the hotel , i noticed that it stated a king_bed , when i had booked two queens for my family of four .
negative	i called the hotel to add a night and to confirm the room type because clearly a king_bed wouldn_'_t work for two adults and two children .
negative	the hotel stated that they would not guarantee a room type when booked through a third_party and i would not know what type of room i had until i arrived .
negative	when i called travelocity to discuss this problem , the response i received from the agent was completely insincere and the information was misrepresented .
negative	i cancelled our reservation and will not use travelocity again .
negative	amiclubwear is the worst place i have ever ordered from .
negative	no one picks the phone when you call .
negative	in my first order they did not include the sale which was 00_percent .
negative	i tried to call no one picked at all .
negative	i spent hours and hours ordering when paying they tell you some items are not available .
negative	y were they added to the bag ?
negative	when paying sometimes you click credut card and then you are sent to paypal then they say its a fraud .
negative	you call no one picks you write them emails no one replies .
negative	the worst shopping xperience .
negative	boohoo '_s service is just terrible !!
negative	they charge £ 0 . 00 for standard delivery which states your order will arrive in 0 - 0 working days .
negative	i have waited 00 days for my parcel to arrive and its still not arrived !
negative	they have no contact number just an_email which they take days to reply , when they do reply they are very unhelpful !
negative	for 0 months i have been trying to get my necklace sent back to me , which i have already paid for !!
negative	nobody will return my phone_calls or email me back !!
negative	i lost $_00 in this deal !
negative	they only care about getting your money !
negative	not satisfying customers !
negative	unfortunately i was not able to go because my wallet got stolen on the way to the air port .
negative	i called to see if there '_s anyway i can have a partial_refund since i didn_'_t go on my vacation the rep decided to cancel the entire booking not just my part and claimed fraud to the hotel leaving my friend without a room after she checked in !!!!
negative	and then forced us to rebook since the trip has gotten canceled .
negative	did not care at all that their rep made a mistake when i called about the issue i got hung_up on at_least 0 times until a decent human_being got on the phone and actually helped_us .
negative	and when i say helped_us i mean we had no choice but to rebook a room at our own_expense .... after your rep completely screwed_up , not even a discount !!
negative	!
negative	best believe i will be talking to a lawyer and if in any way possible what has_been done is illegal i will deal with it accordingly .
negative	horrible booking experience horrible
negative	i wasted my time .
negative	i was trying to get my credit_scores and it says sorry but you cannot at this time .
negative	it was a waste of my time .
negative	i need to call and cancel this .
negative	they told me a canceled reservation might take 00 days to appear on my credit_card .
negative	how dare they ???!!
negative	!
negative	the four bottles of acacia organic skin oil is stale and has an offensive odor .
negative	joan raciti
negative	greedy company .
negative	i used vetrx for the first time .
negative	they told me i would receive my order this last tuesday .
negative	it '_s thursday and i '_ve still not received it .
negative	i called and spoke to a rude rep and then erica a supervisor that explained that they use ups and transfer to us mail ... i received this survey and i still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	00 days now .
negative	so if you use this company don_'_t be in a hurry .
negative	i asked if i could return the order since i had to buy at the vet anyway since this took so long .
negative	erica explained that the drugs cannot be returned and thats the law and i understand that but the other items i purchased could be returned for a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	my advice is check with your vet .
negative	my vets price for the prescription_drugs was cheeper than verrx .
negative	plus they don_'_t do what they say .
negative	i would rate this hotel a 0_star not a 0 , but i couldn_'_t get the rating section to change .
negative	the service was excellent .
negative	the room was very clean amd spacious .
negative	the continental_breakfast had a lot to offer .
negative	our room was a dallas cowboy themed room , which was nice .
negative	there is a small kitchenette in the room .
negative	bought a tiger onesie for my boyfriend , sent it straight back , overpriced , poor quality , material was cheap and nasty , scratchy not soft , took a while to come , overall not impressed .
negative	i ordered a dress a few_months back .
negative	it was delivered to an address .
negative	ave asked for this to be investergated as the person said it was not delivered there , nor did she sign for any parcel .
negative	i am still_waiting for a response from boohoo
negative	if you can use another sistem , go very far away from paypal .
negative	there are a coyotes service
negative	i had paid_extra to have a set day / afternoon delivery between 00md and 0pm , yesterday .
negative	0 / 0 my order was delivered by [_external reference_] and they kindly texted me that they would deliver between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00hrs , which they did - fantastic service .
negative	i certainly can '_t say they same about yodel .
negative	i waited in for several more hours , constantly tracking the order on the link to yodel , and the parcel continued to say delivery for yesterday , but i decided to ring them as it was still saying it '_s at their depot .
negative	i found it near on impossible to find a telephone_number to ring them at first !
negative	it seems they make themselves near on impossible to contact by hiding their telephone_numbers !
negative	when i eventually found it and phoned it was an_automated voice saying press :
negative	0 .
negative	for ........
negative	0 .
negative	for ........
negative	0 .
negative	for tracking
negative	0 .
negative	for .......
negative	then press star to ' listen to numbers again
negative	then a long pause ( so you think they '_ve finished ) then
negative	0 .
negative	to speak to someone
negative	i really believe this a ploy to discourage callers !
negative	it wasn_'_t until my 0rd phone_call that i worked this out , but initially i used the automated voice for tracking , by pressing 0 but that wouldn_'_t recognise the reference_number that was on their own tracking_information !
negative	when finally , eventually , i spoke to someone , they didn_'_t recognise their number either .
negative	i had to make every_effort to be polite by the time i eventually got through , only to find they won_'_t deliver today , they told me that they have been busy and have put the delivery back to tomorrow , even_though we still have a couple of hours to go !
negative	i paid for this time_slot and what is the point of giving out tacking information saying delivery yesterday ?
negative	and even worse , no - one let_me know !
negative	i have to wait in again today .
negative	i '_ve told them , and they agreed , it has to be delivered by 0 . 00am as i have plans !
negative	i '_ve just looked at tracking again and it '_s still in their depot , i '_m not very optimistic .
negative	their service is appalling , i don_'_t understand any company use them !
negative	i will certainly inform the company that supplied my parcel , on the comparison between [_external reference_] and yodel !
negative	i ordered a book from bookbyte and waited a week for it .
negative	finally i emailed bookbyte to see what was going on with my order to find that they cancelled my order without my consent .
negative	i needed the book urgently to do homework for my class that week and they didnt even offer any store credit or free_shipping !
negative	cheap asses , im spreading the word not to use bookbyte .
negative	when ringing the customer_service to find out about my next_day delivery the response and feedback that i received was all about the small_print .
negative	very few people actually review the small_print but it seems to be used as a scape goat for the people on the end of the phone to give reasons for poor service .
negative	when someone sees next_day delivery in large letters they expect it to be on the next working day and not only if the order is placed at a certain time , this indicates in the advert that it should be next_day ( it does not say please read terms and conditions concerning next_day delivery ) this should be made very clear and wasn_'_t , very poor service and no straight answers given .
negative	wanted to cancel my order but was told that it would cost me even more money to do this so you have the customer by the b ** lls .
negative	i ordered about 0 items from born_pretty store just to see if i would be disappointed , and surely what i thought would happen , happened .
negative	i didn_'_t go overboard with my order .
negative	thank_god i didn_'_t .
negative	so what '_s the excuse for my small order not being shipped ?
negative	i sent two different tickets , closed one and made another still no response , but your false_advertising says you '_ll respond in 0day ... bull !
negative	.
negative	what '_s the point of having a customer_service button with no darn customer_service !!!
negative	wack , wack , wack !
negative	i '_m annoyed and i feel bamboozled !
negative	born_pretty store never again .
negative	i selected epson brand printer_inks and the code required for my printer and was sent an_alternative supposedly compatible product .
negative	as i have had previous bad_experience of such products , i have returned these inferior products , but have yet to receive a refund .
negative	maybe a once off as have used company before and no_problems .
negative	drivers were grumpy , in s rush ( though i ' d paid £_00 for delivery to include installation ) and not skilled enough to manoeuvre a large and heavy appliance .
negative	though it wouldn_'_t usually be a problem that they had little english , one couldn_'_t understand any in fact , they also couldn_'_t understand each other as their own languages were different .
negative	this was hugely problematic ; resulting to a lot of damage to property and significant damage to my new £_000 appliance !
negative	not impressed .
negative	first response following this on the phone was ' jobs worthy ' and disappointing but since then appliances_online have seemed to be doing the right thing .
negative	i will review again when damage dealt_with .
negative	perhaps expert logistics who provide the delivery deserve this review more .
negative	i cannot fathom how on earth it went so wrong !
negative	wanted to return an item - mailed it back with all the papers .
negative	they returned the " return " to me by mail about 0 months later - postage due !
negative	a note said i did not process the return correctly ; i needed a return code .
negative	i then tried to get a return code and they refused as the time period for making a return had expired .
negative	do not use this service
negative	i received the wrong goods and they won_'_t credit me .
negative	i '_ve been waiting a month .
negative	they don_'_t answer the phone and don_'_t seem to know what '_s going on in their own office !
negative	this was my first experience booking through bookit and it was not a good experience .
negative	0 ) i personally inputted all my personal information and my reservation has my name misspelled which caused a problem on arrival .
negative	0 ) i inputted 0 persons and names of those staying in room and it only had my name .
negative	once again this caused problem upon_arrival .
negative	the biggest disappointment was the hotel itself .
negative	the pictures must have been taken when the hotel opened because it was disgusting !!
negative	it smelled of smoke , the room was dirty ( i had to wipe counters with wipey ), the lights in hall were out .
negative	vegas rooms were cleaner than there .
negative	seems to be the answer for everything .
negative	with income exceeding $ 0 , 000 monthly i was " granted " $_000 .
negative	hardly worth the trouble .
negative	i ordered 0 bouquets , one for my mothers birthday and the other for my mother - in - laws 00th_birthday , 0 days apart .
negative	both deluxe bouquets .
negative	my mothers flowers were not in good co diction when they arrived and she threw a lot of them away after 0 days .
negative	my mother in laws arrived nearly all dead .
negative	some stems still had roots with mud on them and as she opened the package it smelt awful .
negative	she thought it was a cruel joke and was in tears !
negative	after many emails back and forth , i eventually had both bouquets resent
negative	i would never use this company again !
negative	i ordered 0 tins of exterior paint with a delivery advertised within 0 days .
negative	that was a week_ago , no sign of the order , but a text over the weekend to say that they were very busy and i should expect delivery within the next 0 working days .
negative	i '_ve therefore missed a weekend and the time i took off work this week to get the painting done .
negative	really poor service and they certainly haven_'_t provided the advertised service .
negative	i had used the home delivery as the ruislip store is chaos whatever time of day you go .
negative	lesson_learnt and i '_ll spend the time travelling to b_& q in future !
negative	worst online shopping_experience in my life so_far .
negative	this company is fake and should be shutdown .
negative	i am still_waiting i will review if i ever get them
negative	it was really annoying that i could not use my hilton honors account to book the reservation .
negative	# 0 - had to spend 00_minutes giving information that could have been looked up in two seconds .
negative	# 0 - am i going to get credit for having my hhonors in the system ?
negative	the dude wouldn_'_t even take it .
negative	# 0 - pure crap !
negative	!
negative	i telephoned simplysupplements and my call was answered by gemma .
negative	i explained that i had had problems changing my password on the website and could i order by phone .
negative	she said she would reset by password as if i ordered on the phone i would not get free delivery .
negative	she did not ask what i was ordering so did not know the amount of i was paying .
negative	i said i would try to reset my password because of this .
negative	i am 00 yrs_old and do not fully understand the ins and outs of the internet so could not reset my password .
negative	i wanted to get the order sent off today , so i telephoned again , and gemma answered , i told her i would try to reset my password later , but could she take my order on the phone , as in the brochure as i was paying 00_pounds i would be entitled to free delivery anyway .
negative	she gave a big sigh , so i told her if she did not want to take my order , perhaps her supervisor could .
negative	she then_proceeded to take my order .
negative	after many years ordering from simple supplements i was very upset by this .
negative	i am not well myself so this was added stress for me which i am not able to take .
negative	i can_honestly say in the past your telephone advisors have been more than helpful when i have had to telephone to place an order .
negative	i would not give gemma any stars at all for the stress she gave_me this morning when all i wanted to do was spend some money with your company .
negative	please excuse any spelling mistakes if i have made any .
negative	after looking again on the website i understand i have to give a star so i give one very reluctantly .
negative	the part they sent me was used , and i paid for a brand_new one !
negative	i can '_t get my printer to acknowledge the inkfarm cartridge so it looks like i just waster my money .
negative	i am appalled at the way i was treated by this company .
negative	i originally ordered prescription_sunglasses for this site .
negative	when they arrived , they were the wrong ones .
negative	it turned_out that they had mistakenly shipped mine to another customer and theirs to me .
negative	i immediately received a garbled email and phone_call asking if i had the wrong pair of glasses .
negative	okay , sometimes companies make mistakes .
negative	however , the company then sent me several very rude demanding emails asking me to package the glasses up , send them back , and somehow include the receipt for the shipping so they could refund me my money .
negative	i let them know this was not convenient for me , as i work during all hours the post_office was open except for saturdays .
negative	this interaction took place on a monday and i heard_nothing from the company .
negative	on thursday and friday i then received a shipping label and a subsequent pushy and rude email_asking me to send it out right_away .
negative	i hadn_'_t even gotten the original email with the shipping code yet as they sent it in the early hours of the morning .
negative	all in all , i '_ve never had such terrible customer_service , or rude obnoxious emails from a company .
negative	i will never shop_here again .
negative	first at all i realy dont_know how you dare to ask us something , after you let us such a bad coments !!!
negative	?
negative	the second one , trust me we are very kind with people special with are guest and you dont do part of anione of this
negative	two categori , for me it was beter cause you lost in that night , cause i work veri hard to get a good coments for my guest
negative	i try to do all my best for they to have a nice stayng at us , the point is cause i dont_know the hotel and ifven if i now posibile dont tell you .
negative	have a good luck and try to be more kind in the future pls .. take_care bye

negative	i arranged for flowers to be sent to my sister - in - laws birthday which was on a sunday .
negative	they were actually delivered a day late when she was at work , they were left out on the door_step in the snow without the card that i had asked to be included so she had no_idea who they were from when she got home to a very sorry looking bouquet !
negative	i emailed to complain on the tuesday but didn_'_t even get an acknowledgement that they had been received .
negative	i telephoned them on the thursday but kept getting answerphone .
negative	when i finally got through , i was told that they could resend the flowers or it would take up to 0 days for the escalation team to respond about a possible refund .
negative	absolutely horrendous service experience .
negative	don_'_t use them - pay a little more for interflora and know that you will at_least get what you pay for !
negative	ordered two bags of food on line and waited 0 days for my delivery , after i received a confirmation of my order .
negative	when nothing arrived and i called to find out what was going on , i was told my money had been refunded as the food was out of stock .
negative	maybe some_sort of notification would have been nice , an_apology , something ........ even an_apology !
negative	i will stick with petco who always deliver within 00_hours of my order .
negative	when i ordered it said it would be shipped next_day and it did not ship until 0 - 0 days_later .
negative	the shippin tracking they sent never worked and there sizes are way toooo small i usually wear a xl i ordered a 0x and it doesn_'_t fit and i have no_clue how to return it !
negative	the confirmation stated i should receive my order in 0 to 0 days .
negative	i have not received it after a week .
negative	where is my order ??
negative	?
negative	i ordered a part and they cancelled with no notification .
negative	will never order from you again .
negative	booked a room and traveled for 00_hours .
negative	when we went in with a valid reservation number - he hampton_inn told me .
negative	have no room and reservation conter over sold this by 0 rooms that night .
negative	we had to spend 0 hours finding a room that night and got to sleep 0 am .
negative	shame on your company that told me " great news - we are going to refund all your money ".
negative	really pay me back for a room i didn_'_t stay in because you don_'_t know how to set valid confermations .
negative	i will never use this again and will do my best to help others a aid using you services as we '_ll .
negative	j
negative	still_waiting for refund over a month since item returned !
negative	i '_ve been to mavis before for this and i ' d thought they wouldn_'_t gouge me , but they did .
negative	i went in for a nys inspection on a 0 year_old car , and when i was called later to be told it was finished , they recommended i get a power_steering flush and upgraded wiper_blades .
negative	i declined , and the guys response was that these are necessary to pass the inspection and i was required to do it .
negative	thinking they wouldn_'_t pass my car it i didn_'_t do this things , i agreed and then came in to find they put $_00 wiper_blades on my car and the power_steering flush was $_00 .
negative	i will not be coming_back for future service .
negative	i had the very bad surprise to find out after a little more than a year that my marble slate was of very bad quality .
negative	not using it very much and never for a long time , in a few_days , it was covered with a lot of holes in the stone where the water digs up very quickly .
negative	i thought that this problem would be considered as a hidden defect and of course , the soothing company would replace the slab , but surprisingly , the manufacturer covered himself behind the warranty which ended only few_months_ago .
negative	$ 0 , 000 for a piece of junk !
negative	very mad and disappointed !
negative	i will never buy anything anymore from this company !
negative	no costumer_service at all !!!
negative	no one answers your emails and there is no number to contact them .
negative	shipping takes so long too .
negative	order else where .!
negative	!
negative	order was placed on 00 / 0 and have not received any further communication after saying the order was being_processed .
negative	since then nothing altho the orginal email said i would be notified as soon as the gift_cards were sent .
negative	please explain
negative	i '_ve been shopping at yesstyle . com for a couple years_now and i always loved it .
negative	the site is so easy to use , they have the cutest_clothes , and i would wait three or four days and my clothes would be in my closet , waiting to be worn .
negative	the last two orders i '_ve placed haven_'_t been the most pleasant experiences .
negative	the issue with the prior one was that my items took nearly a week and a half to get to me , despite_being shipped a day and a half after i placed the order ( and all the items were on a one or two day wait to be shipped and were shipped after a day and a half ).
negative	the other issue was that my card was overcharged !
negative	the latest order came quickly after the wait ( this item was on a seven to fourteen day wait to be shipped , so it was understandable ), but it was the wrong item !
negative	it was similar , but it wasn_'_t what i ordered .
negative	i looked up the item i received and lo and behold , it didn_'_t exist .
negative	and once again , my card was overcharged !
negative	if this is yesstyle '_s new constant , i will take my business to a fabric store and make my own clothes .
negative	update 0 / 0 / 00 : on top of everything that '_s already gone wrong with this order , i had to pay to send the wrong item back to them !
negative	yes , for some_reason , i am paying for their mistake .
negative	wtf .
negative	and the overcharge ?
negative	yeah , that '_ll only be fixed if they get a copy of my bank_statement .
negative	they could just go look at it themselves and see what they did wrong .
negative	i am more than displeased with this .
negative	really .
negative	this is what they call customer_service ?
negative	i would give this zero_stars if i could .
negative	order guaranteed for christmas won_'_t be making it in time .
negative	so , so mad .
negative	impossible to speak to an actual_person for customer_service .
negative	ordering from this website was a mistake , to do a return is taking far too long and will probably take longer to recieve my money back .
negative	horrible and a real inconvinience to me .
negative	i was sent an automatic message that my order was out of stock and would be shipped shortly .
negative	i am living in the country w_/ o transportation therefore cannot just go to the store .
negative	i ran_out of food for my dogs while waiting for the order to be stocked and shipped .
negative	i sent a message asking what was taking so long and at that time was told that the size of the particular_brand i order ( pedigree ) was no_longer carried in that size so would i change to a different size so my order could be processed .
negative	i did this and my order was shipped .
negative	why wasn_'_t i asked this originally instead of being told it was out of stock and would ship soon ?
negative	if i had not followed_up myself i would still be waiting .
negative	very disappointing as i had to feed my dogs brown_rice while waiting for their food .
negative	we paid $_000 canadian for a 0 door compact car for 0_weeks in france .
negative	the car was picked_up and dropped_off in different_locations in france but not at an airport .
negative	i was told that the only charges on drop_off would be for the two extra drivers 00_euros x0 and 00 . 00_euros road tax which totals 000 . 00_euros .
negative	at a conversion rate of 0 . 00 that would be $_000 cdn .
negative	on july_0th my visa was charged a whopping $_000 . 00 more canadian dollars on top ofthe original rental fee of $_000 cdn .
negative	i have not received any itemised account of why you would charge more than double the agreed_upon return car charges .
negative	pls .
negative	contact me immediately .
negative	i am very disatisfied with your company .
negative	dont ever use this crowd .
negative	i sent 0 parcels on different dates .
negative	0 arrived , 0 is lost and the others are still sitting in the shop i drop them at and 0 days have passed .
negative	customers emailing constantly wanting money returned and no wonder .
negative	ive got no answers for them .
negative	no way of contacting this crowd without costing more money .
negative	the 00 assistance chat called millie gets back after 0 day , or so they claim .
negative	never , never never use this crowd .
negative	i '_ve never booked a hotel through priceline until recently .
negative	i usually use alternative discount travel sites .
negative	got to the hotel after driving for hours ( and pregnant and with a toddler ) and they claim they only have one of my reservations .
negative	i had the itinerary clearing stating two and they told me to deal with it through priceline .
negative	called them , got the back and forth for over an_hour !
negative	finally they " figured it out " but stated that bc if pricelines screw up that the room won_'_t be ready for another three hours .
negative	then tried to just cancel the room and of course priceline would let us nor did they offer any sort of consolation .
negative	not impressed !
negative	signed_up and receieved a bill which stated " paid in full ".
negative	granted it allowed for extra_fees for city taxes etc .
negative	this came to roughly 000 $ extra .
negative	wrote to them via_e_- mail - no response .
negative	finally after being told no problem with returning car to avalon airport , returning car full and with no damage we got another bill for about 00 $.
negative	wrote again but again no response .
negative	would not rent again from this outfit .
negative	this company will make you pay for their error .
negative	i ordered one part , they charged me for two , then wanted me to pay return shipping and a restocking_fee for their error .
negative	their customer_service was appallingly unprofessional .
negative	after this incident , i looked up reviews online and found reference to many similar incidences on yelp and yahoo .
negative	arrived home to see a card for delivery of a table lamp i ordered , it said it had been left in a green box outside my house , i don_'_t have a green box !!!
negative	also on line it said it had been posted through my letter_box , a table lamp ?
negative	i don_'_t think so , i have rung twice and no one has come_back to me ....
negative	crap !!
negative	!
negative	we booked our hotel room 0 months before our trip .
negative	0 nights side ocean_view and a full kitchen .
negative	i never got a confirmation_email but a few_days after booking the first nights stay was taken from my bank_account ( didn_'_t know this was happening ) but didn_'_t question it because it was an expense out of the way .
negative	figured we were good to go !
negative	my family of 0 ( 0_adults 0 kids ) drive 0 hours for vacation .
negative	get here to only have the side_view and shorted us a day of our stay .
negative	we ended_up having to pay an extra $_000 for another nights stay .
negative	come to our room and we have no kitchen just a small fridge .
negative	we call expedia .
negative	on the phone for 0 hours and hung_up on 0 times .
negative	we were left with no answers out $_000 and no way to cook for our family .
negative	i will never again book with this company they are absolutely horrible !
negative	the only_thing they succeed at was to ruin my first day of vacation !
negative	it '_s been over a week since i ordered a gift_card and i still have no card and no shipping verification or tracking_number .
negative	i '_ve emailed customer_service twice asking for information and have received no response whatsoever .
negative	i will not use this company again and would never recommend them to anyone !
negative	i was very excited to receive the kraken rum and free kraken tumblr as it was meant to be a gift , however all i received was a box full of shattered glass and a big mess to clean up .
negative	it did have packing peanuts but somehow the bottle and glass were broken before i ever got to open the box .
negative	i don_'_t know if i '_ll try ordering again , though i know it '_s most_likely the postal service '_s fault
negative	i had the option of staying with orange or going with 0 .
negative	i ' d been with orange on an iphone_0gs for about 00 months and never had any_problems but when upgrading to an iphone_0s so many colleagues complained_about orange customer_service that i decided to go with 0 .
negative	i '_m so glad that i did .
negative	trying to unlock my iphone_0gs has_been extremely problematic .
negative	i contacted customer_services 0 times , each person saying sorry the request hadn_'_t been carried out , ' trust me ' i '_ll process the request , before getting through to someone_who did actually process it , only to be told that only one person processes the requests , 0 times a week , and it '_s going to take 00 days to process the request - well over a month where i can '_t use a phone that i own .
negative	prior to this i was an orange customer for about 00 years , with a gap of a few_years while i was living_abroad .
negative	i wouldn_'_t consider returning to orange , and couldn_'_t in good faith recommend orange , which is unfortunate as i work for a company that sells products with the orange network , fortunately we have other choices .
negative	very , very poor customer_service , orange , very disappointing .
negative	clearly no quality control , netball ring corroded and paint flacking off .
negative	okay i rented a textbook from them last semester and they don_'_t offer a portion back even if it '_s in good condition ( other_places do ).
negative	then i just sent them a book ( sold my old book to them i mean ) bought this past january and it was in excellent condition and only used a few_times .
negative	i bought it for $_000 .
negative	they didn_'_t answer an_email i sent and didn_'_t make it clear of fees or the possible sell back prices or how it works ...... nothing .
negative	do you know i just got an_email_saying i '_m being sent a check for $ 0 .
negative	like seriously , i could '_ve at_least sold it on ebay for $_00 .
negative	rip_off , i don_'_t even recommend renting from them since they ' re so shady , i '_m deactivating my account today .
negative	hostelworld used to be good .
negative	now all that matters is money .
negative	anyone can make a fake review and hw doesn_'_t care , they publish before trying to find out the truth .
negative	how can they make money leading customers to believe in anything that is published ?
negative	as a booking site they should be more acurate about reviews and publish only after having proof that things related did happen .
negative	my trust in their reviews today is 0 %
negative	ive been very dissappointed to work with trophiesandmedals . com and will not chose to work with them again .
negative	i lazily chose an online trophy company for convienince however i learnt the lesson the hard way .
negative	i will now always support my local businesses and would prefer to receive face to face advice and a friendly accommodating approach to customer_service .
negative	i run small sided leagues and purchase 000 trophies a year minimum .... any new customer is always a bonus however trophiesandmedals . com have lost out on potentially a lucrative one .
negative	none of the information i received identified them as a third_party even my confirmation .
negative	it was confusing and difficult .
negative	it has_been an awful experience and the room was very expensive .
negative	awful !
negative	i will be more careful in the future and only deal directly with the hotel .
negative	i won_'_t go into full details , however they promised us two rooms that were adjoined , even saying they called the hotel specifically ( which they didnt ) and we were out on the streets of las_vegas with two little girls at 0 : 00 at night with no rooms .
negative	they then said they wouldn_'_t credit us towards another room for our stay and further more said that they couldn_'_t give us a refund because the original hotel had the money .
negative	they said 0 different times ( even getting off the phone as if they were calling ) that they had spoke with the hotel and the hotel wouldn_'_t give us a refund .
negative	we then went down to the hotel and they said that no one from expedia had called and further more they couldn_'_t give us back the money because they don_'_t even have our card information rather they are paid by expedia and they weren_'_t holding any money .
negative	we had the manager at the hotel call expedia and they then said they would give a full_refund with in 00_hours .
negative	i had them e_- mail me in which they stated that they would give me a refund within 00_hours .
negative	it is now 00 days past with no money refunded and i have to wait on if their merchant says that they will refund the money within the next 00 days to my account .
negative	they are awful and i can '_t_believe these crooks can get away with this in america .
negative	i feel_like i '_m dealing_with a shady country from far away !!!
negative	don " t ever use them - and spread the message !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	the package arrived on time , well_wrapped , but with only 0 out of the 0 lights in working order - a situation which_meant they were totally useless for purpose .
negative	very disappointing and totally_unacceptable .
negative	i thought i had gotten a good deal but in realty i got charged too much didn_'_t realize until i was on my online_banking account .
negative	this company will not refund your money back an its a foreign company that you can easily mistaken the price an think its usa dollars when in realty is in pounds which is more in usa money they swiped all my money from my debit_card !!!
negative	i '_m so upset an unsatisfied !!
negative	hope this does not happen to anyone_else !
negative	i ordered four parts from parts_geek ; i have received three .
negative	no response from parts_geek after emailing .
negative	no phone_number available to contact them .
negative	this company needs to be put out of business for fraud .
negative	be sure to read all the reviews before ordering from this company .
negative	i think i was cheated by taunton_leisure they show on their website pictures that don_'_t match the items and when i wanted to return the item and explained the situation to them they said there was nothing they could do !
negative	when i looked that night on their website they had changed the details which was clearly because of my call !
negative	awful , waited in for 00_hrs and nobody collected the parcel .
negative	refused to give any reduction in postage_costs as it '_s not 000_% guaranteed that someone will collect ??
negative	nobody contacted us to inform us .
negative	don_'_t use !
negative	!
negative	devastated that my wedgwood dinner service is in bits .
negative	the breakages were beyond just an accident in transit .
negative	when we looked into it further we found that the driver stacked the boxes which stated fragile and knowing that there was china and glass .
negative	breakages - 0 serving plate , 0 dinner plates , 0 glasses , 0 saucer , 0 teacup , 0 coffee_cup .
negative	glasses cannot be replaced , other parts of the dinner service can be at a cost .
negative	very very disappointed with service - will never use again
negative	placed an order on 00 th december it is now 0 th january_0000 and have not recieved my order .
negative	i have not had any contact from the alzproducts in all that time .
negative	would not use these again .
negative	the flowers were supposed to be delivered on 0 march for a birthday - i even paid for a birthday card .
negative	apparently i missed the deadline for that day so i naturally thought they would be delivered the next_day !!
negative	after leaving lots of messages and receiving strange replies - there doesn_'_t seem to be any direct emails , just leave a message on the website - flowers delivered on 00 march .
negative	apparently they were lovely but not for a birthday 00 days previously .
negative	i ordered one thing , they sent something_else .
negative	no resolution , no nothing .
negative	just that they will check with the warehouse .
negative	last thing i heard .
negative	never notified when the shipment went out either .
negative	faster and more reliable sites out there .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	failed to mention that the boots i ordered for a specific event were on back order 0_weeks after i had ordered them .
negative	they are untimely , slow , stupid , and f * king suck .
negative	took them 0 days to respond to my emails .
negative	seriously reconsider ordering anything from them .
negative	you wont get it for weeeeeeeeks .
negative	i have been trying to contact claims department to file a claim , but minsy who is the only one who processes claims doesn_'_t call back or answer the phone .
negative	i have been trying to reach her for 0_weeks now and the only time she actually called after i called the main customer_service line and addressed the issue .
negative	when minsy called me the next_day but i was at work and i asked that she call me back after 0pm .
negative	she said she would call me at 0 : 00 .
negative	when i got off work at 0 , i tried to catch her , but she did not answer .
negative	no one called me at 0 : 00 or after .
negative	i called her back around 0pm and left a voicemail stating that i was upset with her service and that she is not responsible .
negative	i do a lot of my shopping online petflow is the worst company i have ever ordered from !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i received a shoe_size 0 that is clearly not a 0 contacted customer_service and they refuse to take back unless i pay for shipping i did not order a size 0 shoe customer_service needs to learn english and manners not happy with this experience at all i received a jacket that is not small but rather extremely small another item i will not be able to wear very unhappy with these items
negative	i ordered flowers for my mum for mothers_day .
negative	i live in the us and can '_t be with her so i wanted her to have something nice .
negative	i arranged for them to be delivered on saturday march_00th but they never arrived .
negative	i emailed immediately , no response .
negative	they finally arrived yesterday , 0 days late .
negative	still no reply to my email .
negative	totally_unacceptable and very unprofessional .
negative	i won_'_t be using iflowers again !
negative	i only ordered a pair of boots ( 0 . 00 ) and a pair of tights ( 0 . 00 ) and my total ends_up being 00 . 00 ( including shipping ), which was fine with me .
negative	half an_hour later , i go back to the website to see how my order is doing and for some f - uped reason my total goes from 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 ... wtf .
negative	i just ordered my things and im already hating on them .
negative	i tried to cancel but it said i can only cancel over the phone so , i tried_calling .
negative	no one picks_up then out of no where the phone_number doesnt work anymore .
negative	thanks for effing me over ami ... stupid piece of shitee !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered scrub pants put them in my cart and checked out without a problem .
negative	a week went by i emailed " where '_s my order " and didn_'_t receive a reply , another week another email this time a rude unapologetic response .
negative	" you ordered discontinued merchandise and we emailed you your order was canceled " not exactly folks .
negative	twenty_minutes after my order confirmation_email i received an_email containing a small square box titled ' credit_card void receipt ' there was no text or explaination whatsoever !
negative	this was unclear and very unprofessional as was their eventual reply .
negative	zero star_rating in my book .
negative	the package arrived dirty , bent , and damaged .
negative	the product itself looked used , and there was a yellow liquid inside the bag with the product .
negative	apparently partsgeeks does not claim responsibility for the delivery of the product .
negative	i wasn_'_t home to deny the package .
negative	i ' d suggest partsgeeks gets a new delivery carrier .
negative	i was very disappointed and would not recommend anyone to order from this website / company .
negative	i received an_email 0 days ago stating that my ties had been shipped but i have yet to receive them .
negative	i ordered an ink_cartridge and you had no problem taking my money but all i got was excuses .
negative	i gave you 0_star but only because i had to .
negative	my daughter bought a swimsuit from amiclubwear . com .
negative	it was cheaply_made and did not fit .
negative	they would not let her return it .

negative	if you see a five_star review here , it '_s a five_star lie .
negative	they buy fake reviews .
negative	i wish i could give zero_stars as that '_s what they deserve .
negative	my sister made the mistake of buying her wedding_dress from tidebuy and it was a disaster .
negative	a cheap badly made rip_off with poor sewing and cheap fabric and plastic beads .
negative	thankfully she still had three_months to find a replacement so it ended_up costing her hundreds of $$$ more than she had wanted to spend .
negative	before buying my dress i did a lot of research and found out that tidebuy . com , tidebuybridal . com , tbdress . com and other_sites are all the same so please check before you buy .

negative	i ordered a textbook with two day shipping ( as i needed it for class asap ) and had the money taken out of my bank_account .
negative	i waited for a week and tried to get in contact with the company .
negative	don_'_t bother calling the phone_number as the system is a joke .
negative	i went through the prompt to check the status of an order and accidentally entered the wrong order number and was prompted that " my order was being_processed ."
negative	i then went through the prompt again and entered the correct order number and was prompted " my order was being_processed ."
negative	you can '_t get a hold of a person through the phone .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_service and two_days_later found out my order never shipped since it was not in stock .
negative	yet , i never received a notice saying the textbook was out of stock and was charged for something i was never going to receive . a few hours after i received that response from customer_service , paypal notified me that a refund was issued from bookbyte .
negative	i feel_like if i didn_'_t contact them they would have kept my money .
negative	i don_'_t understand what is so difficult about updating a website to reflect the availability of items and having a person at the other end of a phone line .
negative	i am really upset that they charged me for an item that i was never going to receive .
negative	this is the worst company with the worst operating practices .
negative	i will never shop from this company again , and i would strongly_advise others not to either !
negative	don_'_t use these_guys for expedited services ... you won ; t get it any faster or when you need it by paying double the price .
negative	they don ; t tell you until after the fact that the 0 day service you paid for is actually a week .
negative	when you cancell the order they ignore your cancellation and you are forced to take action at your own end via your card_holder and wait for results ... in the meantime you '_ve tied up $_000 '_s of dollars waiting for a resolution .
negative	which still has not come !!
negative	!
negative	you ask the same questions over and over again .
negative	i have deleted an account yet it still comes up .
negative	i use the correct password and it accepts it on some sites but not others .
negative	i '_m done with your service .
negative	i ' d prefer to give you no stars .
negative	was hoping to go to dinner at a favorite restaurant last_week .
negative	ordered gift_cards about 00 days ahead .
negative	no sign of them yet .
negative	first time dealing_with this company , and definitely the last .
negative	have ordered from another group [_external reference_] in the meantime and those cards are already here .
negative	i ordered a top from boo_hoo . com 0_weeks before christmas .
negative	i received an_email to say the item was despatched on 00th_dec and estimated delivery was 00th_december .
negative	when my parcel had still not arrived on 00st_december i emailed boo_hoo customer_services to find out where it was .
negative	i received a reply to say it was in transit & i had to wait 00 days from the despatch date before they could investigate .
negative	on 00th_december i received an_email to tell me boo_hoo had refunded my purchase as there was no stock !!
negative	the service and customer_services has_been appalling .
negative	if there was no stock it would have been nice to know 0_weeks_ago when i still had time to purchase the item elsewhere !
negative	thanks very much boo_hoo , i won_'_t be repeating this experience shopping with you !!
negative	!
negative	the tool box that they sent was dented up and it did not fit the the truck like they said it would !
negative	i would never order from them again !
negative	i never_experienced such bad customer_service ever , i had few issues with this company .
negative	most of the items they sell have very bad quality , but when i got a few defected dresses a few_months_ago , i had to send them back !!
negative	i did this , and i got everything back !!
negative	they didn_'_t accept it and even post them back to me !!
negative	i had a lot of orders with this on - line store , because i was buying clothing for someone_else , so orders were big all the time , but anyway they didn_'_t care about me as a customer at all .
negative	even when i called them , they were rude , i promised that i won_'_t order anything_else .
negative	i wish i didn_'_t , because i placed another 0 orders recently , and guess what , they couldn_'_t supply all items i ordered , but charged me as if they sent me everything !
negative	they overcharged me for $_00 . 00 , and it '_s a week since i e_- mailed them a complain , and they still didn_'_t reply !!!
negative	( it '_s 0_weeks since they charged me !!)
negative	.
negative	now for sure i won_'_t order anything !!
negative	if i could give them less then 0_star i would !!
negative	!
negative	while the pricing is competitive their customer_service ( even supervisors ) are lacking so they won_'_t be keeping customers if they are smart
negative	all advertisment states the generic ink will work in my brother_printer as the manufactures ink that was in the printer when purchased .
negative	no it does not .
negative	notified brother and tech and myself purged the system , using all the ink and still nothing .
negative	brother is sending me 0 new ink_cartridges .
negative	when i called inkfarm for help with a refund and that the purging emptied all ink_cartridges women on the phone stated " this was imlpossible " and there is no refund for this problem .
negative	i ordered 0 dresses from this company for my friend '_s wedding .
negative	they were appallingly badly made and far far too small .
negative	the dresses were unusable .
negative	i have spent 0 months complaining and trying to get some money back .
negative	despite spending over us $_000 , the company offered me only us $_00 !!
negative	outrageous .
negative	i '_m better off selling the dresses on ebay .
negative	do not use them !!!
negative	i only clicked one star because i had to .
negative	ideally i would click none .
negative	price was deceiving , have to pay extra for seating , drinks / snacks , and even worst for carry on bag .
negative	would not recommend spirit airline , thought i was getting a bargain but all i really got was a headache .
negative	be ware .
negative	i am so disappointed in the labels i received from myownlabels . com .
negative	they looked beautiful on the computer_screen during the design process , but when they arrived there was no comparison .
negative	i understand that the colors you see on the computer_screen may not be the exact colors of the printed label , but the labels looked faded as if the printer was low on ink and some of the text was hard to see .
negative	there was supposed to be vertical pin - striping on the label , but it was only visible with a bright light and a magnifying glass .
negative	i was counting on these labels for wedding_favors .
negative	luckily i had enough time before the wedding to design and print my own_labels at home .
negative	i won_'_t order from myownlabels . com again .
negative	my reservation was cancelled without anyone telling_me .
negative	i arrived do the hotel and did not have any reservation .
negative	when i called i was told that the payment on my credit_card was pending .. not possible i shop on line all the time with this card that has no spending limit .
negative	this item was sent to me with no invoice .
negative	when my mechanic went to put the taillight on , he found that it clearly was not for 0000_mercedes e000 .
negative	it was much smaller_than the one that was on my vehicle .
negative	need to have someone arrange to pick this on up to return to you , and either issue me a full credit , including shipping and handling , and send me the proper taillight .
negative	i have your phone_number on my credit_card statement , and if i do not hear back from you , i will call you at that phone_number .
negative	please either email me or call me at 000 - 000 - 0000 as soon as possible .
negative	laurie ramsey
negative	my package did not arrive , ups shipping said it is missing when i tried_calling the seller partsgeek . com , you are disconnected by the automated_system .
negative	i also sent an_email to the sender partsgeek . com on thursday january 0 no response recieved so now i am out of $_00 and never recieved my part !
negative	the property is ok .
negative	but the managers are not very hospitable .
negative	if you need to take a rest room break you better hope you don_'_t have a real urgency or diarreah cause on this property you have to go show your face and ask permission to be let in cause the door is under constant lock and key .
negative	yeah they provide a legit concern about how vagrants dirty it up etc , but that is not acceptable for paying clients .
negative	the trash bins too they locked , we were advised that the bins were just the property use and not the paying client , so if you have trash like regulat trash you have to bring your own trash bag etc .
negative	not feeling happy here but have no choice for now but will move in a heart_beat where it is nice and managers dont make you feel_like you a nuisance for asjing them to open the bathroom or borrow the trash can for small trash
negative	i purchased speedo swimsuit and jacket for my 00 year_old_son through his school .
negative	he is a boys size large .
negative	i relied on the size_chart .
negative	the items that were shipped were so small , you couldn_'_t fit a 0 year_old in them !
negative	he never wore them once .
negative	i called the company so many_times and was told , " too bad " because he had them monogrammed .
negative	the sizes were so off that i can only think they are knock_offs .
negative	i spend something like $_000 for both items and got no use out of them .
negative	so many parents complained of the same problem .
negative	essentially , i got ripped_off !
negative	the school was unable to negotiate any assistance for us .
negative	the worst service i have ever_experienced in any retail_store anywhere !
negative	!
negative	i am unable to review the product as i have not received my order yet .
negative	i purchased a suction shower_head holder that was advertised as easy to fit and fits most standard shower heads .
negative	i have a standrad showerhead and the product failed to support it , nor did it stick on the wall .
negative	no instructions were provided .
negative	i will need to return the product for a refund .
negative	i bought a bcbs plan through ehealth .
negative	i am pregnant and will deliver at mt . sinai hospital , nyc .
negative	i needed a plan that would be specifically accepted at mt . sinai .
negative	i was assured by ehealth and mt . sinai that bcbs would be accepted .
negative	after i bought the plan , i was told by mt . sinai ( and other doctors ) that they do not accept the specific plan i had because it was " part of the exchange ."
negative	i called bcbs to confirm this and could never get through to anyone by phone .
negative	i waited an average of one hour on hold and was transferred 0 - 0 times and never got through to anyone_who could answer my question .
negative	i called ehealth , who looked into it with bcbs , and ehealth told me that the plan is not on the exchange .
negative	i also called mt . sinai , they called bcbs for me , and were told that the plan is on the exchange , and therefore , not accepted at mt . sinai .
negative	this was a major inconvenience for me , and a waste of time and money .
negative	i paid for a month of insurance that i could not use .
negative	furthermore , in that one month , i had one ultrasound with a doctor who does accept the bcbs plan i had and bcbs has sent me an invoice basically billing me for the doctor '_s fees saying that it is part of my out of pocket deductible .
negative	this for a plan that i have had to cancel because it is actually useless to me .
negative	in march i had no insurance .
negative	i had to look for and purchase a new insurance plan .
negative	i am very disappointed with my experience with ehealth and definitely would not recommend it to anyone .
negative	petflow is very disappointing for the second time in the few_months i have ordered from them .
negative	i tried to call many_times about an order i placed and got no responses .
negative	i sent the order back and still got no response .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i am waiting for a refund .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend petflow to anyone .
negative	i was misled to think it was the hotel i was speaking with , then when i got to hotel they quoted a much lower_rate but could not get it because expedia won_'_t do that .
negative	i did not like anything i bought ughh
negative	i am hoping that i can update this with a great review upon recieving but would have expected it a week_later even with monday being a holiday .
negative	when ordering my necklace , i did not receive confirmation until i asked for it several_times .
negative	shipping took much longer_than_anticipated .
negative	now that i am trying to return the necklace within the 00 day window , my emails have gone unanswered .
negative	i suspect they are waiting until the 00 days is up and then will refuse the return .
negative	i tried posting on the facebook_page and my post was instantly deleted and i was removed from the page .
negative	interesting .
negative	seems this company goes to great lengths to make_sure there is only positive_feedback about them on the web .
negative	the total uncool conn shop to use
negative	i ordered present for my 0 years old_son from the cool shop on 0 - 00 - 00 contacted them 00 - 00 - 00 , sent parcel_force tracking ref the parcel hadn_'_t left denmark contact parcel_force on 00 - 00 - 00 ref was invalid , sent several e_- mails to coolshop no replies 00 - 00 - 00 , had virutal chat with them got full out a claims form !!!!

negative	what conn the sender should full in claims form not the buyer , please beware parcel_force are not responsible for the parcel until on uk soil , would never use again , now going have 0 very unhappy 0 year_old on xmas day with no xmas_present :-(
negative	item arrived 00 - 00 - 00 smashed box , returned which itemed 00 - 00 - 00 signed for by the cool shop , guess what no refund !!!!!
negative	now on 00 - 00 - 00 , as for that idoit martin who '_s replied my e_- mails he should get the sack .
negative	i shall reporting to trading standard , these cowboy '_s need stopping :-(
negative	my brother died suddenly in an accident and i had to return home .
negative	after advising the customer_service rep of this they asked for his gp to fill_out a form and i advised he wasn_'_t sick , he died suddenly after falling into a canal and drowned and was taken directly to the morgue .
negative	i advised the request was ridiculous and was told by the agent ' there '_s nothing to get upset about '.
negative	this was after i explained i had just lost my brother .
negative	at this point i refused to deal with this person any further and asked for a manager who has_been professional and helpful but this doesn_'_t change the upset caused by the first agent .
negative	i booked a king - sized bed room that is handicap_accessible and on the first floor .
negative	got to the hotel , did not have the room that i booked .
negative	instead i got a non_- handicap_accessible room on the second floor .
negative	the wheelchair barely fit through the elevator door .
negative	the desk associate offered us what he said was the hotel '_s only handicap_accessible room , which was on the first floor , but so full of furniture that the wheelchair could not be used in the room .
negative	there was an armoire , no closet , there was a dresser , there were also a large bench , a table , two chairs , and the bedside_tables .
negative	it also was the smallest queen sized bed i have ever_seen .
negative	the next_day , room service arrived while i was showering and my husband asked them to come_back later .
negative	no one came back .
negative	when i inquired at the front_desk , i was told that we would not have service , that my husband said not to come_back - not true .
negative	one employee did finally offer to do the room .
negative	my husband could not shower or bath because , although there were handrails in the tub , there were no handholds outside the tub area and no inserts or a place for towels outside the tub .
negative	i could not get a copy of my bill from the front_desk .
negative	i ordered from forever00 . com on sunday october 00 expecting my order to arrive by friday or saturday .
negative	i checked my tracking and it says that my order will not arrive until november 0 !!!!
negative	how is this even possible ??
negative	a whole month and some days .
negative	that '_s ridiculous .
negative	i needed this for friday .
negative	if i had have read on the site that it would take so long i would have looked somewhere_else for my merchandise .
negative	instead of thinking i have found what i needed and no_longer need to look anywhere_else , because i will have it in time .
negative	i am very disappointed .
negative	even if this is a glitch in the system and i won_'_t receive the package until october 0 i am still disappointed .
negative	i would not have expected it to take that long seeing as how it was shipped the very next_day .
negative	it seems like another shipping method was used and not fedex .
negative	it shouldn_'_t take over a week to ship ground via_fedex .
negative	as of today , october 00 , i have yet to receive a refund from forever 00 .
negative	i have called twice since then regarding the pack .
negative	the first time i called the day they received it to make_sure that i would receive a refund .
negative	i was told yes and that i should wait 0 - 0 business day .
negative	so i waited .
negative	then i called again after the 0 days and asked about it .
negative	i was told to wait 0 - 0 business days .
negative	i called again today and they told me that the refund was never logged .
negative	i talked with a supervisor to express to him how i felt about the situation and how this never should have happened if i '_ve called twice .
negative	he showed no concern for my issue and just rushed me off the phone .
negative	this was an awful experience .
negative	there is no way it should take a hole month to get a refund from a company .
negative	i am so annoyed with forever 00 . com .
negative	i will never order with them again .
negative	i normally have a great experience with bookbyte but this was the worst ever .
negative	i have been trying to contact someone to return a book before it was too late to receive a full_refund , but it seemed as if i was being drug along .
negative	i had the book in my possession and i was told that the book hadn_'_t arrived to me and that when i got it i could return it .
negative	i had the book in possession and now it '_s beyond my full_refund day and i am highly upset now that i know i will not receive my full_refund it i return this book .
negative	my box was missing a pair of shoes when i received it .
negative	i called and was told that i would be refunded for the price of the shoes and that there was going to be a case opened up with the carrier .
negative	as far as i know i never received the refund and i never_heard_anything back about the carrier .
negative	i ordered a timing_belt kit for my car for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i called the dealer to confirm the engine size 0 . 0l and when i ordered the part the website said it would fit .
negative	it didn_'_t .
negative	i contacted parts_geek to let them know that their website is wrong and pretty_much they did nothing .
negative	the mechanic had taken the car apart when it was discovered that the this timing_belt was the wrong_size so i ended_up going to napa and getting the correct sized belt .
negative	when i contacted partsgeek to let them know their website is incorrect , this is my actual response : " please accept our sincere apologies for failing to provide you with the excellent service you expected from us ."
negative	a pathetic canned response , like hmmmm lets give her response # 0 .
negative	no personal_touch no way to contact them via phone .... pretty_much i would never buy anything from them again ............ if you need parts go to napa or on line car - stuff better customer_service and they actually seem like they care .
negative	i purchased these led_clip on lights so i could see my dogs when i let them out at night .
negative	it seemed like agreat deal , you got 0 for less_than $ 0 . 00 .
negative	when i finally got the product i was pissed that only one of the lights actually works .
negative	if it wasn_'_t such a pain to ship it back for a refund i would but for the actual $ 0 it '_s not worth it .
negative	i won_'_t order anything_else from them again though .
negative	the company was called petflow .
negative	beware of that company and their very cheap products .
negative	we ordered two cards to give to clients as gifts .
negative	used the logo for our conference as the graphic and paid the postage so we ' d get them in plenty of time for giving .
negative	paid the bill , and two_weeks_later , no cards , but an_email_asking us to respond to this survey to tell them " how we did ".
negative	called customer_service number who informed us that the graphic was unacceptable and the cards never got printed ... we never got a call from them , or an_email_telling us that .. we had to call them to find out that we can '_t use a logo .
negative	will ever use them again .
negative	and ... any business_owner should steer_clear of this operation unless they want to , as we did , disappoint our clients .
negative	i bought a car from drive time and i am having to put money into repairs , every time i call to find out what is covered_under the warranty i am told that it is not covered , i have had problems from the fuel system , oil leaking , electrical problems with sun roof , struts and now my car alarm is not working and all this will have to be paid out of pocket .
negative	i truly would not recommend drive time to anybody i work with or any family_members as they are a big headache
negative	i submitted my order on - line and received an e_- mail the next_day telling_me that there was a problem with it and it had been placed on hold .
negative	apparently , your system is unable to fill an order if the billing_address is different from the shipping address .
negative	a money order was requested but i felt it was an unnecessary request - calling mastercard would '_ve confirmed the shipping address as acceptable even_though different from the billing_address .
negative	i decided to place my order elsewhere where they were far more accommodating .
negative	my wife , my infant child , and i all started our travel on july 0 .
negative	san_francisco caused delays due to taxi issues and caused us to miss our connecting_flight .
negative	we had to stay in houston air port on a bench because they refused to pay for us a hotel room because it wasn_'_t maintenance related , even_though it wasn_'_t our fault we missed the flight .
negative	the uso closes at 0000 .
negative	i am military and i would expect for the uso , expecially at a major airport to be open 00_hours for military convenience .
negative	the airport refused to give us cots even_though the airport had them to sleep on .
negative	i think it is very inconvenient for military and families traveling with infant children .
negative	i am dissatisfied with united_airlines and houston airport '_s customer_service .
negative	also , my wife left her goodie on the plane and we emailed them right_away and still no reply .
negative	i personally think it would be easier to just talk to someone in the phone .
negative	it is too easy to disregard an_email .
negative	i could not believe that i ordered this item for my nephew for christmas and could not have it sent directly to him .
negative	i had to go through so much bull that i canceled the order .
negative	during the entire purchase process there was something .
negative	the first time i went in i asked about holding a down payment check for up to 00 days after doing an application and choosing a vehicle , cause i know of places that do this for the customer .
negative	my salesman told me that this might be possible and would check with the loan guy .
negative	he came back and said that they could only hold a check for up to 0 week .
negative	now my sales_person obviously already knew this and wasn_'_t upfront , like most instances .
negative	finally decided to do the layaway that they have .
negative	all the sales_person told me was they could hold it until i was ready to pick it up .
negative	i then got a call on a weekly_basis which was unnecessary .
negative	0 phone_call they verified when i was picking_up the vehicle and all the sudden they needed more money cause they said they can only hold it for 0_weeks , which i clearly discussed 00 days from day 0 .
negative	so i reluctantly put more money down .
negative	during that call we discussed exactly when i would come in .
negative	the day before i was too come in i got a call asking the same question by the same person .
negative	as if they had a careless memory .
negative	i recieved a voice_mail for this call and returned the call and my sales_person acted as if he had no_clue who i was giving me a generic spiel about if i am still interested in purchasing and if there was a type of vehicle i was interested in , this was after giving my full name and returned the call the same day .
negative	i finally made it to my pick_up date and was told it would not take long just to sign and what not .
negative	i even got insurance set_up on my way there .
negative	so i got there and did the vehicle check updated everything to state that days date and re initialed everything .
negative	i was then told my down payment was higher_than initially agreed as if he had no memory of it , which took a co signer to get it down , the whole reason for adding a co .
negative	i then was told that there was a new promotion that involved paying more even_though the promo offered was still good .
negative	when i asked how it would benefit me i was told it wouldn_'_t and then_proceeded to tell me they are " out " of the orig promo and would have to call upper mgmt to get another one approved ... by then i told them i was going to walk .
negative	finally getting to the payment date when previously called wad advised to come in that day so the due date would work .
negative	they tried to give me a sooner date on a week that want even my payday !
negative	after that there was a " system malfunction " and day there for at_least an hr waiting .. all so i would have to set_up auto pay when i could have easily done that at home .
negative	0 hrs later i finally was able to leave .
negative	this whole_process should have only taken an hr tops but since they were only interested in meeting quota since it was the end of the month i was definately not priority .
negative	they were only interested in themselves and not ashamed to be outright about it .. not buying from them again ... too painful and unnecessary !!!
negative	!
negative	i think this is a poor way to make cusomers feel_confident about the service you provide .
negative	particularly those of us who have been a victim of identity_theft .
negative	my purpose for getting this service was to monitor my credit and public record transactions as well as build my credit .
negative	i '_m told when i call that our ssn numbers are similar and that is why i keep seeing someone_elses information on my account .
negative	i just don_'_t like the fact that i '_m paying you to help me guard my identity and someone_elses name contstantly appears on my account !
negative	it feels_like an invasion of my privacy !
negative	i would think that a company as large as yours would have the means to fix this problem .
negative	i will say that other than this issue i have not had any other problems with your service , but i will be closing my account !
negative	i was sent cases of cat_food that i ordered that had a " best by " date of 0 days after the day it arrived .
negative	this stuff is old .
negative	even the label on the can was an outdated label .
negative	to the credit of customer_service - they couldn_'_t have been nicer and credited me for my purchase immediately .
negative	so , that was very well handled .
negative	but knowing about the poor quality of merchandise they ' re shipping out , i wouldn_'_t order anything from them again ... especially something i '_m feeding my pets .
negative	we flew business class to amsterdam and had a terrible experience , rude flight crew , broken seats , and over - cooked awful food .
negative	but our flight home , economy , was just fine .
negative	helpful flight crew and better food ....
negative	we won_'_t fly klm again , but if you do , don_'_t spend the money for business class !
negative	i am not sure how this company stays in business .
negative	from the very first contact when my vet '_s office had to fax the prescription to this company 0 times in 0 days until their last incredibly dangerous act of incompetence i have never worked with a company so lacking in customer_service and quality control measures .
negative	the final straw occurred when my critically important package of insulin for my diabetic dog arrived at my home with the wrong name , address , dog '_s name , dosing instructions etc .
negative	i pray that the person_who received my dog '_s order did not give their dog an incorrect / lethal dose of insulin .
negative	unacceptable service throughout .
negative	the hotel was very clean though old but on friday and saturday nights it was hookersville .
negative	we even had one come knock on our door in error .
negative	there is a night club across the street and early saturday we heard gun shots and friday_night and sunday_morning there were numerous police vehicles and an ambulance at the night club .
negative	was very happy my husband was with me as i just did not feel very safe .
negative	i fly many airlines but this experience with delta had to be the worst ever !
negative	i am sure delta knew like everyone else there was a bad storm approaching and instead of canceling my entire trip , they insisted my flights were on time and left me stranded in atlanta with no where to go .
negative	never again delta
negative	i placed an order for 0 white chaise lounge pool chairs on may 00th , 0000 .
negative	i received my order confirmation in my email shortly_thereafter , and in that confirmation , the company verified the amount of the purchase at $_000 . 00 total .
negative	shipping was clearly indicated to be free , which is why i ordered through your company .
negative	by may 00st , the funds were taken from my bank_account , in the amount of $_000 . 00 .
negative	in my conversations with customer_service , i was told that this is what the manufacturer charges for shipping and my product is coming directly from the manufacturer .
negative	frankly , i don_'_t care .
negative	i ordered from you based on free_shipping ... your price for the product was competitive with others , but the free_shipping sold me on your company .
negative	now , you ' re trying to say i have to pay shipping .
negative	you cannot advertise one thing ( like free_shipping ) and then do the opposite .
negative	my other complaint is that i have yet to receive my chairs , or an_email_confirming shipment , although your customer_service dept .
negative	told me they were shipped on may 00st ....... three_days ago .
negative	finally , i also ordered a free catalogue and i have not received anything .
negative	all in all , my review gives your company an " f " at this point .... every element of my transaction has_been negative .
negative	holding $ 0 , 000 on my account and no trip booked .
negative	called to have the funds released after being transferred twice and waiting 0 hours on hold " sorry that department is closed ".
negative	nice , bet they were open an_hour ago .
negative	can you take my information and forward it to the correct department so they can call me back ( you know so i don_'_t grow old on hold )...." ummm we only take calls " the top travel_agent company can '_t send emails ???
negative	really ???
negative	sounds legit .
negative	best line ever " we understand your frustration and want to resolve this for you but we can '_t ".
negative	wow !!
negative	thanks for your awesome help today !
negative	seriously hope me or my family don_'_t have an_emergency because we have no access to our account until these funds are released ...
negative	pretty great feeling !
negative	i will never again use fed_ex .
negative	my part still has not arrived .
negative	it is sitting a state away .
negative	the fed_ex office actually had the balls to call me yesterday and ask me to come get it .
negative	when i told them it was a car part , that i could not drive my car until i had it , they told me to ask a friend or neighbor to come get it .
negative	wow , really ?
negative	better solution fed_ex - get your head out of your ass and learn how to deliver
neutral	the tennis top i ordered arrived in a plastic_bag with no packaging around it , and it looked like a rag stuffed in a heap in the corner of the bag .
neutral	this is a present so i will have to try to improve the appearance before i can give it .
neutral	when i received the package one of the bags
neutral	of kitty_litter was opened and all over the box
neutral	ordered the tutti bambini louis seligh cotbed and was told a text would be sent on day of delivery .
neutral	no text was sent but i received a call when the driver was 00mins away .
neutral	the driver had to deliver to my nans address ( 00 year_old disabled woman ).
neutral	she_lives on the 0st_floor in a block of flats and the driver refused to carry the items up .
neutral	after a argument and alot of time wasting 0 gentleman that saw what was happening had to come over and carry the boxes upstairs to my grandmother - these were extrememly heavy .
neutral	i complained via_email to precious_little_ones and although they apologised i was informed that it is their company policy that drivers are not to enter property and are not insured for a driver hurting themself carrying items upstairs - surely this should be put on their website next to big heavy items ?!?!
neutral	didnt make_sense to me at all
neutral	first time buyer here .
neutral	thought i ' d try it before_committing and glad i did .
neutral	good service and choices .
neutral	however , the prices for fancy_feast were higher_than most and the box of minced turkey had mostly dented_cans .
neutral	disappointed in that .
neutral	i used to buy monthly from another site but they did away with the fancy_feast .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for the ' target practice ' on the case of cat_food , i would likely buy again but still looking for lowest_prices and best quality .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	( i did not throw the cans out because they weren_'_t bubbled tops and can '_t afford to buy more so i thank_god they seem to be ok . lower prices , would help .
neutral	i have ordered with partsgeek several_times their prices and delivery times were right on , until my last order , where the wrong part was picked and sent to me , there is no phone_number to call to talk to a live_person and their returns and customer_service communications are only done by email , in which you recieve a rma to ship the part back at your expence , then wait for a credit , in the mean time you have to re order the part , pay for it ( even_though it was their mistake ) and hope the right one is sent to you .
neutral	that is not great customer_service . and is risky business .
neutral	i bought this top for the gym i am usually size 00 / 00 but found the medium too big changed for the small and that was still too big , strange !!
neutral	!
neutral	at_least with soactive it is easy to return at no extra_cost .
neutral	the website is good , and there is also a good variety of products , but i find that most of the products are very expensive , and can be bought for much_cheaper on english health store websites .
neutral	my local_pharmacy molloys lifestyle pharmacy and healthstore , now sells almost all products that evergreen sells , but at cheaper prices .
neutral	i also like to support my local business .
neutral	everything was fine until we cancelled a reservation we made on march 00 , 0000 , for 0nights at the hard rock hotel .
neutral	we cancelled by mistake then an_hour later tried to reinstate the reservation .
neutral	we then got hit with a cancellation_fee and could not get the same room with king_size bed .
neutral	i believe late fees could have been waived .
neutral	i love this company for its prices and variety .
neutral	never needed cs so can '_t attest to that . unfortunately , the shipping time is ridiculous .
neutral	everytime i order , it takes a week to even ship out and get a tracking_#.
neutral	its almost worth paying the extra dollar on a product .
neutral	everyone else i order from gets it to me in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i think the item i ordered was too pricey .
neutral	i liked my service from petflow , and i received my order very quickly .
neutral	it was also convenient .
neutral	their prices are pretty good , and my cat_litter is cheaper there .
neutral	the only_thing that i was dissatisfied with was my coupon .
neutral	i received a coupon in the mail ( which was how i found out about petflow ), and it stated that i could get 00_%_off + free_shipping with a certain coupon on code .
neutral	right after i made my purchase i realized that i did get the discount but not the free_shipping .
neutral	when i was about to contact customer_service , i saw that free_shipping only applies to orders that are over $_00 after the discount .
neutral	this was irritating to find out , especially_since it was not written anywhere on the coupon .
neutral	i like the labels i got but i didn_'_t realize how small they would be when printed .
neutral	i wish there were an option to print a sample of some_sort .
neutral	i would have ordered larger ones ( and paid more ) if i had realized how small my labels were going to be .
neutral	the shipping and delivery were very fast - i think i had them in about a week .
neutral	process was very slow , uncomfortable needing to give credit_card number twice for reservation after reservation was already confirmed .
neutral	also , did not realize i was not speaking directly with the hotel chain until i got this email !
neutral	called for apt and scheduled april 0 at 0 am .
neutral	was called by mavis to review the apt details for a second time .
neutral	confirmed april 0 at 0 am .
neutral	arrived to find short - staffed department and scheduling in chaos as result .
neutral	offered to return the next_day at 0 am to be helpful though i was already in queue and set .
neutral	ed said i would be given priority the next_day as a result .
neutral	arrived at 0 am the next_day .
neutral	others who came after were serviced and out the door well before me .
neutral	replacing snows and aligning tires took 0 hours .
neutral	if this is priority service there is no reason to return .
neutral	i am giving a midpoint star_rating and i have otherwise been happy with the service .
neutral	i received the 00 pack case of wellness_cat_food in good time , although half of the cans had dents in them .
neutral	i am not satisfied to see thsis although none of the cans yet have leaked there is always that potential .
neutral	still_waiting for order
neutral	hotline reagiert nicht bzw .
neutral	erst , wenn sich die sache bereits erledigt hat , auf mails für umbuchungen .
neutral	solange alles nach plan läuft , ist der service sonst in ordnung ...
neutral	odered the item on wednesday .
neutral	thursday - an in stock order was had a status of order pending for over 00_hours and when i rang to question why i was told it was because i had used my points and the order had got stuck so it would be forwarded .
neutral	friday - the order was recieved the next_day .
neutral	opened it up and i have a game missing .
neutral	another phone_call was made and this time i was told they would contact the warehouse and only after a small stock take of the item was completed then they would forward the item 0st_class recorded .
neutral	saturday - the item that was missing arrives .
neutral	finally a complete order .
neutral	0 days to complete an order that should have taken 00_hours .
neutral	not very impressive .
neutral	this service is maybe too safe , i can '_t seem to get my registration completed because i have moved and my new address is not showing at the 0 major credit_bureaus yet .
neutral	i have sent in everything asked of me and i do appreciate the protection , however this getting to be too much of a hassle .
neutral	identity_guard provides nice credit information , but there is very little to show about your membership .
neutral	i upgraded it at one point , understanding that my reports would come once a month , then the system returned me to my former quarterly report membership , where i could not see a report more than every 0 months .
neutral	there is no online reference to my membership , and when i called to speak to someone about it , they knew less_than i did .
neutral	also , when i called to ask about updating a public record , they did not know how to proceed to do that .
neutral	we placed an order , and had acceptable levels of communication until i gave the ok . at that point we received no confirmation that the order had been officially placed or an estimate for when the drives would be arriving .
neutral	after a phone_call and an_email with no response , a coworker followed_up again and we received confirmation almost a week after the initial attempts .
neutral	the drives made it fine and were as expected but additional communication would have made the interaction much less_stressful .
neutral	there are some good deals , however when something does quite work out and you want a refund you have to wait a few_weeks before you receive anything .
neutral	also when trying to contact it takes a long time to get a reply ... as in a couple of weeks .
neutral	using reservation_counter was easy ; i did not realize i was not using the motel 0 site .
neutral	to my surprise , my credit_card was billed for the full_amount the next_day -- a full six_weeks before my stay .
neutral	i feel this practice is dishonest .
neutral	motel 0 never did this , so i didn_'_t expect it since it wasn_'_t obvious to me that i wasn_'_t on the motel 0 site .
neutral	it doesn_'_t matter in the long run , the rooms are paid for and i will use them , i '_ll just be more careful about which site i use to reserve my rooms in the future .
neutral	very helpful sometimes .
neutral	but , could be more easy to apply .
neutral	and more mailroom and file clerk positions all in brooklyn area * only *
neutral	we placed our order , was pleased how quickly it all began and pleasant service , with 0st 0 pair .. then come to find out with other 0 pair , 0 was on back order for some time , the other , after many calls .. come to be told they were just not going to carry product any longer !!
neutral	then i had to redecide a new pair , and await them to be ordered , and recieved , kept being told should be there soon , took a lot longer !
neutral	!
neutral	overall pleased with all products in the end finally !
neutral	!
neutral	i have been happy with the overall service but would say the 0 - 00 day payment processing u state on the website is grossly misleading .
neutral	on each_occasion it has_been a month from delivery to receipt of money .
neutral	hard to write a review when we still have not received the part .
neutral	first off i tried_calling 0 times to talk to someone , was on hold each time for 00_minutes before hanging up .
neutral	finally i ordered it online .
neutral	i thought i was getting the part from new_jersey but it left from texas .
neutral	all the reviews i read on the site said people received their part in 0 - 0 days so i was hopeful .
neutral	we are down a car and live far from work and it has_been extremely difficult getting around , so getting this part quick was important .
neutral	the initial tracking said we would get the part on november 00 , ok not bad one week from ordering .
neutral	but no , outside of partsgeek control ups misrouted the package and i was told that we would have to just sit back and wait for the part to show up .
neutral	this part is cursed .
neutral	so now we have less time on the warranty from partgeek .
neutral	maybe next time i will buy local and pay more for the part but have the car on the road .
neutral	bad_experience overall .
neutral	i did not receive a notice my gift_card had shipped , so i had to track the order .
neutral	i do not understand_why shipping time takes so long .
neutral	was given arrival_date 00 days away after shipped .
neutral	delivery of the vehicule was fine but whe it came to pick_up it was impossible to get through on either the mobile number or the booking phone line .
neutral	as a results we were hanging_around in the heathrow car_park for about 00_mins with two small_children late in the evenng , so stress_free it wasn ; t .
neutral	i don_'_t like giving negative_reviews but i was disappointed with the spray i ordered for a funeral .
neutral	for nearly_£_00 i had hoped for flowers which looked fresh rather_than wilted .
neutral	the enormous white ribbon looked totally out of place both in colour and style given the occasion .
neutral	i also don_'_t want an account but can '_t post this review without accepting iflorist '_s terms and conditions
neutral	nu am apreciat faptul ca pe unul dintre produsele comandate parte din ingrediente erau acoperite cu marker negru permanent pentru a nu fi vizibile .
neutral	my item ' the last of us : joel edition ' got to me quickly but the box was damaged which i was annoyed with , and then i check the contents and one of the pages in the art book was ripped like someone had open it before it was shipped which i was really upset with , so my item is in pretty bad condition
neutral	after receiving email from yourself telling_me my phone had past and was in working order , and that payment would follow shortly , i had to call a couple of times to ask where the cheque was .
neutral	you had had my appliance for over a week and still on sign , and at the moment i am still_waiting .
neutral	tonight i used bookit for the first time .
neutral	i was trying to book a hotel room for my husband and myself for a weekend_getaway to celebrate our anniversary .
neutral	tried several other_sites as well ( orbitz , expedia , priceline , hotwire ), but went with bookit because it seemed to have the best price with the most information .
neutral	i filled out the info requested , clicked the bookit !
neutral	button .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	and got an_error_message .
neutral	it said the credit_card number i ' d submitted was not correct .
neutral	that was true : i had omitted a digit .
neutral	i corrected it , tried again -- same message .
neutral	again -- same message .
neutral	found a customer_service number , called it , spoke to a charming and helpful young_man ( can '_t recall his name ), who was able to complete the transaction for me over the phone , but it was a long and tiresome process .
neutral	he seemed to need to verify each piece of information three_times .
neutral	i hope he is representative of the staff because his pleasant humor helped_me to maintain mine .
neutral	but i hope the website can be improved to recognize corrections .
neutral	the dress i bought didn_'_t fit me and i was disappointed that there was not an opportunity to exchange the dress for a larger_size .
neutral	i '_ve returned the dress but haven_'_t had my money back yet and i fear that could take some time .
neutral	i haven_'_t even had an_email to let_me know they '_ve received the dress back .
neutral	would be nice to have more communication between the customer and boohoo .
neutral	thanks the first quote i got was £_00 . 00 - it went up to £_00 in five_minutes .
neutral	could you explain please ?,
neutral	i love the idea behind it and the range of flavours is fantastic however i ordered medium strength apple and strawberry eliquid with the e pen and i have found that this is too strong .
neutral	i '_ve had a very sore chest using it !
neutral	i have therefor ordered one low mg of nicotine and some without_any to see the difference .
neutral	in my opinion the medium burns but i '_ve been told that they all so but i like to give things the benefit of the doubt and the taste of the eliquid are lovely and the range is huge :) i think it '_s likely that medium was just too strong for me .
neutral	the battery life on the epen is fab and looks great .
neutral	i ' d deffo give it a try
neutral	the bag is too big for the filling supplied .
neutral	not enough beans so when you sit_down you end up on the floor .
neutral	i used charlene '_s safe ride to get to and from the airport on a recent visit .
neutral	the ride to the airport was fine : the driver was on time , courteous , and knew where he was going .
neutral	yhe ride that picked me up was less so .
neutral	first , as i '_m landing i get a phone_call from the driver , who says that he cannot wait for me any longer and will send another driver soon .
neutral	the thing is , i had not only given charlene '_s safe ride my flight number so they could track the flight , but my flight had arrived 00_minutes early .
neutral	another driver calls me eventually and i after i get my luggage i meet the driver at a designated pick_up spot .
neutral	the driver does not get out of the car to help me with my bags , or even open the trunk of the car .
neutral	despite having a gps in his car and the fact that i told him i had never been to durham before , he asked me for directions to where i was staying .
neutral	i was not impressed by his service or his abilities as a driver .
neutral	but i '_ve definitely had worse taxi experiences in my life .
neutral	i actually had worse taxi experiences while visiting durham .
neutral	this is why give the service 0_stars .
neutral	i had heard good things about bookit from friends who use this agency .
neutral	so when planning for spring_break , i felt secure in choosing bookit .
neutral	this was my first time and it was quite simple .
neutral	i need to test_drive it a few more times to see if there are real savings in using this agency .
neutral	right now , i have booked a great hotel in orlando but didn_'_t see any difference in price from booking on the actual hotel website .
neutral	bookit actually cost a little more in price but offered a $_00 off coupon which brought me to the same price as what the hotel offered .
neutral	also , there is a cost to cancel no_matter when you cancel .
neutral	most hotels give you until the day of to cancel at no charge .
neutral	bookit charges a $_00 " service fee " regardless of when you cancel .
neutral	but the trip is planned and the hotel is booked , i just hope there are no_issues at check in .
neutral	hoping this is was worth it .
neutral	its easy to order online ' they inform you when its ben shipped . one thing i dont understand_why it took a week to ship ?
neutral	i had an_appointment for 0am , to simply get snow_tires put on .
neutral	i did not leave until 00 : 00 am .
neutral	why make an_appointment ?
neutral	also a technician told me that all the car fluids look like they have never been changed .
neutral	this was not true .
neutral	why was the technician checking the car fluids , when all i wanted was the car tires changed ?
neutral	received a few_weeks_ago but just installed .
neutral	as always after i installed got the low ink message but then printed b_& w ok . have only used hp_cartridges in the past but performance was awful so thought id try your product out .
neutral	only_negative the black_ink dripped all over my hands on the large black_cartridge ... didn_'_t make me happy 😚
neutral	i bought three swimsuits which are all very sexy and i love the styles .
neutral	i ordered them in a medium according to the size_chart on the website ( i '_m 0 ' 0 and 000 #, 00 - 00 - 00 and normally_wear a size 0 - 0 ), however one of them is almost too big and the other two are too small .
neutral	there are no returns or exchanges , so now i '_ve wasted money on two suits that i cannot wear .
neutral	i '_m very disappointed as i wanted to wear them on our trip to mexico , but now they will just sit in a drawer .
neutral	overall my experience was okay but i did have problems with ordering on - line .
neutral	everything was fine until we got to processing the order and it told me that it could not complete my order as there was an_error , so i assumed that it had not taken my order and then_proceeded to order from somewhere_else .
neutral	then i check my e_- mails and find that my order has_been dispatched !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	what rating_system do you use : fico or vantage ?
neutral	the storage_unit on west street ( with the lighthouse ) has an extreme shortage of carts for moving items in and out of storage_units .
neutral	i believe there are no more than 0 or 0 for the entire facility and most appear to be decades old .
neutral	i spoke with a customer_service representative about this issue and she noted that the owners were aware of the problem but were unwilling to spend funds in purchasing additional carts .
neutral	ottentimes , i have had to search through all of the buildings for a cart only to find none are available .
neutral	in general , the facility is poorly maintained ( elevators , hallways , lighting , carts , etc_.)
neutral	the hair test all though gave a result of either possive or negative should be given more clearly , if possitive .. how offten drugs have been used .
neutral	and the " cut_off " amount detectable !?
neutral	what does this even mean ?
neutral	it was not explained in the instruction .
neutral	so does this mean that a very small_amount can be detcted but the result still be negative ?
neutral	a little more info needed for customers .
neutral	this site is a helpful tool to finding employment , however one must me computer saavy in order to access the site .
neutral	we lost a whole day of vacation to our destination when there were no weather issues whatsoever and we missed our connection .
neutral	spent 0 hours in laguardia airport waiting .
neutral	then , at our return , we were forced to incur additonal hotel , car and airline seat expenses when delta cancelled our flight home without recourse .
neutral	travelocity should not use delta_airlines if it wants to insure customer loyalty .
neutral	my shower seat hasn_'_t bee installed or used yet , but looks good .
neutral	i believe it should be mentioned that hudson - reed requires packages to be physically handed to purchaser , a serious inconvenience for me .
neutral	i ordered 0 custom water_bottles .
neutral	the template and customization was very easy to use , and i got exactly_what i ordered .
neutral	the one thing i didn_'_t particularly like was that the two images i placed on the water_bottles were not spaced to be on opposite sides .
neutral	rather , they ended_up right next to each other , which looked a little odd .
neutral	i must_admit , though , that is the way they appeared on the proof .
neutral	i guess i just thought they would be printed more evenly spaced out .
neutral	good basic price spoilled by ridiculous card charges . also hard to contact by phone ( at 00p_per_minute ) and slow response to e_mail following automated holding reply .
neutral	the service has worked well but the call to confirm we had signed_up for service was tooooo long .
neutral	we were in canada and i had to borrow a phone in a small community .
neutral	after confirming a lot of information i was left on the line while he went to check on something and a recording gave a variety of messages and said the operators were very busy .
neutral	after waiting for some time i hung_up .
neutral	we ordered a fender and under fender from your company .
neutral	they arrived in a timely_fashion and in great shape and the cost was very agreeable .
neutral	the shipping_costs were astronomical in comparison to the price of the part .
neutral	i understand that they were oversized but , wow .
neutral	the cost .
neutral	almost 0x as much as the cost of the part .
neutral	would probably use you again but hopefully the costs of shipping go down .
neutral	it is still cheaper_than taking the car to a body shop by_far .
neutral	the delivery did not show up at all on the first day it was planned for and nobody rang to let_me know .
neutral	when i contacted tnt at 0 . 00pm at night the man i spoke to said he would put it on an am delivery for the following_tuesday .
neutral	when i rang to check this on the tuesday it was on the lorry but not for an am delivery but it did get here just after 00 which was fine .
neutral	i have yet to install the 0 radiators but am hoping they are ok .
neutral	the packaging they were in was very badly_damaged and split_open completely at the top etc .
neutral	i got the driver to write this on his slip but hopefully they will be ok !
neutral	!
neutral	i was quite impressed at the speed this item arrived from when i ordered it .
neutral	the item was a peacoat for my son as a xmas_present .
neutral	i kept the jacket in it '_s polythene packaging before wrapping because this made it easier to wrap .
neutral	however , i wish i hadn_'_t because when my son opened his present on xmas day , it was to find the jacket had a button missing and 0 other buttons were hanging by threads !
neutral	it was a great disappointment and i cannot understand how this item passed quality control .
neutral	i will not be ordering online from this company again .
neutral	i first ordered flowers from you years_ago and it was always an exciting experience .
neutral	one could sense that you were a young and enthusiastie company .
neutral	now you seem an old and tired company - tired graphics , the usual photos , no more zippy intros .
neutral	this time i ordered over the mid - august holiday so perhaps you were very busy .
neutral	but there will always be a mid - august holiday and you will always know what to expect .
neutral	you took a while to sort out and acknowledge my order and i worried till the last about delivey date .
neutral	in fact i think my flowers arrived a day late .
neutral	i received a thank - you photo from the receiving end in bruxelles and the flowers looked as though they too had suffered in the mix - up . you '_ll have to try a lot harder flora macqueen .
neutral	i love my new bedroom_furniture now its finally arrived .
neutral	the problem was they lost the wardrobe , found it , lost it , found it , lost it , found it ...... you get the idea .
neutral	each time the warehouse contacted me to arrange delivery i arranged time off work , then each time i was contacted again to say they had lost it again .
neutral	some problem with it showing on the computer but they could actually find it .
neutral	staff were very apologetic and polite but not a good experience
neutral	i paid for some day deliver , but then received email that flowers could not be delivered saturday due to lack of man power .
neutral	flowers to be delivered today monday .
neutral	i have not reveived any confirmation of delivery yet !
neutral	i liked the email to let_me know there was problem but still do not know if delivery was successful .
neutral	more discounts on airfares gor frequent flyers
neutral	i had the most frustrating time again with dpd delivery service .
neutral	they sent me an_email_saying that a delivery was due between 0 : 00_pm and 0 : 00_pm that day i was very busy working from home but had to be out for half an_hour to drop_off my son and other children to their class between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 .
neutral	now i was not sure what the delivery was of as i had ordered several things from different places over the previous days .
neutral	some of these things were urgent .
neutral	i desperately tried to find a tel number i could speak to them asking them to avoid delivering during the only half_hour of the day i was not going to be in .
neutral	it was impossible to find a tel number and talk to a person !!!!
neutral	this in itself was hugely frustrating .
neutral	i tried their other options on offer 0 ) change time via their computer system .
neutral	i took note of the numbers they sent me via_email but the system was also asking me for another number which i did not have - presumably the system has_been designed to change time after a failed delivery - but was was i to do if i wanted to change it ( slightly ) on the day ?
neutral	i also tried_phoning the automating system and found that very frustrating as it mentioned that if one wanted the item re - delivered on set days / time there was a charge but did not say what the charge was , it instead asked to select a certain button if i wanted to proceed with this option , but i could not select this option if i did not know what the charge would be .
neutral	i sent them an_email venting my frustration and telling them of my needs but they did not return my call .
neutral	dear myprotein you offer excellent service and your products are reasonably_priced but please change your delivery service as this puts me off buying from you now .
neutral	many_thanks .
neutral	i have purchased a few items from superdry alongside the hat .
neutral	after a the first or second wear the knitted hat began to stretch and eventually lost its shape .
neutral	have found this with other items including the messengers bags which the leather began to chip almost straight_away .
neutral	nice looking items , but poor quality
neutral	lego technic rescue helicopter arrived_promptly .
neutral	however , i was not very impressed with the packaging .
neutral	it arrived in a large box which was extensively damaged and open at one end - luckily the box inside had not fallen out !
neutral	i ordered 0 airplanes from canada to be sent to my son in a different province .
neutral	the order was placed on jan . 00 , 0000 and it arrived on jan . 00 , 0000 - over 0_weeks for delivery is unacceptable .
neutral	more_importantly , the planes arrived at my home and now i have to pay shipping to send them to him .
neutral	very disappointing !
neutral	received several items with labels cut out or marked out
neutral	i felt this took a very long time to arrive .
neutral	the idea was nice though .
neutral	it was easy to submit and ship the items , but since i asked for the amount to be sent to a charity , i have not received any proof of the amount nor of the donation in my name !
neutral	the sizing was off but the overall pricing was nice .
neutral	i would love to give you a review , but even_though the ups website says my package has_been delivered , it is not here !
neutral	they have obviously delivered it to the wrong_address , and my appointment with the mechanic is tomorrow .
neutral	not good .
neutral	will have to get up and start looking around at neighbors houses !
neutral	no cabia la maleta en_el maletero , era mínimo sin maletero .
neutral	en la foto viene un coche con maletero y dice que cabe una maleta y no es verdad .
neutral	nos dijeron que antes sí que daban coches con maletero pero que ha cambiado el modelo del economy y ahora es así .
neutral	good variety of clothing but slow customer_service .
neutral	took very long to arrive , but at_least all my items were there this time
neutral	this site will only post review if they are positive , any complaints at all and they will not post it .
neutral	items usually arrive in a timely_manner and mostly i have been happy with them , but not being honest about the reviews have deterred me from using them again .
neutral	i get a certain cat_litter at our local farm store and was getting 00 #_bag for a fairly good price , then they went to a 00 #_bag and charged me the same price .
neutral	so i went online to of course find a better deal .
neutral	found pet care and they were offering the 00 #_bag of cat_litter for the price i was giving at the store , so i order and got the auto_ship then i get a call and they say that they are now switching to the 00 #_bag and you guessed it , it '_s the same price as the 00 #_bag .
neutral	why would i want to spend the same for less ?
neutral	so i cancelled the auto_ship and will no_longer be getting my litter from pet care .
neutral	i guess i '_ll give our local farm store my money at_least i don_'_t have to pay them sh + h just tax which is cheaper .
neutral	:_d
neutral	let_me start by saying that i love priceline .
neutral	i have been an_avid user for years !
neutral	however , i do have one beef that i '_m not sure they would be able to deal with but should really consider something :
neutral	parking fees when bidding !!
neutral	!
neutral	there has got to be a way of identifying a parking fee range when bidding on hotels .
neutral	i think it is absolutely_ridiculous to get a good rate ( at_least you think it '_s great ) and then get slapped with a $_00 - 00 parking fee or be forced to use valet_parking because there are no other options available .
neutral	example_: got a deal for $_00 and taxes / fees pushed it to $_00 .
neutral	valet_parking pushed my total rate up by $_00 to $_000 .
neutral	really though ?
neutral	so much for a good bidding deal .
neutral	i would have chosen the other deal for $_00 that included parking even_though the hotel was probably a little further away from where we needed to be .
neutral	priceline , you really need to consider at_least putting in a parking fee range , like $_00 - 00 or $_00 - 00 .
neutral	most of the hotels in certain areas charge within the same range so it would still be a little difficult to figure_out which hotel you ' re going to get .
neutral	other than that , i will still use priceline !
neutral	erica
neutral	prices were good but was offset by the shipping_costs .
neutral	i also needed something right_away and it took too long for it to ship .
neutral	would be good to have the further information_regarding the delivery ( eg .
neutral	package number , scheduled delivery date ).
neutral	kr
neutral	despite_being given two delivery addresses a card was left through the recipients door to say they would call again around 0pm .
neutral	when they still hadnt arrived at gone 0pm the recipient called the florist who asked if they could deliver them the folowing , they were told no because they were a birthday_present & also she was going to be out the following_day .
neutral	the flowers were eventually delivered at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	i really like the visa_gift_card idea , so that my friends could buy themselves anything they ' d enjoy .
neutral	the picture and message option really personalized it for them .
neutral	however the web_site said i would receive an_email once their card shipped .
neutral	when i didn_'_t hear_anything in 0 days , and the web_site still said " now processing ," i called and was told it had shipped 0 days earlier .
neutral	my friends later said they had received it , but the web_site still at this time says "... now processing .
neutral	we will email you when it ships ."
neutral	the web_site should really send us more detailed info as_promised , especially with such large value cards .
neutral	when i pointed this out to the service person on the phone , she sounded truly bored by my concern .
neutral	with name your own price , i got a 0_star_hotel for $_00 instead of $_000_per_night .
neutral	fabulous until i decided to extend the stay .
neutral	couldn_'_t get the same hotel again but also couldn_'_t change the region on their website .
neutral	called for assistance and couldn_'_t get a person on the phone -- totally infuriating !
neutral	nice part no screws
neutral	at first everything was fine .
neutral	i placed the reservations online for our trip to hawaii and all the excursions that go with it .
neutral	then i went to confirms the excursions as requested and the tour company in hawaii didn_'_t have the reservation .
neutral	i called bookit . com and the lady_who helped_me was fabulous !
neutral	she found my reservation , called the tour company in hawaii and all was fixed for the first company .
neutral	at this point i would have given them 0 starts .
neutral	then i called the second tour company to confirm reservations and again , they didn_'_t have it .
neutral	so i called bookit . com once again .
neutral	this time , a woman talked to me and put me on hold for 0 / 0 hr and never came back to me .
neutral	so i hung_up and called again .
neutral	this time a gentleman answered and put me on hold for about 00_min and came back and said he was working on it and put me back on hold for 00min .
neutral	i hung_up and called back again ... very agitated by this time ... again was put on hold for 0 / 0 hr they came back on and i asked for a supervisor to no_avail .
neutral	the lady told me i was being rude and that our reservations for activities weren_'_t covered by bill me later !
neutral	how did the other tour get taken_care of !
neutral	at this point my husband took over !
neutral	he called and talked to another gentleman_who was extremely_helpful , told us it would be taken_care of within_00hrs and it was !
neutral	we were able to contact the tour company in hawaii and confirm all reservations .
neutral	so if it weren_'_t for the three inept customer_service reps , i would have given them 0_stars .
neutral	unfortunately , we didn_'_t get names of the two amazing reps !
neutral	ordered a jacket online to be delivered next_day delivery .
neutral	was advised it had been despatched in an_email and through using their online_chat system and after wating in on the designated day with no sign of delivery , i rang and spoke to a customer rep .
neutral	he told me that due to an_issue with the courier my jacket had not been despatched after all .
neutral	he was at pains to stress that the company was unusual in offering next_day delivery without an_additional_charge but as i said to him it '_s of no use to me if the jacket still sits in their warehouse and why send emails saying it had been despatched when it hadnt !
neutral	misleading !
neutral	the jacket was them promised for 0 days time - thursday .
neutral	again , i had a phone_call from the customer_services rep and an_email_saying the jacket would be delivered on thursday before 00 am .
neutral	imagine my surprise on wednesday ( a day earlier ) when i was just about to go out and could have missed them completely , the courier turned_up with the jacket .
neutral	would i order from this company again is the crucial thing here - i think only if i had exhausted all other possible options for the supply of an item and was desperate .
neutral	the bonadventure hotel was attractive but the service at the desk was poor and unfriendly .
neutral	the service at the restaurant was marginal and the menu limited .
neutral	i would not stay there again
neutral	i received my wayfarer sunglasses and they are much lighter than my other pair , and the box they came in wasn_'_t sealed and the microfibre cloth wasn_'_t in a plastic package like my previous pair .
neutral	the lenses are polarized , but it just seemed a little sketchy .
neutral	i did appreciate the fact that it was sent as a " gift " so i was not charged duty on it though !
neutral	call me if you want full details .
neutral	000 * 000 * 0000
neutral	tricia taylor
neutral	overall , i cannot_complain as the rate was fair and the car was ok .
neutral	i did decide to pay the extra insurance just in case anything unexpected happend .
neutral	when i returned the car , the antenna was missing , i suspect that someone unscrewed it in a parking_lot somewhere , although i had not noticed it when i picked_up the car .
neutral	i think that when something like that happens , especially as minor as it was and the extra insurance was paid a person should not be questioned about it .
neutral	just give me the receipt and let_me be off .
neutral	it '_s ok if you want to stay one or two_nights .
neutral	not sure if it '_s okay since i bought the book from your website , but i '_m concerned that the book says on the front cover and on the back : " not for sale in the united_states " international student_edition .
neutral	switched from dish network to directv a year_ago so my husband could get his beloved broncos games ( we lived in mo ).
neutral	my bill went | up nearly $_00 for the same package ( no i '_m not including the super fan package we paid_extra for ).
neutral	it was very expensive to start - even_though you ' re not " buying " the equipment , we still had to pay nearly $_000 to lease the boxes for our 0 tv '_s .
neutral	installation was horrible , the guy was a real moron , drilled holes all over the place and cut the cable so we can '_t ever use the outlets in our walls again ( we also had cable internet and they had to re - run all the cables because of the directv installation ).
neutral	supposedly the picture is better with directv , but i never noticed .
neutral	i hate that i have to have 0 seperate dvr '_s ( dish let you have one that ran 0 tv '_s - also saved on the monthly bill ).
neutral	we have since relocated and put the bill on hold for 0 months ( very nice feature ).
neutral	this time the installer was great .
neutral	very professional , did a great job , and our tv '_s work off of the cable outlets already in our walls ... no new holes !
neutral	i still feel_like the bill is pricy compared to dish network , and will_definitely be shopping around once our contract is up .
neutral	i would say compare the two , they each have specific things they offer ( ie broncos games for us ) and watch the installers like a hawk !
neutral	easy to book on this website .
neutral	very nice product but very disappointing engraving , it is barely visable .
neutral	the employee taking my reservation was very pleasant , but i had difficulty understanding him .
neutral	whatever his language / dialect , he often had to repeat so that i could understand .
neutral	i , too , had to repeat my letters as he was taking information .
neutral	the product is fine and does the job , but the web_site went crazy and made two orders for me .
neutral	i thought i had canceled one of them , but today , my second " order " arrived .
neutral	i think i will make a phone order the next time !
neutral	i think bestpet do some lovely products but when you pay for first_class post it takes 0 days !
neutral	to be fair bestpet did refund the difference - 00p - but it didn_'_t make up for it .
neutral	even_though the clothes are not maternity wear they work well for that purpose the on problem i had was that the postage took to long i ordered on the 00 th and didn_'_t recieve until the 0 rd way more then the 0 day quoted
neutral	i used petflow abot 0_weeks_ago and thought they were great .
neutral	then i received reminders that the products i had ordered before were getting ready to ship again .
neutral	i needed to change one of the items and didn_'_t want 0 separate_orders when i could put them all into one order .
neutral	that '_s when i began to run_into trouble .
neutral	it '_s difficult to substitute and impossible to combine 0 orders into one as i found out .
neutral	i thought i ' d succeeded because i ' d received a message that my order was ready to ship .
neutral	i waited and waited and it never came .
neutral	i finally called and was told there was no such order .
neutral	thankfully the individual i spoke with was on it immediately and shipped my new order right_away .
neutral	the spoiled_rotten_box was a rip_off .
neutral	for $_00 it said with enough merchandise for the retail price of $_00 .
neutral	i got a chew toy and some eye_drops and 0 dog training treats .
neutral	not $_00 worth .
neutral	we asked if we could have two rooms that were connected with a pass through door because we were traveling with our teenage_girls .
neutral	they said it was no problem and it was available , but when we checked in it was not the rooms we got , there was a room in between us .
neutral	besides that the hotel was great and the kids had a great time .
neutral	the rooms are very clean and comfortable we would definitely stay there again .
neutral	i was excited to purchase coconut_oil form this site , not so excited when i received the box soiled in coconut_oil that had somehow leaked from the container !
neutral	packaging is important !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i am not really happy as not received my goods yet over a week_ago had to call twice . and still not here ...
neutral	i bought the " video_game princess wig " and it was terrible .
neutral	zero_stars .
neutral	a lot of hair came off of it as soon as i took it out of the package , and there weren_'_t much hair on it in the first pace .
neutral	if you go look at the picture they provide , the hair that is on the model '_s left shoulder is all the hair that this wig includes .
neutral	it was a terrible mullet looking thing .
neutral	just don_'_t buy it .
neutral	the " sexy pink princess costume " was awesome .
neutral	five_stars .
neutral	surprised by the quality actually .
neutral	didn_'_t look super wrinkly out of the package like a lot of the costumes usually do .
neutral	the costumes came about 0 days ahead of estimated time which was great because it gave_me time to replace the terrible wig .
neutral	i took two golden bus_tours in two_days .
neutral	the first was to warwick castle , which was amazing but we were only given two hours .
neutral	afterwards we went to stratford - upon - avon , which was only another hour , and oxford , which had the same time limit .
neutral	two places would have been better with a two to three hour stop at each , since all are places you can easily spend a day in .
neutral	the next_morning we went to warner brothers studio , and as an_avid harry_potter fan i felt that the three hours i had by the time i got in went far too fast .
neutral	golden_tours is great at getting you outside london to see different things , but only barely , as there is seriously no time to fully appreciate the places you ' re going .
neutral	i have made several orders to inkfarm .
neutral	i have always had very good service and the ink_cartridges have worked fine .
neutral	i did have a c000b cartridge for a canon_printer that ink actually ran_out onto my hands and clothes when i took the cover / tape off of the cartridge .
neutral	it was evidently overfull , as i was holding it upright and it still overflowed and ran_out on me .
neutral	overall , though , i would recommend inkfarm .
neutral	price and service is good .
neutral	happy with service and delivery , as it said it would be .
neutral	slightly disappointed in the chair , found the positioning of the adjustable seat , chest plate and arm rest not great - even at its highest position the arm rest barely supported my hands and the angle of the chair is quite up right .
neutral	also the space between the seat and the leg supports is not very big , so fi someone was heavy it would be uncomfortable .
neutral	that said , the material is good quality , plenty of padding , good carry case and sturdy frame .
neutral	i would have liked a break_down of what each item i sent was valued at and also had items that they couldn_'_t use returned as i had requested .
neutral	the online ordering was so difficult i had to start again at_least 0 times , i gave up on the first try and had to start again on another day .
neutral	the message entry does not show until after you pay , so i really was not sure my gift would have any message at all .
neutral	on the upside , when i finally got thru the wonky ordering process the cards were delivered on time and everyone was happy .
neutral	very regular customer of tennis_nuts and until my last experience had no_problems .
neutral	i placed an order for tennis_shoes among other items however the shoes were needed for a tournament over the weekend so i paid_extra for next_day delivery .
neutral	the shoes did not arrive even_though they were confirmed on the dispatch note !
neutral	a mistake at shipping left the shoes out of the order .
neutral	i had to go out and buy an extra pair of trainers in order for my son to pay .
neutral	i was refunded for the shoes but not next_day delivery which left me feeling disappointed in the service as i have been a regular customer
neutral	i use ebay all the time ( who doesn_'_t ) but until recently i never needed any customer_service and it was dreadful .
neutral	all over it is a good site but really need to look at their customer_service .
neutral	my son has size 0 . 0 feet .
neutral	i ordered addidas trainers in a 0 . 0 but they turned_out to be too small .
neutral	i returned then and ordered 00 , they were also too small !
neutral	so were 00 . 0 , i am now waiting for the 00 to arrive !
neutral	service has even excellent , but am frustrated by the very dubious sizing !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i have not received my package as of march 0 , 0000
neutral	we signed_up on line and i thought i was signing_up for $ 0 . 00 a day plus $ 0 . 00 which would have come to a total of $_00 . 00 .
neutral	they actually charged me $_00 . 00 .
neutral	this included $ 0 fuel surcharge $ 0 pa access fee , and 00_% parking tax added on top of a $ 0 . 00 / day basic fee .
neutral	they said they charged me $ 0 . 00 / day because i supposedly signed_up for valet parring .
neutral	i didn_'_t actually use valet , and i don_'_t think k i really signed_up for it ..
neutral	i used self_park but they refused to give me that rate .
neutral	so i felt_like they took_advantage of me .. to be fair the drop_off and pick_up were .
neutral	fine .
neutral	but i still don_'_t know why they advertised $ 0 . 00 / day then charged me $ 0 . 00 / day .
neutral	not opened the goods yet but delivery was on time & efficient .
neutral	only_complaint was that i was left with 0 giant wooden pallets to dispose of at my expense as the driver said he was not allowed to take them back .
neutral	i even unloaded my goods from the pallet myself - didn_'_t really need a pallet for what i ordered anyway .
neutral	need the pallets uplifted please !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a medium but it came and was more like an 0 - 00 not 00 - 00
neutral	online you can only send it back and get a refund so if i wanted next size up will have to do another order and payment which is annoying waitin for refund to then do it all again
neutral	i ordered 00x00x0 and got 00x00 .
neutral	customer_service sent fedex to pick them up and then i received the correct size but it took another phone_call and 0 more weeks .
neutral	the price is fantastic compared to ordering through lowes .
neutral	as always longacres flower_arrangement was beautiful and fresh and arrived as scheduled .
neutral	nearly a week_later the flowers are doing well with only a couple of the roses have tuned over now .
neutral	the problem was thart my mother had no_idea who had sent the flowers or why , as the card i had written had not been attached .
neutral	it was only on phoning longacres my mother was able to get the card message .
neutral	i needed a part fast and wanted buy part online in state or close enough to get 0 to 0 day shipping .
neutral	company is in nj .
neutral	nowhere on site did it say it ships parts from different warehouse .
neutral	did not say at checkout either .
neutral	only to find out after 0 day later i got tracking_info , it was shipped from ca , and had to wait another 0 days .
neutral	i had excellent service , except when it came to delivery .
neutral	it was not left at my address although i was at home .
neutral	one of my neighbours found it outside his daughters flat which is no .
neutral	0 .
neutral	as this person works away a lot it was just by very good luck that her father called that day other wise i would have been very concerned with the non delivery of the washing hoist .
neutral	yours_sincerely
neutral	iris mcmenamin .
neutral	holyport .
neutral	have used travelocity several_times over the years and always easy site although a bit_slow at times .
neutral	questions could be submitted and one would get an answer within 00_hours .
neutral	not so this time , all have managed to get is a drop down list of questions and pre_- printed answer with a one question survey .... was answer helpful ?
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	good customer_service
neutral	the first half of our reservation is wonderful and the web_site was super .
neutral	still_waiting to receive the referenwice # or confirmation on the return trip via pentland ferry .
neutral	hope it comes soon as we depart on the 0th of june to begin our holiday .
neutral	i purchased a part from your website , as it said there was one available .
neutral	needed it by the weekend , as my son would be home and his car needed the part .
neutral	was told , after the purchase went through , that they did not in fact have this part and would have to cancel my purchase .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i understand how this happens , but do not understand how the site wouldn_'_t have been updated .
neutral	delivery was fine and efficient as usual .
neutral	the only problem for me was the driver made me feel quite uncomfortable .
neutral	as a woman on her own in the house ( husband at work , kids at school ) he seemed to be getting quite familiar .
neutral	" is that your kettle i '_ve just heard boil " " i see your fence is down , bet that annoyed your husband or partner ?
neutral	do you have one ?"
neutral	i at no point allowed this man over the threshold of our property .
neutral	once he had finished his tea , he left , thankfully without further comments .
neutral	it was then i realised that he was still sat in his lorry outside and i received a text_message " thanks sweetheart , you really hit the spot !!"
neutral	a tad inappropriate if you ask me .
neutral	hasten to add i did not reply to his text and he soon departed .
neutral	i showed my husband the text when he got home and it was all i could do to stop him reporting this man for harassment .
neutral	if you read this please do not send this man out again !
neutral	!
neutral	it was a beautiul bouquet , delivered on time .
neutral	i just expected a bigger one for the price of 00_euros .
neutral	i was excited when i placed my order and was already wanting it the next_day , knowing that it was personalized i knew it would take a few_weeks to get .
neutral	i waited almost a month and then got really impatient ... i emailed customer_service and they responded but due to shipping with no insurance their was know way to track item .
neutral	i finally recieved the necklace and despite wanting to like it , i love it !
neutral	it is beautiful .
neutral	totally_worth the weight .
neutral	i will be placing a large order in january for hostess gifts for a wedding and a few other events i have to attend .
neutral	now that i know the time_frame i will spread the word of the company .
neutral	i was happy with the product , however i feel communication needs improving .
neutral	my order generated 00 emails - completely unnecessary !
neutral	also , i was asked to contact customer_services as there was ' an_issue ' with my order , when i phoned there was no issue and it was put straight through ( with no real checks of my details ).
neutral	i had asked for the delivery to be left by the recycling bins inside of my property and your deli very left it inside a plastic wheelie bin - in the heat the bin acts like an oven and is extremely hot inside , the frozen food was already soft in places and had defrosted therefore it is not safe to eat .
neutral	it was also a heavy parcel and i was unable to lift it out of the bin by myself .
neutral	had ordered one dress and 0 costumes , i got the shipping confirmation fairly quickly for the dress i ordered , however , none of the costumes were shipped with it .
neutral	i assumed they would be shipped in a seperate package .
neutral	then i recieved an_email in my junk_mail_stating there was a refund to my credit_card , but no reason_why or what it was from .
neutral	on reviewing the amount charged for the costumes , i realized that the refund was for the exact amount of all the costumes .
neutral	there was no communication about why the custumes were not shipped and at the time of my order , they all showed in stock .
neutral	i am happy with the dress i ordered and im sure i would feel the same about the costumes , had i recieved them , but i am not happy about the lack of communication from the company .
neutral	easy to book with on - line great offer ......
neutral	pick_up loaction clean and friendly however car not ready .
neutral	we were offered to pay for an upgrade due to no avilability which i thought was strange as normally if you are upgraded due to the car you have reserved not being avilable it is free .
neutral	eventually a different car was offered for an upgarde which was free of charge .
neutral	only problem we then had was the excessive charge to block on our card € 000 , they agreed to only € 000 after some discussion for being unreasonabley high .
neutral	which to me show that there is no need to have such a high excess when you have paid for insurance .
neutral	my recomendation woudl be to always challenge the amount companies want to block on credit_cards .
neutral	staff at car colloectoin and drop very friendly and helpful which gave a good experience even with a few hitches .
neutral	they changed my snow_tires and they said i needed balancing and alignment so the free snow tire change ( for buying them there ) still cost $_000 .
neutral	guess nothing is really free .
neutral	took about 0 0 / 0 hours longer then i expected even with an_appointment .
neutral	they were very pleasant .
neutral	great cusyomer serivece and clean facilities .
neutral	but if i was not in a rush and waited_until the last_minute i would have went somewhere_else .
neutral	the fact that there is no elevator and u are a mile away from the stairs and bump into the other units almost all the way trying to get to yours .
neutral	oh_yea one dolly .
neutral	placed an order for a beautiful hello_kitty bag & a couple of bracelets .
neutral	they put the billing_address on the package forcing me to drive to the ups facility to pick_up my package .
neutral	when i got it , i opened it up immediately , the bracelets were missing .
neutral	the packing_slip stated 0 bracelets shipped called amiclubwear immediately .
neutral	waited 00minutes & 00 seconds & gave up .
neutral	sent an_email later that night .
neutral	got a response the next_day saying that the bracelets were shipped , but they would give me a store credit .
neutral	i sent a follow_up email_stating they either were out of stock or they '_ve got a thief working for them .
neutral	they responded with a notice that i wouldn_'_t be able to receive the bracelets , but that my credit_card would be credited .
neutral	i informed them that i really would rather have the bracelets , then the credit .
neutral	really_enjoyed looking around at stuff and finally found the perfect love - seat / couch combo with two end tables and a coffee_table but the sales_person was caught up too much in making a bigger sale that he slipped up on delivery .
neutral	he promised one day delivery which we were happy about and were expecting it around 0pm saturday , so we waited_until 0pm and then called the store and they told us it was on the truck and out for delivery and would be calling us soon so we waiting some more ... 0 :_00pm came and no call , checked in again with the store and said the same thing as before .
neutral	waited_until 00pm and nothing .
neutral	called them as soon as they opened on sunday at 00am and found out that the sales_person never told the delivery drivers about it and so it was never even on the truck .
neutral	it was frustrating wasting a whole saturday waiting for your furniture you were promised but never arriving .
neutral	finally after the manager sorted_out the issue on sunday we received our stuff around 0pm .
neutral	i would recommend american_freight because i am happy with the furniture and the delivery drivers were extremely nice and helpful , but if you are promised one day delivery make_sure you ask for a manager to confirm that it will be on its way .
neutral	more often then not it seems identity_guard has a lot of trouble with its website , hope it '_s fixed soon as i pay for this service every_month !
neutral	wpuld love to correct information .... that is in coirrecct ....
neutral	there is no need to speak to a person ....
neutral	i should e able to do this myself ... not depend_on another person , to fix my information .
neutral	besides have been trying to update my payment_method and you will not accept the change ....... sooooooooooooooo ... guess the service is free
neutral	ithe items were in excellent condition and expertly packed , it was a pity that the company could not contact me to inform me they were waiting for an order to reach their premises and were not therefore able to have my completed order ready to send out .
neutral	this information would be helpful and keep customers informed of order progress .
neutral	i had to ring the company to ask why i had not received my goods .
neutral	i started the shake over 0_weeks_ago and i will say that it curbed my hunger a little_bit --- i have not gained weight but i have not lost any either -- i see nothing different then by just following a sensible diet - i feel the money could have went towards food instead of the shakes --- it di not help me lose but like i said i have not gained more .
neutral	i purchased this card for my daughter who '_s away at school , after having a bad_experience with another gift_card outlet and she wasn_'_t able to use it online with a lot of retailers .
neutral	so she was very disappointed .
neutral	getting the card was no problem the problem was i paid for 0 day shipping and it still took a week to get there very disapointed
neutral	i think the selection is great , but i wish i could return items if they did not work out .
neutral	the no return_policy or restocking_fee prevents me from taking a chance on clothing i think i might like .
neutral	the prom_dress i ordered for my daughter was lovely , but the sizing_chart suggested a size 00 when in fact a size 0 was correct .
neutral	i had ordered a side_mirror , and the listed stated poodle lights and heat .
neutral	neither apply to the product i received .
neutral	good price but dissapointed that i did not get the product i believed i was purchasing .
neutral	very irritating to find out a week_later that the seats i selected weren_'_t saved .
neutral	now my husband and i have to sit separately with strangers on our romantic getaway .
neutral	kinda made the deal not worth it , would have gone to a site that works better .
neutral	still have not received my controller i ordered on 00 / 00
neutral	i am so happy with my shipments -- and how easy it is to get product .
neutral	the only big problem is that in order to return product ( my sheltie '_s food changed , so the big bag must go back ) there are so many hoops that i still_haven_'_t attempted to send it back .
neutral	i wish that it was as easy as other_websites make it everyday ....
neutral	prices and selection are fantastic .
neutral	free_shipping is great , but i hate having to jump_through the hoops of the scheduled programs to get it .
neutral	perhaps a lot of people like and need the convenience of auto shipping , but it doesn_'_t put me out at all to log in and order items when i need them .
neutral	excellent parts selection with good prices , but i was disappointed that i did not receive v - belts that could have been purchased at the local parts store the same day for an entire week .
neutral	the failure to receive the belts at the same time as the water_pump , thermostat , and gaskets prevented returning my vehicle to service for several days .
neutral	not receiving my v - belts in a timely_fashion also caused me to purchase my alternator locally at a higher price and with less selection .
neutral	recently ordered the pool_cover wrap and pillow for winter covering .
neutral	at the time i could not find the pillow pal on your website so ordered just the two items .
neutral	items arrived in a timely_manner and was happy with that .
neutral	later called your company number and asked about the pillow pal to hold the pillow to the cover .
neutral	the lady could not find it on the site but knew the name of the item so she got it ordered for me .
neutral	good experience with the lady .
neutral	however , paying an $ 0 . 00 handling_charge on a $ 0 . 00 item seems to be just a bit much . to me .
neutral	selection / catalog is great , easy to order at website , but the size / quality of the items was not consistent .
neutral	also , they are pricey and do not offer any coupons or even free_shipping if you spend a signfiicant amount ( which i did ).
neutral	order early in the season since they do sell out of items .
neutral	not sure if i will order from them again .
neutral	petflow has many wonder toys various_types of food and treats both fordods and cats .
neutral	not liking the fact that you have to have produts shipped evrey couple of weeks .
neutral	good tech but way too expensive
neutral	some good deals but easy to be conned
neutral	love the photos but could only purchase one because the price was way too high !
neutral	can '_t you come down a little - you ' d probably get more folks to buy and want to buy more than one which might make them spend more anyway !
neutral	just a thought .
neutral	thanks for doing a great job !
neutral	great cd '_s but watch your invoices campared to money withdrawn to detect differences .
neutral	was charged shipping with suppose to be free .
neutral	had to call customer_service to straighten it out .
neutral	shouldn_'_t of had to do that .
neutral	this time the person_who did the work seemed to miss a lot of the conversation - it says inauditiable however you can hear it perfectly fine .
neutral	very disappointed this time has_been very good in the past -
neutral	can this be reviewed and corrected without another charge please .
neutral	thanks
neutral	linda was a peach when asked for help with our last order ...... and then all hell broke loose .
neutral	kept getting these crazy error_messages , called her back and she was at a loss as well , but just like any old trusty computer ... took out money $$$$.
neutral	now we have two memberships , but we did receive our order in great style by the usps .
neutral	thanx linda !
neutral	usually -- your service is great !
neutral	keep_up the good work
neutral	i had ordered four pearls necklaces and they were lovely ..
neutral	interests that the ones less_than 000 looks like the ones i paid 000 for .. a good deal .
neutral	if i see something on my credit_report i call identity_guard and they give me something different than one of the credit agency '_s says but they wont change it .
neutral	product ordered 00nd february ..
neutral	delivered 00th_april and charged extra for saturday delivery .
neutral	product quality vey good .
neutral	my son - in -_law was very pleased to receive the castelli biking jacket that i was able to track down for him from always riding .
neutral	however , it took 00 days for it to arrive , well past the holidays and its usefulness for biking in the cold northeast usa .
neutral	please do not advertise that shipping takes 0 - 0 days when in fact it took much longer .
neutral	also , the jacket that i ordered was featured with a free jersey on the castelli website but did not come with that from always riding , which was a disappointment .
neutral	i hope that my comments will be forwarded to always riding .
neutral	i have no problem with the quality of the goods supplied , my only issue was with the delivery by parcelforce who i have to say have gone down hugely in my estimation .
neutral	however i would like to say many_thanks to tara wilson who provided enormous help in getting my problem with parcelforce resolved .
neutral	this assistance was greatly_appreciated .
neutral	i was very happy with the invitations i ordered , but am not at all happy with the stickers i ordered .
neutral	i have put in for a return and still_haven_'_t heard from anyone .
neutral	you can not read the print on the stickers and am waiting for a full_refund .
neutral	i have however ordered some more with the writing on white hoping it will show up so we will see !
neutral	i just opened the package .
neutral	everything seemed fine but then the removable jar and base came apart .
neutral	i put it back together , but i '_m not sure if it was correct because there were no directions for assembly .
neutral	i won_'_t know until i have cleaned and sanitized the blender .
neutral	on the other hand , i received the product in a very timely_manner .
neutral	tracking was very easy and efficient .
neutral	i do very much like the shower fixtures we bought thru hudson_reed , but i had a couple problems with install and one particular item .
neutral	i don_'_t have international_calling on my cell_phone , so i was not able to call and speak with anyone .
neutral	the online live_chat has_been or at_least was unavailable during the couple weeks i was trying to resolve my issues .
neutral	i did use an_email contact and i did get a response , but it turned_out that the fix suggested was not ideal .
neutral	the wall plate for the shower controls does not screw to flatten flush against the wall .
neutral	the email suggestion i got was to putty the plate .
neutral	putty proved not good enough so we had to use a stronger adhesive and we had to also caulk around the plate .
neutral	not ideal but in the end it looks ok , tho could still be more flush to wall .
neutral	i also had just went past my 00 days from purchase , so i found the no return_policy after 00 days a bit too short of time .
neutral	i simply also needed a different size shower arm and wanted a simple exchange .
neutral	to keep all the fixtures the same , i was forced to buy a new arm .
neutral	so ultimately , tho the fixtures are beautiful and seem to be of high_quality , my ultimate experience in dealing_with this company will not be worth my returning .
neutral	which is really too bad .
neutral	i am a home stager and designer and i could have done a lot of business with this company had i just had a little better support and if they had a more realistic return and or exchange_policy .
neutral	as when you are remodeling an entire bathroom , often time runs over before all is installed , which was our case .
neutral	so 00 days was not enough to know we needed to change one part out .
neutral	if the books aren_'_t in perfect_condition , they won_'_t take them .
neutral	however , they have good customer_support .
neutral	jeg_har i et_par dage gjort brug af parkzonens parkering i mitchellsgade og også den såkaldte park & ride ordning , som_jeg syntes er rigtig godt tænkt .
neutral	men jeg syntes det_er problematisk at de 0 første kontrollører man render ind i i metroen dels ikke kender ordningen og tilmed stiller sig skeptisk til_den tilsendte sms billet .
neutral	det duer ikke , det_er ret ubehageligt at skulle stå og parlementere og prøve at overbevise om at billetten er god nok .
neutral	tænkte på om i hos parkzonen ( når i nu forhåbentlig på et tidspunkt læser dette ) ikke kunne gøre et eller andet .... evt .
neutral	tage fat i trafikselskaberne .
neutral	jeg_kan godt mærke at jeg hurtigt mister lysten til at benytte ordningen hvis_jeg bliver udsat for det samme en gang til , og_det_er ærgerligt for en ellers god ordning .
neutral	ellers er jeg ret tilfreds .... lidt ny belægning på michellsgades p plads er yderst tiltrængt , det_er jeg_ikke den eneste der syntes kan jeg se , og_der_er_ikke længere byggeplads og store lastbiler , så på med vanten ;-)
neutral	had no_issues with shipping or actual transaction .
neutral	the sizes ran very small and i got the hot_pink with rhinestones and it '_s very had to actually read the writing .
neutral	the booking was easy , the room has a lot of good points such as two flat screen tvs , a kitchen with a good sized refrigerator .
neutral	the bathroom is kind of small .
neutral	we overslept and left our room around lunch time .
neutral	when we returned , the room was as we left it with a pile of wet towels on the bathroom floor and unmade beds .
neutral	no one ever came in to clean the room .
neutral	i have nothing but praise off your company and service .
neutral	however , i thought i was ordering a weight_loss product for my dog and that is not what i received !
neutral	it is the product i ordered though .
neutral	don_'_t know where the confusion came from .
neutral	i cancel after 0 days , i needed 0 night instead of 0 and could not be accomindated i was told my reservation had to be cancelled .
neutral	i cancelled and had to call back after almost 0 hr because i did not receive a cancel confirmation when i returned call i was transferred to a tech specialist who sent a bet generic email for cancellation i hope it is cancel !
neutral	!
neutral	we went to the counter for eurocar at the station in strasbourg and no one was there .
neutral	we then had to go across the square to the other office .
neutral	we were also surprised that your offices are not open from 00 to 00h every day .
neutral	received my order on time but was disappointed when i noticed one of my item was opened i called at left message with customer_service but have not received a response yet and it '_s been 0 days past so i '_ll try again .
neutral	in the past it '_s been a good experience .
neutral	crystal
neutral	initially thought it was great idea .
neutral	i only received 0 companies who emailed me .
neutral	i asked you to redo and never received any more quotes .
neutral	the two quotes - one was super and i will choose them .
neutral	( prisma )
neutral	the other were wanting my phone details .
neutral	i said i just had a hiking accident and wanted to do everything by email .
neutral	they never responded again !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the 0 lights i got work fine , but i was charged for the 0 i ordered with no_explanation .
neutral	are they on backorder or what ?
neutral	that would be nice to know .
neutral	booking on viator is like playing russian roulette .
neutral	you never know if you '_ll win fabulously or get that horrific bullet .
neutral	most of my experiences have either been incredibly fantastic or desperately awful .
neutral	as you do not know who the provider of the tours are , there is no way to check reviews elsewhere to see if these tours are good or not , as many groups offer similar tours with similar itineraries .
neutral	the ones that are really good are amazing !
neutral	great tours guides , great itineraries , etc .
neutral	however , the really awful ones seem to falsely advertise the tour on viator .
neutral	those are the tours where what they promise on viator is not what actually happens on the tours .
neutral	i wish viator would screen tour companies more carefully before offering them to others .
neutral	or have some recourse for unhappy_customers to get compensated .
neutral	viator should also always show review from the latest reviews to the oldest , instead of the " best " to the " worst " as i find is the default setting .
neutral	by showing reviews that way , it is misleading to customers , making all the tours seem fantastic , when often some tours go downhill with time .
neutral	i found easy to book web_site easy to use however i was disappointed that they didnt take all major bank cards .
neutral	i had to get a friend to book on my behalf which did waste time and i could have lost out on the hotel that i was interested in .
neutral	i would use the site again .
neutral	i ordered 0 items three camping chairs and a sleeping_bag .
neutral	all were said to be in stock the chairs all arrived very quickly .
neutral	the sleeping_bag was to follow .
neutral	it didn_'_t , until i contacted company to ask where it was .
neutral	to be fair they responded very quickly with an_email and within two_days of my inquiry the sleeping_bag arrived .
neutral	so overall i would use the company again but perhaps the site needs to be undated a bit more frequently to ensure that out of stock items are correctly listed .
neutral	also think that they should have a better system for checking back orders and not wait for customers to email them .
neutral	this is a great place to buy parts but the shipping took to long and it wasn_'_t properly package .. wrapping the ends and putting a thin box around the round part isn_'_t package it should be in a boxed with bubble_wrap or peanuts ...
neutral	october_0000 - it took several_attempts to upload my files ( 0 different double sided business cards , 0 letterhead design and 0 comp slip design ) and the website didn_'_t acknowledge my ' job titles '.
neutral	it '_s great that i can collect from nearest branch so don_'_t have to wait in for delivery .
neutral	good prices for good print once you get past the website .
neutral	january_0000 - extra note .
neutral	just tried to upload a new print job - website lost connection again and can '_t finish sale , again !
neutral	the frames were the wrong color , and the tinting wasn_'_t dark enough on the sunglasses i bought , but i had no_problems getting a return_authorization for the glasses .
neutral	first time ordering from this website i was scared and seen all the reviews but i did so anyways .
neutral	all my questions was answer when i had problems with my order .
neutral	i got my necklace today and im really unhappy with it .
neutral	i can tell it was made in a rush .
neutral	i know you guys promise to get it here before christmas and you did so but everything is wrong with it .
neutral	the clasp for the necklace was made unproperly .
neutral	i couldn_'_t get my necklace on properly .
neutral	the plate is not properly support .
neutral	it could break very easy .
neutral	i will never order from this site again .
neutral	i shouldnt had in the first place and making sure my sister cancel her order today .
neutral	sorry my english is not all that good .
neutral	i have three large dogs and a cat .
neutral	my pets food is crucial to me because i can only purchase it in certain pet_stores .
neutral	i ordered the canidae all life stages and originally they told me tuesday for delivery and i was okay with that .
neutral	all of a sudden , it is tuesday and no food , and i emailed them and they told me it would be there by thursday .
neutral	i had to rush out during the 0th of july to purchase a small bag of food .
neutral	i also noticed that most of the treats and food is slighty more_expensive then if i purchase it in petsupermarket .
neutral	would i order again from petflow , maybe depending if i have a coupon or voucher .
neutral	i expected more mg '_s in the capsules , so i '_m taking more than just one .
neutral	boilerjuice are great , saves time shopping around for best price but - everytime i order , i ask them to phone to say when the delivery is being made , so that i can unlock the tank - but they never have yet !
neutral	i was impressed with the price as it was the cheapest i had found on the internet , the ordering took me a bit of time over the internet but this was no fault to the site it was perhaps my computer but when i called the office , the lady was very helpful .
neutral	the postage however i felt was quite slow , it did take some time to arrive after_placing the order .
neutral	if i needed the product in a hurry then i maybe would buy from somewhere_else .
neutral	i was not dissatisfied with the service from the company because when i did chase the product up i was sent a reply almost_immediately .
neutral	i was ordering an itunes_gift_card as a " gift ".
neutral	i was never given the opportunity to include an_email address for the gift recipient .
neutral	i '_m waiting to hear from customer_service to find out what can be done so that my gift can be sent to the appropriate person .
neutral	heelys are fine and daughter_loves them but they were a gift so was disappointed when she opened them to find that the sticker saying " do not remove " had been removed already and the paper and bags used for packaging were ripped so these had obviously been a return from a previous customer .
neutral	also , one of the metal eyelets to thread the lace through was loose .
neutral	difficult to take them off an excited 0 year_old to return though .
neutral	my service representative that i talked to did a great job .
neutral	however we experienced some difficulties with bill me later working correctly and finding airline_tickets .
neutral	really please with quality of furniture .
neutral	we purchased the french rustic farmhouse large bookcase , small bookcase and wide screen tv_unit .
neutral	we also purchased the french shabby chic dining_table and chairs plus the large sideboard .
neutral	one of the chairs was damaged .
neutral	we called customer_services straight_away .
neutral	they were rude and unhelpful .
neutral	we took photos of the damage and emailed then through immediately .
neutral	that was nearly a week_ago and we have heard_nothing since leaving us with an incomplete dining_set .
neutral	wonderful service .
neutral	would have ordered again accept for the fact that the item did not come boxed .
neutral	as it was a present , it certainly spoilt the occasion .
neutral	i was really pleased my part shipped in two_days ..
neutral	however when i was reading the return instructions i became worried ..
neutral	seemed like i was almost being told that i would receive my refund after 00 days or maybe not at all .
neutral	purchased the insurance and tracking says it was delivered within the return time but i have yet to be contacted ..
neutral	not great .
neutral	i got sent two of the same product .
neutral	had to waste time sending them back .
neutral	i was so excited to find your company and decided to give it a fair " shot "... which fell short of nespresso , in a few different_ways .
neutral	i purchased the full 00 pod min .
neutral	the plastic capsules do not comfortably fit in my machine and it takes brute force to pull the lever down in place .
neutral	i say a small prayer each and every time i force the lever .
neutral	the coffee '_s depth and perfect balance lacks .
neutral	for the few extra cents it costs to achieve the perfect espresso , i ' d_rather stick with my original nespresso product .
neutral	i hail you for trying and i do think you are getting close , but , so_far ... no cigar .
neutral	i love the designs and the american apparel clothing , but the quality of the print left a lot to be desired .
neutral	when i first got it , the print looked homemade .
neutral	almost returned it , but i loved the designs too much .
neutral	after one wash , the print already peeled off somewhat .
neutral	i was extremely disappointed and frustrated as i waited well over the 00 minute maximum completion time for my vehicle .
neutral	i was very clear in letting ethan know that i needed my car finished in that 00 minute time_frame as i had to be home for my kids to get off the bus from school .
neutral	i found it completely_unacceptable and very disrespectful for my car to take 00_minutes over the time it was promised to be done .
neutral	if i had known that this company had so little consideration for my time and family commitments i would never have taken my car to them .
neutral	this was my first time going there and will be the last .
neutral	i thought this company was perfect , but my husband told me that if , when we actually go to the place , it is not as_promised , even if it is terrible , booking . com insists that you pay for the whole time that you were committed to .
neutral	even the place itself can '_t let you leave .
neutral	that '_s nerve_wracking .
neutral	supplement_warehouse used to be my go - to supplement company because of their price - match_guarantee and fast shipping .
neutral	repeatedly , however , the company shipped me the wrong products -- wrong flavor protein_bars , missing boxes of protein_bars , wrong flavor protein_powder .
neutral	to their credit , they were great about sending me the correct products , but it became such a hassle that i gave up on them and took my business elsewhere .
neutral	i '_m giving them another chance , so hopefully they '_ve fixed their accuracy issues .
neutral	otherwise , it is a great company .
neutral	tje part i ordered would not fit my car .
neutral	i did however , used the parts that i needed and now i have new parts that can '_t be used .
neutral	it was easier to make do than to try to return item .
neutral	it took a little_bit longer to ship than i expected , processing the item is what took the longest , but got it eventually .
neutral	i ordered a size medium and the length of the dress wasnt as long as i wouldve liked it to be , but ill still wear it out and about during summer .
neutral	its a little bigger_than a regular size medium , i couldve gotten away with a small .
neutral	overall ill buy more clothes from 00dollarmall .
neutral	the appliance seems fine and not too noisy , delivery man was miserable ,
neutral	i am not pleased that they reviewed all my bills , said all credit_cards would be in the plan , with a set monthly amount withdrawn from my checking_account to go into the escrow account , then had an underwriter say that one account could not be included , but they left the amount that i ay each_month the same .
neutral	therefore i now pay what they set the amount at , and the other credit_card company separately , which makes my budget for household bills almost_impossible .
neutral	this does not seem fair .
neutral	i went on the plan because i was having_difficulty paying my bills , and even_though my bills will be paid sooner , i will still be under severe financial strain for 0 years till my debt is cleared .
neutral	i just started the program so i cannot say how they are at settling debts .
neutral	great range of goods at competitive_prices and good communication but lordy the delivery is slow .
neutral	maybe this is only a problem in ni ?
neutral	i made two purchases within two_days of each other .
neutral	the first went_smoothly and i love the jeans and top :) shipping was quick and arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	i was thrilled .
neutral	the second i still have not received almost a week_later .
neutral	i sent email with a returned confirmation_email from them saying they respond within 00_hrs .
neutral	it now has_been longer_than the time they specified , and still no word .
neutral	they did debit my card for the order and have not refunded or even stated as to why the order was not shipped .
neutral	it is a shame as i sincerely was going to make this my new go to place for shopping .
neutral	please use skepticism when shopping here .
neutral	i never give bad ratings , but on the second order i feel_like my money was just_plain and simply stolen .
neutral	so frustrating !
neutral	update to this :
neutral	i wrote this review and received items in the mail later that day :) i apologize for not giving this a little more time , although i was not given a tracking_number or anything except the original confirmation_email .
neutral	as with the first order , the items i received were perfect and fit great .
neutral	my trust is restored in this company .
neutral	i designed my wedding_ring online with natural_sapphire company " s help and chose a pink saphire cushion_cut as my center_stone .
neutral	gorgeous stone but i was not as impressed with the halo type setting - it was supposed to be a copy of a henri daussi setting i admired in the store .
neutral	copy yes but not as beautifully set as the brand_name .
neutral	it was a ' chunkier ' setting -- was trying to save a little_bit of money with the custom built ring but i was disappointed in the actual setting .
neutral	i will eventually take the stone out and do a much_simpler setting .
neutral	if i were at the new_york store i would have chose an already made setting so i would have know what i was getting .
neutral	if you must get a custom setting ask to see the wax mold before you have it cast ( which i did not ).
neutral	ok - that said - the stone is breathtaking and i looked at about 0 other stones on preview - which were fedexed to me from the store .
neutral	amazing quality stones - no other jewelry store could match the quality for the price .
neutral	after i received the stone i took it to my local jewelry store for a look and even the store was impressed with the quality of stone .
neutral	customer_service was first rate and answered every_single email i had - which were a lot - i was do nervous_about ordering online !
neutral	my only_gripe was that we ordered a few_weeks before valentines_day and it was not ready till after - about two_days_later .
neutral	i would buy a stone from the company again but would only buy setting after i saw it completed .
neutral	i bought previously and they were delicious and fully trim .
neutral	the crab cakes are fantastic .
neutral	it took a weel in a half to get my part .
neutral	i ordered two parts a neither one were on time .
neutral	the repairman showed_up on time and was friendly and knowledgeable .
neutral	after he left it took several days for the replacement part on the washing_machine to get ordered .
neutral	unbelievable .
neutral	i was then told that the part would arrive in 0 - 0 business days and they would call me when the part came in .
neutral	i called a week_later and found out that the part was there but no one had bothered to call to schedule an_appointment as_promised .
neutral	it took over 0_weeks for my machine to get fixed and that '_s a lot of laundry dragged to the laundromat .
neutral	i love the products on here but i only order if i can wait for the items ......
neutral	the delivery prosess is so slow !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	transaction day + 0 days to arrive at bank_account ?
neutral	locked in to contract ' till 0000 but money will take four days to arrive at the bank , unless we banked with natwest .
neutral	why ?
neutral	i think after you '_ve purchased your order it gets confusing how to redeem them etc . also the wallet part makes no sense to me atall as i '_ve brought a lot from wow get already i think there should be a loyalty_scheme
neutral	booking the reservations was quick and easy but calling afterward for a question about the booking was painful .
neutral	i don_'_t know if that was the booking site or the hotels issue but the person i spoke to at the main reservation number was completely clueless .
neutral	they gave conflicting information while speaking to the same agent .
neutral	i then called my hotel_directly and the initial reservation person i spoke to could not find my reservation or answer my questions when we suddenly got disconnected , hmmmmm .
neutral	i called back and the person that answered found my reservation immediately and answered all my questions .
neutral	if only i had gotten her initially , i could have saved a lot of time .
neutral	the person on the phone was nice , but it took a really long time to accomplish
neutral	what needed to be done .
neutral	i was on hold for about 00_minutes .
neutral	i was impressed at the great service from buying to receiving the product .
neutral	i was less impressed when i realised that the glasses had come from hong_kong .
neutral	not because i was bothered about buying from hong_kong but because it seemed deceitful .
neutral	i believed that the company was a nz company and governed by nz cga etc , so that if anything went wrong , i would be covered .
neutral	there was no information on the website to tell me that in fact the glasses were coming from hong_kong and that it was a chinese company .
neutral	i prefer honesty in my dealings
neutral	i loved the boots and the jeans i ordered , however , the two shirts and the shorts i ordered i was very dissatisfied with !
neutral	definitely need more buyer friendly descriptions on their items .
neutral	i ordered this on the 00th and still have not received the order .
neutral	i probably will not use your website again at_least amazon delivers timely .
neutral	i was disappointed with my reservations for flight and hotel combined in one transaction .
neutral	i was lead to believe i would get a better rate if i combined the bookings .
neutral	turns_out i had to pay an outrageous hotel fee and it is also nonrefundable .
neutral	not sure i would ever use travelocity again .
neutral	i ordered a book at a higher price point after_speaking with one of bookbytes customer_service folks who said the books over $_000 ( the title i was purchasing ) included the disks ( 0 discs were to come with the book ).
neutral	i only received 0 disk , fortunately i already had the software that was on the other disc .
neutral	the service was quick and painless and i will_definitely purchase from bookbyte again .
neutral	websites are easy to reade , and as a fin , it ´_s nice to have it also in my language to make shopping easy !
neutral	thank u for that .
neutral	i wish that all of your item infos could be in finnish .
neutral	but my order arrived in just 0 days , so i ´_m very pleaced with that , and just ordered a new kit to try ...
neutral	there is only one thing i was bit disappointed , there was two manual batteries instead of one of each ( manual and automatic ), as was written in discription ... but maby it was a mistake ?
neutral	well have a nice springtime and keep_up a good customerservice !
neutral	:)
neutral	hostelworld is easy to navigate and to find a hostel that suites your needs for your trip ; however , i booked a hostel in barcelona through hostelword , and i was charged a € 0 . 00 service charge .
neutral	when we reached the hostel though they told us that their receipt showed that i had only been charged a € 0 . 00 service charge .
neutral	it is only a € 0 . 00 cent difference , but still the discrepancy is there .
neutral	our hostel also told us that hostelworld is changing its policies , and if hostels pay a certain fee to the website then their ratings will be listed first , even if they are not one of the actual top_rated hostels , rated by users .
neutral	pay_attention before you book !
neutral	it was quick and easy to process the information
neutral	this is my 0st order with boohoo . com and needed a few casual cardigand and so the kate pocket jersey cardigans and order 0 different_colours for my waldrobe .
neutral	ordered the m / l size and they didn_'_t fit all .
neutral	was quite shocked .
neutral	i am a size 00 and l / xl may have fitted well , but boohoo . com does not have the size for me to re - order .
neutral	the quailty was soft and wearable with any casual wear .
neutral	dispappointed and had to return all three items .
neutral	ordered the bom bom beanie , was disappointed with the quality and also it did not fit my head with the braids .
neutral	couldn_'_t get it on , so this has_been returned as well .
neutral	the only item i kept was the black madison bow headnband .
neutral	this will keep my ears wram for the winter ahead .
neutral	really nice and a good pick to find .
neutral	delivery was not good as they said they attempted a delivery , but i was home as i am recovering from an operation .
neutral	that was a bit_annoying as a letter was then sent and had to book a delivery slot and dail an 0000 number which costs .
neutral	madness .
neutral	when parcel arrived , i would say the packaging was no great at all .
neutral	will order again with boohoo in the near_future ...... when i need something_else for the waldrobe !!
neutral	!
neutral	placed order on feb . 00th , 0000 , according to site the order was shipped via_fedex on feb . 00th , 0000 .
neutral	checked fedex_tracking on march 0nd , 0000 via online and it was stated that delivery was to be mar .
neutral	0th , 0000 .
neutral	by 0 : 00 mar .
neutral	0th when nothing was received i once again checked on line and found that my delivery date had been updated to reflect " n / a ".
neutral	by fri . afternoon the fedex_tracking still reflected " n / a ", so i then contacted petflow and spoke with cheryl @ 0 : 00_pm pst on 0 . 0 . 00 .
neutral	cheryl offered to contact fedex and had a trace put on our order .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive another call from cheryl , but i did receive a text_message from fedex stating my order would be delivered 0 . 00 . 00 , which it was .
neutral	unfortunately the box wasn_'_t sealed well and a part of my order was damaged and one part was missing all together .
neutral	i don_'_t anticipate using this service anytime_soon .
neutral	i have never dealt_with a company before that sends me the completely wrong order and then when i email them they apologize and give send a shipping label but they don_'_t do anything to compensate for their mistake like give me 00 more of the product for free with a different design or anything like 00_%_off your next order with no expiration_date , i '_m not very happy with them .
neutral	i '_ve booked two_separate trips recently and have not received email_confirmation for either one .
neutral	i had to contact travelocity for a confirmation , but feel i shouldn_'_t have to do that .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received a confirmation for a trip i booked yesterday , even after i emailed customer_service and the itinerary_number i got when i booked doesn_'_t work when i try to look up the reservation .
neutral	this is very frustrating to me .
neutral	i did airfare and car_rental , no_issues with air but car_rental was not acceptable , i went with avis as travelocity had an offer via avis to get upgraded two levels , when i got there the agent was not friendly told me they did not have any to give and was very rude about it , then walking to my car another avis employee ran a stop sign and caused me to hit the ground with luggage to not get hit and he did not stop to help or apologize even when he saw what he did , car was old and dirty on top of everything else , will not be using avis again
neutral	0 lights do not light up .
neutral	i '_ve e_mailed but no reply as yet
neutral	i ordered four clothing items from yesstyle , and i was pretty pleased with three of them .
neutral	however , the quality of the fourth item ( a black skirt from a taiwanese brand ) was really bad - the stitching inside the skirt was faulty , and two of the buttons came right off in my hands !
neutral	plus , the skirt came with an attached tag that still had the price sticker on it .
neutral	when i converted the currencies i realized that the price on the tag was much lower_than the price i had paid .
neutral	the skirt was most definitely not worth the price advertised on yesstyle , and i feel ripped_off for paying that much for such a shoddy item .
neutral	i won_'_t be returning my purchased clothes because i ' d_rather not deal with the details of international shipping and refunds .
neutral	however , i don_'_t think i '_ll be shopping with yesstyle again , since i ' d prefer all of my items to be of decent quality .
neutral	i ordered a deluxe bunch of yellow and pink_roses called " congratulations ", also under " bestsellers " and " mothers_day " flowers on the floraqueen website , and assured that since they were roses , no substitution will take place .
neutral	the flowers my mother received were completely different : pale , long - stemmed , not overly abundant combination of a few white_roses , pink carnations and some other flower of which i can '_t remember the name .
neutral	she was happy , though she called it
neutral	" sweet ", whilst i had spent some time choosing a bunch which i thought would be fun , fizzy , and colourful , and " deluxe ".
neutral	it does make a mockery of the customer , presented with the rather elaborate catalogue of choices , when it proves the local flower shops do whatever they choose to send , regardless .
neutral	love the price i got for the room and not knowing which hotel you get until booking is complete .
neutral	discovered priceline . com rate for hotels on accident !!
neutral	just wish i could have picked bed preference and non_- smoking_room .
neutral	best pricing for hotel verses hotwire . com , was really surprised .
neutral	the hotels that are picked like the business but not the pricing that is given through third_party .
neutral	you are treated and reminded you are a third_party booker ...!
neutral	ouch , i can '_t help i want to save on cost of hotel .
neutral	heck , what do you expect for a family that is homeless !
neutral	gotta save all we can !!
neutral	thanks pricleline . com , you helped saved our family very expensive cost that we didn_'_t have and much_better_than staying in grimy motels !!
neutral	again , thank_you !
neutral	!
neutral	delivery was quick .
neutral	communication was good .
neutral	however , they took no notice of the delivery instructions i left when placing the order .
neutral	i know these were received ok as it was in my email_confirmation .
neutral	however , i was out when they delivered .
neutral	they didn_'_t leave it in the safe place i had specified .
neutral	so i had to re - arrange delivery .
neutral	ironically , to the safe place i had told them to leave it in in the first place !
neutral	the clothes are not that bad , but they did come a little too big for me .... but i still lyk them .
neutral	my favorite thing that i got from there was the two - in - one ( liquid / solid ) eyeliner .
neutral	i liked the bag that i bough but i guess i could get better quality for the price
neutral	i bought some products and i have to say that is not bad
neutral	i have used etyres for a while now but sadly felt let_down this time as i booked for the morning as going out then rang to say tyre not available until the afternoon . fitted in the dark , not as happy as usual . usually reliable .
neutral	falta traducción al español en indicaciones de que uno se baje y que_se acabaron las rutas para saber que ya se termina el paseo y tardan mucho en llegar , que a uno lo bajen en una parada para pasarlo a otro camión no me pareció muy agradable .
neutral	not really impressed with the ticketing system as it dosent download very well came printed out in 0 spread out pages
neutral	and dosesnt seem very professional in fact i am wondering_if it is a legitamte ticket !
neutral	!
neutral	i am very satisfied with what i paid in order to rent this text book compared to what the bookstore was originally asking for .
neutral	however , considering i settled for the older edition the amount of wear , the overall condition , and especially the amount of writing and distracting highlighting in the text is unsatisfactory .
neutral	i bought this product out of desperation on my cat was over grooming himself .
neutral	i did not want to put him on prozac and this was last resort before that .
neutral	i ordered my stethoscope because of the enticement of laser_engraving free of charge which i am very pleased .
neutral	however , i realized after i had ordered i forgot to check the box to get the free student information from littman .
neutral	i tried_calling the day after i placed my order and couldn_'_t get through so i tried using the live_chat and couldn_'_t get through so i sent an e_- mail with my request for the information for the free student pack .
neutral	still no response .
neutral	i again tried_calling and the phone system would not recognize any of my options i entered and could not get through to a live_person .
neutral	after several tries i did finally get through to someone on live_chat which seemed as though i was ignored with long pauses between conversation to finally get what i needed .
neutral	this last order the ink ran_out so fast i am trying someone_else .
neutral	i also got the black_ink all over my bathrobe .
neutral	it just ran right out after i removed the
neutral	orange covering .
neutral	thank_god it missed the carpeting !
neutral	then in no time at
neutral	all , i needed another order .
neutral	i had been happy with things , but the last
neutral	two orders were terrible .
neutral	i like bedeck products but there is no retailer where i live so i have to purchase online .
neutral	considering there is a p_& p charge unless you spend so much they are very slow at delivering .
neutral	the same day i ordered from bedeck i purchased a large item from an ebay_seller .
neutral	the seller charged no p_& p and although estimated delivery was a week it took 0 days .
neutral	this company took a week .
neutral	very annoying !
neutral	price and service was above_average but part feel apart within 0 day .
neutral	the mirror feel out of the frame the first time i tried to manually adjust it .
neutral	getting back to the company can only be done by email .
neutral	i have ordered many parts from partsgeek . com .
neutral	i have just received an order and it was not complete .
neutral	have no way of getting in touch with them .
neutral	have tried_calling , e_- mailing and tried several_times to fill_out customer_support_ticket to no_avail
neutral	part was to received by monday 0 / 00 / 00 .... ups left a note on a neighbors door saying it needed to be signed for .
neutral	neighbor brought sheet to us and left a note on their door saying ups was at the wrong residence .
neutral	after 0 days and 0 phone_calls and 0 emails the package had been left at a church on our road !!!!!!
neutral	at a church on the same road ...... what is wrong with this picture ????????
neutral	i will buy parts again but i will demand shipping other than ups - they are way too lame to be entrusting expensive products to ......
neutral	i receive my orders fine .
neutral	but the product comes damaged .
neutral	like the kitty_litter .
neutral	it all over the bottom of the packing box
neutral	i love being_able to utilize bookit . com because i can link up my bill me later account , and make monthly_payments on my travel / hotel / etc .
neutral	this is great for those of us who do not always have cash available to get away on our vacations , so for this option , i am grateful for bookit . com .
neutral	i went through a tedious process of checking the website over the past couple weeks to try and get the best deal i could on a highly rated hotel in las_vegas .
neutral	i finally found a great deal last night , and was in the process of booking three_nights at the luxor !!
neutral	i was so excited because not only was i getting a great nightly rate , they had a $_00 food credit from the hotel which was included as a bonus , and also a free $_000 restaurant . com gift_certificate !!!
neutral	this made the deal even sweeter because it meant that we could maybe eat two meals during our vacation for close to nothing .
neutral	so , i went through the booking process and when i got to the last page it said , in very small_print , " make_sure to opt for the restaurant gift_card when you are completing your booking in order to receive it ."
neutral	so , from that page forward i kept scanning every inch of the screen to click on the restaurant . com gift_card .
neutral	well , i never found the option , and the reservation closed itself out .
neutral	i could not get back in to make any changes , or to search harder for the restaurant . com option .
neutral	well , i opened up a new bookit . com page and started a new booking just to see if i had missed it .
neutral	the disappointing fact was that the restaurant . com gift_card option was on the page prior to where it gave_me the warning to add it on !!
neutral	this made me incredibly sad , and i felt major bummed .
neutral	there was no way to remedy this matter because i had already completed my first booking , and paid for it .
neutral	i believe that bookit . com needs to be much more clearer with people creating bookings about the bonuses , or the special add_ons .
neutral	had i received this warning or special instructions prior to the page that actually had the restaurants . com gift_card option on it , i would have seen it .
neutral	it was almost like they didn_'_t want me to find it , so they didn_'_t really have to give away a $_000 gift_card .
neutral	so , in the end , i appreciate the fact that bookit . com accepts my bill me later account , which gives someone_who is on a budget many more options and opportunities to be able to take vacations .
neutral	i did not appreciate the fact that bookit . com did not help me take_advantage of all the bonuses / freebies that i could have gotten .
neutral	i spent over $_000 on this booking , and that $_000 gift_card would have been an amazing addition .
neutral	please , bookit . com , help your customers by providing instructions before the customer misses out .
neutral	i ordered online 0 x pirelli tyres because of their fuel efficiency and wet weather rating , i booked my mobile_fitting day .
neutral	the day before the fitting i received a phone_call to say the pirelli '_s would be a few extra days and would i accept continental tyres instead , because i needed the tyres urgently i accepted the substitute .
neutral	however , i think that when you order a specific tyre the computer system should be able to check for my area mobile fitter and tell me there and then if they are not available .
neutral	that way i could decide_whether to continue with my purchase or not .
neutral	i don_'_t like tyre_fitting garages , as they take for ages when you turn up and surprisingly nearly always sell you a tyre you don_'_t want .
neutral	either have the tyres in stock or don_'_t advertise them on the website .
neutral	the shoes were delivered really quickly , which was great .
neutral	but when i tried the shoes on i noticed that the eyelet on the right hand side of the right shoe was missing .
neutral	there was just a whole in the fabric .
neutral	as it is the very last whole my trousers cover that part , which is why i didn_'_t return the shoes .
neutral	it '_s more likely to be a manufacturing fault anyway as the shoes clearly hadn_'_t been used / worn before i received them
neutral	i used bookit . com last_year for a trip to nyc , and had no_issues with my hotel reservation .
neutral	however , i just booked my hotel for an_upcoming_trip to san_diego later this month and have encountered several problems .
neutral	first , i was trying to book two different_types of rooms ( one for me , and another for my sister ), but the system only defaults to both rooms being the same .
neutral	i called and the customer representative at bookit . com told me i needed to do two_separate transactions if i wanted to have different_types of rooms ( e . g_., king vs . queen suite ).
neutral	other_sites ( such as orbitz ) allow you to select the type of room for each room that you are booking .
neutral	anyway , i did that over the phone with a representative ( megan ) and she read back the prices to me , with my sister '_s room being almost $_00 cheaper because there are fewer people in the room .
neutral	when i received the confirmation emails , i noticed that both rooms were charged the same price .
neutral	i called to correct this , and the process of talking to a representative and being put on hold took about 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	i was told by romie , another customer representative , that the remaining credit would show up on my credit_card .
neutral	he also mentioned i would receive an_email_confirmation that this took place .
neutral	however , the correction has not been made yet and i did not get an_email .
neutral	if i had not read the contract in detail , i may never have noticed the wrong amount that was charged .
neutral	i was assuming since the customer representative read the prices to me , it was accurate .
neutral	and i '_m not sure why it is taking so long to correct the amount when the charges appeared quickly , but the credit seems to take longer ( unlike my experiences with other_sites ).
neutral	also , having to spend 00 - 00_minutes on hold and explaining the situation to the customer representative without_any results is frustrating .
neutral	i was so pleased with all the clothes purchased but was disgusted that there was chewed up chewing gum on the outer_packaging of the clothes inside the bag .
neutral	if i didn_'_t like the clothes so much the while lot would have gone back in the same packaging along with the chewing gum .
neutral	it was the first time i '_ve purchased from boohoo n doubt i will use again soon , but would again if the chewing gum issue would be recognised n resolved .
neutral	while we have used the company before and probably would again if we new there was not going to be any weather issues .
neutral	on day 0 of our 0 day tickets it rained in london .
neutral	to get a seat or a spot on a bus was extremely difficult .
neutral	wait times were 00 - 00_min and it was standing room only and very difficult when someone wanted to get off as they wont open the back door .
neutral	the gentlemen that stand at each area to get folks to sign_up that are walking by on the sidewalk are extremely pushy and the one outside of buckingham_palace stop on oct 0th was down right rude .
neutral	he must have known they werent coming for at_least 00_min because he disappeared while we all stood in the rain waiting for the bus .
neutral	then bam showed_up when the bus arrived .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery but because the order was placed after 0 it didn_'_t arrive for 0 days - if you are not able to fulfil next_day delivery you should advise when order is placed and be given chance to change delivery option .
neutral	i bought a body protector on - line for my daughter .
neutral	when it arrived , it didn_'_t fit so i tried to return it to the nearest_store .
neutral	i was told that the terms and conditions state that safety equipment cannot be returned .
neutral	the item was clearly completely unworn and the sales_assistant was very helpful and ultimately agreed to a full_refund on this basis , whilst making it clear that go outdoors did not have to do this .
neutral	whilst i accept the reasons for the policy and that this is probably in the terms and conditions , go must be aware that few people read the fine_print first , and need to make it much more visible , when buying safety equipment , that they will not accept_returns .
neutral	this does make it virtually_impossible to buy this on - line though .
neutral	tv ordered and awaiting info re delivery .
neutral	some days_later there was a card from yodel saying they had called and tried to deliver my item and could i re - schedule .
neutral	no information had every been given that they would be delivering on that day .
neutral	called the cust helpline - changed the suggested date from thur to sat ..... and then received 0 different phone_calls to give me a slot on thurs .... 0 times i told them it was sat ...... and the delivery driver called outside my house on the fri to ask where i was !!!
neutral	they did come_back and deliver that evening once i was home from work - but the free sound bar was missing
neutral	i switched away from fcr . com when i realized they had my score all wrong .
neutral	their mistake caused me to negotiate for my recent car purchase thinking my credit_score was about 000 pts lower_than it actually was !
neutral	i love the car i bought , but i '_m sure i could have negotiated better terms .
neutral	this seems like a decent service , although it would be nice if there were more robust planning tools , although i realize that isn_'_t exactly_what this service is for .
neutral	the only other complaint i have is that your app is not compatible with android 0 . 0 .
neutral	key lime pie will be out in a couple months ... may want to hurry up on that , lest you look out of touch with recent tech , which i would think an identity_theft prevention service would want to avoid .
neutral	the pricing is good , however the shipping on the free items increases to the point that they aren_'_t free_samples .
neutral	this is my second order , with all the info on the free_samples i would get i expected something in my first order .
neutral	nothing came .
neutral	i see now at my second order that you have to select the free_samples that you get , again this ups the shipping cost .
neutral	the site isn_'_t the easiest to use .
neutral	in all nothing earth shakingly different from a few of the other_sites i have used .
neutral	just a lower base price for the same product .
neutral	ordered a part that wasn_'_t in my opinion what it was suppose to be and couldn_'_t get a reply to return for 0 days .
neutral	unfortunately , the part i ordered by the name my mechanic told me to get wasn_'_t event associated with the egr valve in my mom '_s car !
neutral	if they had online_chat or would answer their phones properly ( you can '_t tell me 00_mins ) is a decent time to hold , when , in fact , no one ever picked_up the call !
neutral	couldn_'_t take waiting that long .
neutral	tried several_times .
neutral	not happy with customer_service .
neutral	yes , they have the best price on parts , but maybe paying a little more will help by getting someone to address issues on what to order or return !
neutral	!
neutral	i wanted to order two replacement aqua jogging belts .
neutral	i googled that and clicked on your site , happy to have found just what i wanted at a very reasonable price .
neutral	while on the site i wanted to see what else you had , so looked at one or two other screens .
neutral	when i checked out i found that in addition to the replacement belts two girls ' swimsuits were listed , although not included in the total , so i clicked purchase .
neutral	it looked like a small box with a question mark was to the left of each item .
neutral	i figured that you were " suggesting " other items i might want to buy .
neutral	to my horror , you sent me the two suits , bringing our $_00 . 00 order to $_00 . 00 .
neutral	this is surely a glitch in the website , as i definitely did not order and do not want these suits .
neutral	i was pleased , however , that when i called to report your mistake the young_woman took_care of it right_away by issuing me a prepaid return packaging label , saying that a refund would be issued as soon as they got the suits back .
neutral	i ordered two dresses for a wedding for my teenage_daughter sizing was very big and the colours and quality were not what they looked like on line so returned both for refund .
neutral	would not chance ordering any more .
neutral	at first i was happy with wowcher ...
neutral	but in the short time i have been on 0 items have not arrived ... one after already being requested my address a second time !!!
neutral	on emailing for a resolution i have had no contact or refund ...
neutral	i am still_awaiting something to be done .
neutral	i started a very happy customer - but now i am just frustrated and feel i am receiving poor customer_service - or rather no customer_service !
neutral	es_una muy_buena forma de elegir hostal .
neutral	le falta poder reservar distintas piezas de una sola vez .
neutral	works well with magimix machine which i was initially apprehensive qbput
neutral	bought a re manufactured power brake booster for a 00 chevy pickup and it was wont fit up right only sideways but my uncle is gonna do some rigging with the brackets to make it fit , if he put it on the way it was sent to him it would be mounted on sideways .
neutral	seems all are being rebuilt this way , this is not the first one we bought this way from another parts company .
neutral	but overall thanks for fast shipping .
neutral	i order these cookies ( biscuits ) from one that a friend brought me on his flight from dubai u . a . e .
neutral	the one he brought was crawford '_s bourbon creams that had vanilla fillings .
neutral	it tasted much_better_than the chocolate ones that i received in my order .
neutral	i just wish y ' all had the option for a speedier shipping it '_s been two_weeks , i still_haven_'_t received my items .
neutral	placed an order with molarclean and the ordering was very easy .
neutral	had problems with the delivery i . e .
neutral	they didn_'_t arrive even_though i had an_email_stating that they ' d been dispatched .
neutral	when i emailed them to see if they had really been dispatched i was sent an_email_asking me to call a mobile number .
neutral	this email was sent to others that had presumably had problems with their orders too and all email_addresses were on show ... breaking data protection act i think .
neutral	the tooth brush_heads were sent recorded post in the end and arrived .
neutral	they are not braun ones but molarclean '_s own make .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting that .
neutral	the web_site today having read it does state molarclean '_s own ones though , so don_'_t know if it '_s been updated .
neutral	anyway i will try them and see how they compare .
neutral	any_problems and i will send them back .
neutral	if they are ok i may order again in the future .
neutral	i love my glasses from frames_direct .
neutral	they are all i thought they would be and more .
neutral	i can not express how happy i am with my glasses .
neutral	with that said , i did encounter issues with shipping .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	my local post_office lost my purchase .
neutral	after several phone_calls and emails , two_weeks_later , i received my original purchase .
neutral	but not without confronting frames_direct about the shipping mishap .
neutral	with that said : frames_direct , after i asked for a refund of my money , ( because online purchases can be such a hassle , right ?)
neutral	tried to make good by offering me another set of glasses , which would have been shipped out overnight with ups .
neutral	like i said , it did not have to come to that , and i received my original purchase in the mail , but two_weeks_later than the tracking_number indicated .
neutral	i feel the website could be more user_friendly and it wouldn_'_t let_me book my travel_plans .
neutral	i had to call in to a representative who kept messing up what i was telling her and trying to tell me the flight i wanted suddenly wasn_'_t there when the final booking time came , ( although i was simultaneously on other travel sites due to my concern i would not be able to complete the transaction with her and the flight was still quite clearly there ).
neutral	this did not give me any confidence in the service and i was truly expecting the worse .
neutral	thankfully the worst part was booking it .
neutral	the trip itself went very smoothly and everything was in order .
neutral	they should really allow you to book your reservation yourself online where you can see exactly_what you ' re getting and not be forced to deal with people of questionable capability .
neutral	well i placed this order on sept 0 and it took00 days to get here , recieved it on the 00th , i thought i ordered beagle air freshners i got pug ones instead , no info on returning anything . cindy
neutral	i purchased the ostomy hole cutter in order to stop using scissors , but the cutter only succeeds in making a small impression in the wafer , i still have to use scissors to cut out the hole .
neutral	i will_continue to search the web in order to find something that will work .
neutral	i did place one order and it was delivered when they said it would be .
neutral	everything was packed very well .
neutral	their prices are quite high , however .
neutral	i have found the blue_buffalo dog and cat_food cheaper almost everywhere_else , i guess you have to pay for the convenience of home delivery .
neutral	all in all , i don_'_t think it is worth the extra money .
neutral	the xl poster prints i ordered were good quality and great value for money , but the packaging was damaged on arrival .
neutral	the tubes had been bashed inwards , leaving creases .
neutral	i have tried to contact jessops photo but the email on the website doesn_'_t work and i can '_t seem to get through on the phone as i would like to have a replacement print .
neutral	products are excellent , ordered stuff on sunday_night , asked for next_day delivery , expecting stuff to arrive on tuesday !
neutral	had to phone up to ask what had happened to order , was told that it '_s actually a 0 day delivery service not next_day !
neutral	definetly not happy , spent all day waiting for parcel !
neutral	maybe you should change delivery description , very misleading
neutral	not real happy with them right now 0 months and counting , beginning to wonder_if i will ever get the part !
neutral	i can '_t_believe i was charged $_00 . 00 postage for the product .
neutral	the product was displayed in a slim black box , yet on delivery was presented in a plastic_bag , very disappointed .
neutral	i '_m happy with the spectacles , vision and quality is sound .
neutral	however the delivery time was painful .
neutral	would recommend if you ' re not in a hurry !
neutral	guide qui ne comprend pas tj son client .
neutral	repond oui a vos questions , mais n en fait qu a sa tete .
neutral	vous lui dites que vous desirez manger dans des petits restos et il vous emmene dans des selfs pour touristes en bus ( afin que lui puisse manger gracieusement ).
neutral	decide avec_le chauffeur , sans vous en faire la traduction .
neutral	vous amene pour une visite supplementaire au programme , sans en avoir discuter au prealable et_la moindre balade est payante .
neutral	exemple d une belle balade en barque , au tarif de 00_euros la barque .
neutral	on nous considere comme des pigeons qu il faut plumer un max !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i recently_purchased a product from this company that required refrigeration at all times .
neutral	it was shipped un - refrigerated .
neutral	i then called the products company to find out if this product was still usable .
neutral	they informed me that pure_formulas . com was not authorized to sell this product online .
neutral	i called customer_service and they sent me a prepaid return shipping label .
neutral	waiting for my refund .
neutral	i placed an order once a couple months_ago .
neutral	it was for a high low ombre skirt and it was half off , they were having some promotion .
neutral	the skirt was cute but i didn_'_t like the material and it was kinda big on me , because it was on sale i couldn_'_t return or exchange :(.
neutral	the site is pretty nice but the prices are way over done .
neutral	i just saw some shorts on there for $_00 when g stage love has it for $_00 .
neutral	i see that a lot , plus they take_forever to restock and sell out of my sizes quick .
neutral	i placed my first order with them a few_months_ago .
neutral	the items were of pretty good quality but the good thing about the company is the prices are so cheap and they ' re selling a lot of things found on gojane and 0000ave and urbanog for way less , the only things is the cothes go out of stock fast , there '_s not a huge_selection , they could provide more details such as percentage of material that the clothes are made of , what size the model is wearing , how to care for the cothes , and they don_'_t accept_returns , just store credit , which is the main_reason_why i haven_'_t bought anything_else from them , what if you can '_t find anything_else you want ?
neutral	well , i '_ve been buying from ami for over a year now , i usually buy things i don_'_t see elsewhere , or that is sold out , like simple maxi_dresses for cheap and jumpsuits ( that are pricey ) and i must_say the quality is pretty good but there '_s so much that '_s not so good ..... the shipping is sky_high and they are constantly having promotions ( i think because some of their prices and shipping ) but you can '_t combine the two .
neutral	then once last_year , i ordered two things , one came in the mail , i emailed them for weeks and called receiving no help and finally they send me an_email_stating my refund was issued because they were sold out of that item , yet it was listed .
neutral	i was very disappointed and frustrated that i didn_'_t buy from them for a long time .
neutral	also they don_'_t accept_returns ( when more and more huge stores have changed that policy ), i don_'_t like that and that '_s why i hesitate to buy from them .
neutral	plus their clothes sell out fast and they don_'_t restock until months after the fact .
neutral	the site itself is hell .
neutral	theres thousands of products but when you type in " leopard crop " polka_dot leggings are also popping up , the site has a great design but it needs serious upgrading .
neutral	they definitely need major changes .
neutral	because the promotions and shipping of every other popular trendy site is going to win me over every time .
neutral	well , i think they have some really cute_clothes but their prices are too high for a full time student , such as myself and i once ordered a dress for $_00 and it was horrible .
neutral	the black and white saints and sinners dress .... the top part was stretchy but the bottom part was unflattering , stiff , and the material was not good , it should '_ve been stretchy like the top part .
neutral	then it was pulling or whatever its called when it seems as though the stitching is coming out .
neutral	so my thing is , expensive clothes ..... you ' re really just paying for the name tag because i see items on the site that are on gojane for $_00 and nasty gal has it for $_00 .
neutral	call me cheap but i '_m not paying more for something made of the same material .
neutral	is it really worth it ?
neutral	that dress wasn_'_t .
neutral	the only_reason_why i gave 0_stars because i love the design of the sight and the selection of clothes .
neutral	well , i '_ve been ordering from them for over a year now and i love their style variety , meaning you can be preppy , party girl , school girl , and sophisticated and chic .
neutral	i love that they have x - smalls too and around christmas they shipped my things within 0 days to get it before christmas , which is amazing .
neutral	but their sizing is wayyyyy off , in bottoms specifically .
neutral	their quality can be an_issue too , depends on what you buy , but their jeans are weird too .
neutral	i '_m tall and thin but my legs are oddly short and their jeans seem to flatten your butt , but are wide in the hips and tight in the calf area .
neutral	like no one '_s shaped like that .
neutral	and their infamous $_00 jeans .
neutral	not worth those $_00 .
neutral	then they sometimes misrepresent an item with the wrong picture and don_'_t respond to those emails sent on the site .
neutral	and i didn_'_t like how at first in store they only issued store credit but they changed that now thank_goodness .
neutral	i just wish their quality was better and that their jeans didn_'_t fit so oddly
neutral	well i '_ve only ordered once from them and ordered 0 things ( crop tops ) and i love the fact that there '_s no shipping .
neutral	i hate_paying for shipping but one of the tops were cheap ( like $ 0 ) and the quality was very poor but the other one was cheap too , cost more but still cheap and i love it , shipping time was good too though .
neutral	also they are expensive , a cute crop top was like almost $_00 .
neutral	i '_m giving it a 0 because i haven_'_t had much experience with the site and i guess it depends on what you buy , regarding quality , and the majority of the items are very expensive .
neutral	the card itself was very easy to purchase however its very confusing to use . i used this card to do an in app purchase . but to my dismay i couldn_'_t figure_out how to do so . i went threw every obvious sulotion i could think of and nothing , so i went to google to see what others were doing about the in app purchase . what i found was other people trying to do the same as me . so i know it would be benifical for the i tunes service to be more clear on how to do those kinds of transactions . never the less after surching a bit more a bell went off in my head about how i could possible do this action . i went my app and went to the bottom of the page and you know the rest i was able to make my purchase by adding the amount directly to my acct . im so happy i was able to do just what i wanted with my card . thank_you
neutral	i ordered belts and obviously they do no run true to size .
neutral	a large is like a small but i just want orders belts again .
neutral	see above .
neutral	most frustrating .
neutral	i sent out for two orders , my book and the cd '_s that go with the book .
neutral	my book arrived two_weeks_ago and i still have not received my second order , my cd '_s .
neutral	they are not trustworthy with getting your orders to you in a timely_manner even at all .
neutral	i booked a compact mercedes or the equivalent but wound_up with a ford_fiesta .
neutral	otherwise everything worked out well .
neutral	good pizza and food but cold on delivery
neutral	price has gone ridiculously high now the company is more established .
neutral	price before was really reasonable and close to prices one would pay if shopping in asia .
neutral	this business is awesome because they have a huge_selection of amazing and hard to find products .
neutral	the only problem i '_ve had with them is that if they ' re out of stock with a certain product they don_'_t tell you that until you '_ve already placed your order .
neutral	that '_s difficult when the free_shipping when you spend 000_dollars is void if they ' re out of stock .
neutral	i was really disappointed by that .
neutral	how hard is it to add an out of stock button ?
neutral	pet - flow is an easy way to buy a supply of dog_food , however , the automatic order procedure is not working for me .
neutral	they wanted to send another bag of dog_food way before i had room to store it in the dog_food bin , so i held off for several weeks , then all at once i had another 00_lb .
neutral	bag sitting on the porch .
neutral	it now sits in the garage unopened until there is room enough to store in bin .
neutral	i have one old ( 00_yr . old ) cocker_spaniel who is on a periennial diet , so he gets a cup a day .
neutral	afraid to get too much ahead of time .
neutral	we are living day to day .
neutral	ordering and delivery was easy and efficient .
neutral	returning goods was another kettle of fish .
neutral	i received goods damaged in transit and wanted a replacement but this could not be actioned until the damaged goods had been received back .
neutral	i couldn_'_t wait that long so sent all back for a refund and went somewhere_else !
neutral	also its worth_noting you can only return through collect_plus stores which is quite restricting .
neutral	i was given an order date for my purchase , but it did not arrive on the date given , no information from homebase as why this occured .
neutral	the item did arrive the following_day .
neutral	just be aware you may not get your purchase on the date expected even if like i did you paid for the postage .
neutral	we really like playing spike all with our family .
neutral	unfurtunately it was broke the first day the boys played a competitive match .
neutral	no the rim is misshaped , which is very upsetting for my son
neutral	we enjoyed the bustour , but since my son speaks hardly any english , we mostly toured on the blue line .
neutral	there via headsets you get very little information about london and what is there to see .
neutral	this was rather disappointing , on top 0 - 0 stops were not served because of a roadproblem .
neutral	the employees are nice but very businesslike , it is very obvious that they are there to sell tickets mainly .
neutral	more detailed_information via headwould be desirable !
neutral	i get notices that someone viewed by info but then i have to go into the website and look myself .
neutral	it '_s difficult to see what '_s going on .
neutral	it would be nicer if when we received the notice , it was more specific so that we knew right_away whether we should be checking it , that it '_s a serious breach , or if we can view it later .
neutral	all notice are the same level .
neutral	i want to know if someone is trying to open an account or has accessed by checking_account .
neutral	unfortunately we made a mistake with our original booking and rang rentalcars to extend by 00_hours but they did not process the extra day and we ended_up paying 00_euros to goldcar for an extra day - lesson_learned !
neutral	i would give this 0_stars and i have spent_thousands of dollars at this store in the past_year .
neutral	but when i made the decision to buy a spare set of lights " used " saving a couple_hundred_dollars , it was a great set of hensel lights but ..... the power cords they sent with the lights were 0feet long !
neutral	really bh ?
neutral	who plugs studio lights in 0 feet away ?
neutral	i found that to be a cheap thing for them to do probably because the set didnt have any cords so they were cheap cheap cheap and threw in a four foot cord .
neutral	i was too busy that day to contact bh and forgot after that .
neutral	but now since a light got knocked over due to its short cord ... now i am contacting them .
neutral	it is difficult to get the first person you speak to do do anything -- even in email .
neutral	just ask to speak to a supervisor .
neutral	one problem was that the top joining bracket was cracked and couldn_'_t be hassled waiting for a replacement .
neutral	they look ok but it '_s a little irritating after_spending all that money
neutral	let '_s start with the good .
neutral	excellent service , arrived on time and the steak is of very good quality .... now for the bad .
neutral	the steak arrives ' bulk packed '.
neutral	four large steaks in each sealed bag , meaning you have to open each bag and re - pack into freezer bags in singles or pairs for future use - very messy and time - consuming .
neutral	great for dinner parties but not if you are a single or a couple ..... this would put me off ordering again , which is a great shame .
neutral	i loved my plaque , but there were a few quirks .
neutral	it didn_'_t really stick well and it got bent really easily .
neutral	it was beautiful though and if you don_'_t bend it , i '_m sure that you will enjoy the product .
neutral	if there wasn_'_t such a high cost of sending merchandise back to nygard through the mail , i would order more .
neutral	because i am never sure how something will fit ( and that depends on so many things i . e .
neutral	fabric and what label is on it ), it makes the ordering online so iffy .
neutral	i have been a good customer of nygard on - line over the years and i will_continue but it would be so much_easier and less_expensive if returns were made easier .
neutral	i know i can return the items to a store but the closest is almost a 0 hr .
neutral	drive away .
neutral	i purchased a few items on line which i was pleased with most , unfortunately i few things didnt fit and had to be returned .
neutral	its a shame that this cant be easily done in store for a refund or that you offer a free returns_policy i had to spend nearly_£ 0 on return postage which will now make me less likely to purchase on line again .
neutral	i ordered my parts 0 days before my second order and have not received the first one .
neutral	quite frustrated .
neutral	wish someone could fix this .
neutral	book was delivered in a used 0 ring binder as color copied pages .
neutral	did not realize this was the case .
neutral	a few of the pages were water logged .
neutral	delivery was prompt .
neutral	book will work .
neutral	saved a ton of money so overall pleased .
neutral	the item didnt suit me so i had to return it . the picture was misleading
neutral	i absolutely_loved the frames !
neutral	they were perfect and so adorable !
neutral	they would '_ve gotten 0_stars , but the prescription wasn_'_t right in them .
neutral	the glasses i wear now are my correct prescription and these new ones were so different and i couldn_'_t wear them for more than a minute at a time .
neutral	i '_m going to have to bring them to my eye_doctor so i can be sure i get the right prescription put in them .
neutral	i ordered a t - shirt for my husband for his_birthday .
neutral	the graphics are excellent tho ' the size seems to run a little small and the quality of the material is less_than i expected .
neutral	it '_s thinner_than i ' d like and i '_m not sure how it will hold up over many washings .
neutral	i don_'_t plan to order any more .
neutral	i only wanted to order a diary refill for my existing organiser & still had to pay full delivery prices which made it a very expensive full cost .
neutral	however i still love the products which are beautiful quality .
neutral	needed to worm a litter of kittens , realised i had run_out so ordered .
neutral	order wasnt dispatched for a few_days .
neutral	too slow .
neutral	should be posted the day its ordered or the following_day at latest .
neutral	if needing something urgently would have to go elsewhere
neutral	i and my partner had text_messages and emails stating delivery time would be between 00 :_00am - 00 :_00pm . at 00 :_00pm i had phone_call from driver to say they had missed me out by mistake . they were in scarborough and had to have a break and would be with me at 0pmish . they did arrive just after 0pm . they were extremely apologetic and polite . however i work fulltime , am very busy with family commitments , and specifically paid_extra for a guaranteed delivery which did not happen .
neutral	yes it was the same day but not the stipulated time that were texted and emailed . therefore i would like to be reimbursed for the extra payment .
neutral	i used to book a lot with ebookers and when everything is fine that '_s great but when there '_s a problem , get ready for a lot of frustration .
neutral	so many hoops to jump_through to sort out something that was not my fault .
neutral	first time i put it down to bad_luck but when similar happened , i realized that it was the system that was wrong .
neutral	now i use different sites to make my bookings .
neutral	i used to love facebook but in the last_year or so they have been going downhill a lot in my estimation .
neutral	they seem to want to control everything we do and ignore what people want .
neutral	i understand it '_s a business and they need to make money but there is a balance that they fail to achieve .
neutral	over the last 0 years i liked a number of pages but now , i never see any of their feeds .
neutral	same applies to many of my genuine friends whose feeds seem to have vanished .
neutral	if i like a page , i want to see what they post but facebook decide what i see .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	now i find myself only checking in once or twice a week for a few_minutes instead of 0 or 0 times a day .
neutral	facebook is killing what made them great and now i can happily live without it .
neutral	adobe is very expensive but i still love their software .
neutral	but i am worried_about their online business now as i only use it occasionally and because i travel a lot , i don_'_t always have internet_connection .
neutral	maybe i have it wrong but i just can '_t see the online software model working for me .
neutral	i hope i '_m wrong .
neutral	the way it '_s organized is good and i like the content .
neutral	i have two main difficulties .
neutral	my default browser ( internet_explorer ) hardly lets me edit exercises i correct at all .
neutral	i have switched to using chrome for busuu , but that '_s not perfect either though it is better_than ie .
neutral	maybe firefox works better ?
neutral	the translations are british english ( i '_m american ) so sometimes it '_s hard to understand .
neutral	normally we are very happy with finding the products we specifically are looking for and shipping is very fast .
neutral	but , this time in looking for the fish_oil product we always purchase we could not find here in the qty bottle size we like .
neutral	i received the goods as ordered but it took several days & i received no email_confirming they ' d been sent .
neutral	shoes were great , too bad they didn_'_t fit and too expensive to return .
neutral	😩
neutral	the ring is beautiful itself however i feel it '_s cheaply_made i purchased the more_expensive one to avoid that issue
neutral	packaging damaged in transit , parts missing , poor instructions plus instructions included for parts not on the treadmill .
neutral	once assembled treadmill was ok although cannot alter tension belt as instructed as there isn_'_t one !!
neutral	adequate for my needs .
neutral	quick delivery , note of quantity but not actual bill , it did say invoice to follow but still not got one .
neutral	sent email , no reply . not impressed
neutral	my plants arrived .
neutral	they were smaller_than i expected .
neutral	i took them out and planted them .
neutral	i didn_'_t buy enough of them so i went to my local home improvement store and bought more of them that were larger than what i received and half the price .
neutral	needless to say i was not a happy_camper .
neutral	recieved item ( a day earlier_than_expected : p ) but unfortunately there was a crack in the casing of the machine .
neutral	called up immediately to report and was told to take pics and send to an e_mail address .
neutral	tried to do this but e_mail address did not exist .
neutral	tried to call back but couldnt seem to get an answer .
neutral	good machine .
neutral	just a bit dissapointed with after service .
neutral	hope to get it sorted :)
neutral	i wish hostelworld good offer better price .
neutral	after having travelled to phuket and bangkok and interacting with many tourist i found that there are better offers in the market than what hotelworld offers .
neutral	in order to stay competitve hostelworld needs to match the market price for budget travellers .
neutral	but .... when i pay for 0 day delivery and usps takes 0 days to deliver makes it not good service !!
neutral	ups of fed_ex would be better at delivery !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered some address labels on june_00th .
neutral	just got an_email yesterday ( july_00th ) that they probably_won_'_t arrive until the 00th .
neutral	did not realize it would take almost 0_weeks to get them .
neutral	i talked with john of 0 / 00 who offered me an_additional discount of $_00 if i signed_up for magazines .
neutral	i would receive a letter with the details and a $_00 debit_card within a week or two and then the magazines would start .
neutral	he also gave_me a number , after i had asked , to call to cancel if i had any_problems .
neutral	as of today , 0 / 00 , i have received nothing .
neutral	i called the number i was given and they have no record of me .
neutral	they gave_me numbers to other magazine sales companies .
neutral	they also had no record of me .
neutral	i was advised to call the publisher .
neutral	i did call one of the three publishers and they have no record of me .
neutral	have not yet received my credit_card bill to see if i was charged .
neutral	have spent way too much time following up on this .
neutral	i recieved the book in a timely_manner yet the book was disgusting and in bad quality .
neutral	it had mold growing and there are a bunch of waterstains .
neutral	i was aware that there was damage to the book although not that much damage .
neutral	maybe when sending out the books be sure that it is legible , and in decent shape .
neutral	website - easy to use / easy to choose / easy to buy
neutral	sales_team - one person hung_up on my husband , followed by 0 people over 0 days attempting to sell in extras - please get it drl after the first call , why would a customer be wanting to think 0 times about a brand_new_washing_machine breaking down when our last one lasted 00 years ??
neutral	poor experience
neutral	delivery - arrived 0 . 00am - was fitted before breakfast and love the machine
neutral	thanks
neutral	i '_ve ordered a virgin brazilian lace closure and some virgin brazilian hair from this site and i would have to stay that my experience was half and half .
neutral	the lace closure was beautiful but the knots would not bleach and the hair was just gorgeous but the supplier lightly died my hair after i asked them not to .
neutral	also , when i told the first supplier that the knots on my lace closure would not bleach ( after i confirmed the order ) i never_heard from them again .
neutral	so when buying on this website please check the following :
neutral	0 .
neutral	the customer rating .
neutral	if the customer rating is below an 00 , i highly advise you not to order from that seller .
neutral	also , read all of customer feedback .
neutral	the good and the bad .
neutral	0 .
neutral	bug the hell out of them .
neutral	if you have a question about the product , ask them .
neutral	0 .
neutral	do not release your money until you receive your product .
neutral	when you place your order , it gives you and option to confirm delivery .
neutral	do not click that option until you receive your product because once they have the money , then you will never hear from them .
neutral	i hope this helps
neutral	ik_heb nogal wat problemen ervaren met_de drukproeven .
neutral	deze worden gemaild en vervolgens gaan jullie zitten wachten op reactie , zelfs bij een spoedopdracht .
neutral	ik werk niet elke dag , dus drukproeven zie ik pas 0 dagen_later .
neutral	voor gewone opdrachten zou_het nog door de beugel kunnen .
neutral	maar voor spoedopdrachten kan dit echt niet .
neutral	my initial order was handled very promtly and arrived quickly - no problem there .
neutral	unfortunately the shoes were not suitable and needed to be returned .
neutral	the collect_+ service for returns is poor - it is advertised as allowing you to return at lots of local convenient stores at no cost .
neutral	i live in london and the nearest shop i could use to return goods was miles_away - nothing in any local centres .
neutral	this means i either have to pay for returning with a collection service or travel a long way , to shops which are not in local centres .
neutral	collect_+ needs to improve a lot for it to offer a convenient and acceptable level of service .
neutral	i shall look at other options before i buy again from barringtons .
neutral	apart_from the delivery cost issue i was extremely happy with my purchase .
neutral	however , the surcharged delivery is a major problem that will_definitely stop me shopping with you again , unfortunately .
neutral	the rest of the uk would have had next_day delivery free for my purchase ... i had to pay £_00 for delivery and then had to wait several days for it to be delivered ... not a comparible service at all .
neutral	sorry
neutral	amazon is a great place to find just about anything the only bad thing about the website is who your seller is and if they are legit .
neutral	i '_ve only , thankfully , had one bad_experience where i never received my product and the seller disappeared .
neutral	on the bright side , amazon came through and refunded my purchase .
neutral	other than that , if its fulfilled by amazon you ' re pretty_much insured .
neutral	great website to look for random trinkets .
neutral	it took 0 phone_calls to finally get the most efficient way to get my phone fixed .
neutral	the first person was foreign , hard to understand , and very unhelpful .
neutral	all he wanted was a copy of a receipt and kept telling_me the phone i had did not match the account , yet it was the same phone i purchased when i purchased squaretrade .
neutral	the second woman was very nice and tried to be helpful , but only offered me the option of drive an_hour and a half to get my phone fixed because they did not have my phone in stock .
neutral	so i told her i ' d wait .
neutral	finally , when i called back a third time , this woman offered me many options , that the others had not , including sending my phone away and replacing the screen at no cost .
neutral	so , i went head with that option .
neutral	the service was very quick for being across the country .
neutral	the fixed the screen and sent it back within 0 days .
neutral	i was very happy to get my phone back , until i realized they had reset my phone to factory settings , deleting all of my contacts , pictures , apps and notes .
neutral	they wiped my phone clear and i am still not sure why .
neutral	only the screen needed to be replaced .
neutral	needless to say , i was very upset when i found this out .
neutral	all in all , i think you get what you pay for .
neutral	this insurance is significantly_cheaper_than going through my service provider , however i think i now know why .
neutral	very happy to purchase an_alternative to the nespresso monopoly .
neutral	however , the packaging makes the capsules very bulky and the performance in my nespresso u machine was erratic .
neutral	sometimes the coff would flow slowly and other times it wouldn_'_t produce the correct quantity .
neutral	gave the capsules to a friend with an older machine and the same problems arose .
neutral	i wish you success in finding a formula that presents true competition .
neutral	i received my ink in a matter of days .
neutral	however , i had to clean the ink_cartridges in my printer several_times before they worked .
neutral	and they still have a line through them .
neutral	i '_ve cleaned my printer & gone_through all of the functions to align & set it up .
neutral	however , it seems to be a problem with the cartridge itself .
neutral	if using recycled ink_cartridges at home for random printing , it '_s not too bad .
neutral	but if this is for business or to print photos , you may want to consider buying a brand_new cartridge .
neutral	the screen i was sent had one pixel damaged .
neutral	i would like some_sort of credit or refund for screen_country sending me a screen that had a pixel damaged
neutral	as experienced divers we chose this product as a special birthday_present for a friend who has just taken up the sport .
neutral	it seemed to offer the best value for the most functions , has a clear face , easy to press buttons and is ideal for a novice diver .
neutral	however , when it arrived the box was rather ripped and battered and the computer was rolling round in the bottom of the box .
neutral	it had just been popped into a large jiffy_bag and had suffered the rigours of royal_mail .
neutral	of course this wouldn_'_t have mattered had it been for our personal use but i had to set about the box with sellotape , pritt stick and a blue felt pen to try to stop it looking like something i had picked_up at a car boot sale !
neutral	i bought a dress which was so cute but it didnt fit me .
neutral	i got my size and ith ouldnt fit my top half .
neutral	i was very disapointed
neutral	unfortunately the poor packaging meant that the goods turned_up damaged .
neutral	still usable , but not perfect .
neutral	as the damaged wouldn_'_t be seen i decided not to bother sending it back , but it was disappointing and could have been easily avoided .
neutral	plastic around the moses basked as very dirty so it looked like it had spent sometime in a dirty warehouse before being packed for shipping .
neutral	difficult to know if issue is with the retailer or the courier .
neutral	the blinds are good value for money , but it is a very much self service and can be difficult if you ' re not great at diy !
neutral	!
neutral	the visa_gift_card was not accepted in several places .
neutral	it '_s embarrassing to be denied when you try to use a card at a restaurant .
neutral	too many ' conditions ' surround the usage .
neutral	i would not purchase another of this type .
neutral	ordering the bathroom suit went well on saturday in the showroom till we got to the warehouse to find out the cistern for the toilet was in another warehouse that was closed , we found this frustrating but was advised to phone customer_services so we did on monday_morning and this sorted over the phone and delivered free the following_day , so in the end it was a good service , but when we were waiting in the warehouse one customer was kicking off because he had been waiting for an_hour dont blame him it was freezing_cold and he was stood looking at the item he wanted behind the yellow tape that he could not cross !
neutral	!
neutral	i have been using pet_flow for the last few_months and getting shipments from las_vegas .
neutral	my last shipment was shipped from new_jersey , making the arrival four days late .
neutral	i ran_out of food and had to purchase something equivalent at the local_pet_store and mix it with my remaining food to make it last .
neutral	i was very disappointed that the email that was sent to me saying the food was shipping next week would be coming from new_jersey to california .
neutral	if i had known , i would have called and had the food sent earlier .
neutral	i have ordered from pet_flow 0 times now .
neutral	they have good prices .
neutral	but at times the cans can be very dented and unusable .
neutral	i just ordered the 0_oz .
neutral	cans and they all were fine .
neutral	over the winter my ordered got delayed because of the weather but for some_reason fedex and ups both were able to get to my neighborhood just fine .
neutral	my order was delayed .
neutral	i was not happy at all .
neutral	you will get inundated with emails from pet_flow as well .
neutral	i will_continue to use pet_flow despite my experience only because we have moved and i no_longer live close to the pet_store i used .
neutral	only for convenience
neutral	i think i would purchase the t - shirt again but won_'_t know for sure until it is worn and washed a few more times .
neutral	i would not purchase the hat .
neutral	very cheap , ill fitting .
neutral	still_waiting for my part to arrive , 00 days today .
neutral	took me a few attempts to search for hotel / airfare packages .
neutral	checked my internet_connection and it was great .
neutral	after few attempts , i was able to book our nyc trip !!
neutral	yay !
neutral	!
neutral	my mom and i were visiting_london for the first time and were really looking_forward to seeing all the sights .
neutral	the ' hop - on , hop - off ' option for both the river_boat and buses that big_bus_tours provides seemed like an ideal option .
neutral	i booked our tickets online , but as we were tourists , i didn_'_t have a printer to print our confirmation .
neutral	i assumed that since i could book online and i got an_email with a confirmation code , that would be all i needed .
neutral	when we tried to board the river_boat near the london_eye , the associate in the office had no_idea what to do without a printed confirmation form and sent us across the river to another office that could deal with our reservation .
neutral	we trudged in the rain to the next office where we were told they couldn_'_t do anything for us and were directed to an internet cafe in the nearest tube station .
neutral	the internet cafe was closed and at this point , it was nearly 00 : 00 .
neutral	we decided to call it a day and i called big_bus_tours the next_day to get everything straightened_out .
neutral	i reached danielle in the big_bus_tours office who said that we could just go to the bus near waterloo station and she would work everything out with the tour_operator when we got there .
neutral	there was still a bit of confusion , but things did work out and danielle arranged it so we could still use both of the days we had paid for .
neutral	with the full - featured internet site that big_bus_tours has coupled with the fact that customers will likely be tourists who are without printers , it seems that making the process paperless should be a priority .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i '_m french so it '_s difficult for me to explain me in english ...
neutral	i '_m always waiting for my two perfums ... where are they ??
neutral	?
neutral	thank_you for your answer ( in french of course !)
neutral	as i live in / france i have found that the exchange_rate give n by medicanimal is far higher_than is available - 0 . 0 %!!.
neutral	although postage is free i shall not be ordering anything in future .
neutral	i can '_t fault the service though .
neutral	the first problem i encountered was that you advised a different size to the one i ordered .
neutral	one of your operators told me that you didn_'_t do towel radiators in the sizes indicated on your ebay website , she said it was an_error .
neutral	i subsequently went to your online site ( ibathuk ) and found that you had one 000x000
neutral	( rt00t ) which i then ordered ( no problem ).
neutral	when it was delivered it was halfway out of the carton .
neutral	fortunately it wasn_'_t damaged and has now been installed .
neutral	despite the above , i am pleased with it , and hopefully no one else will be sidetracked by your operators giving wrong information .
neutral	i was trying to order custom sized filters on the website and couldn_'_t do it .
neutral	i '_ve ordered them before without a problem .
neutral	the blue bar that normally slides back and forth to pick the size wasn_'_t working .
neutral	first , i tried to do the live_chat .
neutral	it said i was " 0 " in line , but , after over 0 minutes no one chatted with me .
neutral	therefore , i called to try to order them by phone .
neutral	i tried_calling several_times on thurs .
neutral	0 / 00 and kept getting a message_saying they were closed .
neutral	i called again on fri . 0 / 00 .
neutral	i was placed on hold for 00_minutes ( my phone has a timer ) before a rep got on the phone .
neutral	when i did get a rep , she was very helpful .
neutral	she told me that the size i needed ( 00x00x0 ) was actually a " standard " size not custom as i thought .
neutral	therefore , i got back on the website and ordered it .
neutral	ordering a " stock " item online was easy .
neutral	i haven_'_t received the order yet , but , hopefully it will be shipped in a timely_manner .
neutral	i did get a confirmation right_away indicating the order was being_processed .
neutral	past experiences with this company have been fantastic so hopefully the issues last_week are just a fluke .
neutral	don_'_t try and book anything on line - you cannot do it .
neutral	first it was a wildly incorrect amount ($ 0000 to travel from durham to rdu ), that was corrected and now it asks for information that it not on the form ( your email ) or has_been done ( accept terms ).
neutral	the tour was ok and the guides were knowledgeable but we spent hours riding around trying to get back to our pickup point .
neutral	apparently the drop_off point on baker st . is not very popular .
neutral	we actually rode throught the same stops twice before we got back to baker_street and some of the guides were no help .
neutral	your street guides need a little more training .
neutral	the service was good and helpful when you spoke to the guys at the bus_stop , when we asked the driver if she stopped at hamleys ' yes ' was the reply , we never got there , we went round buckingham_palace , and two parks , two and half times , i said to my cousin ( she_lives in london )' r we nearly there ' ' we should be ' she replyed we went round and round again .
neutral	i asked the the bus driver and the reply was ' no the tourer has ended ' we never got the children to hamleys , we where on a bus for an_hour or so .
neutral	we still enjoyed our day .
neutral	villa_plus were a good company to deal with .
neutral	they had a good range of villas and the booking process was very straightforward .
neutral	the website could be improved , it '_s a bit clucky and was basic .
neutral	our only issue was the villa , it was fine but just okay .
neutral	the kitchen was very basically stocked in terms of crockery , utensils etc and there wasn_'_t even ovenware or baking trays meaning cooking anything more simple than pasta was a challenge .
neutral	also the beds were horrendous , we ended_up sleeping on the sofa as they were so uncomfortable .
neutral	we '_ve used lots of villa companies before and not had an_issue with either of these things before .
neutral	this would put me off booking again with villa_plus .
neutral	enough said .
neutral	nice piece of furniture , well made , well chosen wood but as a serious readers book case not very good as there is insufficient room between the shelves to accommodate even quite small books upright and many books have to be stored flat . the shelf heights are not adjustable
neutral	good service .
neutral	when the sofa and loveseat was delivered , i found it was stapled together .
neutral	not impressive .
neutral	i don_'_t think it '_s going to last past a couple of years .
neutral	have to admit i was disappointed in the quality of the furniture .
neutral	we didn_'_t get what .
neutral	we œ ordered .
neutral	we ordered a non heated mirror , received a heated mirror .
neutral	obviously the connectors didn_'_t match .
neutral	we had no choice but to put it okn because the vehicle was going out of town .
neutral	my order has not yet arrived , last time i ordered it was very quick in getting here .
neutral	thats is why i ordered from you this time .
neutral	i have received your confirmation that you have sent it .
neutral	my boyfriend and i stayed at the amber inn and it took us almost a half_hour to get checked in .
neutral	they couldn_'_t find our room reservation when we got there so i had to go back to my car to get my phone so i could show the lady the confirmation_email .
neutral	i showed her , she had me fill_out some papers , and told me our room wasn_'_t ready so we had to wait 00_minutes .
neutral	there should have been better communication between bookit . com and the amber inn so we didn_'_t have to wait so long for our room .
neutral	arrived when expected , good courteous courier , and proved to be a quality bag with lovely soft_leather .
neutral	just what was wanted .
neutral	shame about the poor packaging , though - the box the bag came in arrived so badly_damaged that even the courier took a photo of it to show the damage was there on delivery .
neutral	i guess the cloth bag might have given the bag a tiny amount of protection but no bubble - wrap or polystyrene chips or other protective wrapping and a box ripped_open at the seams did not bode well even if the contents were later found to be undamaged .
neutral	more by luck than judgement , i suspect and hopefully the golden boot will rectify this for the future .
neutral	meantime , beware !
neutral	i phoned iflorist to ask about quality as there are no reviews on the website itself , and to be sure the flowers ( for my sister '_s funeral ) would contain the number of roses as shown in the image as all three sizes offered have exactly the same picture .
neutral	yet rather_than 0 roses and lisianthus ( a beautiful mixture of white and purples ), the spray provided was of two roses , carnations and irises - pretty enough , and of an acceptable quality , but not what i had ordered .
neutral	flowers for special_occasions have to be right first time - there is no second chance .
neutral	processes were all fine - but the delivering florists let this down .
neutral	i was lured to petflow by a really great sale ( 0 - cent for pig_ears & duck_sticks ).
neutral	but i was only allowed to be 0 of each .
neutral	okay that '_s fair enough .
neutral	i bought a bunch of stuff to get the free_shipping .
neutral	i do not pay for shipping .
neutral	long_story short - there are many items i want to buy on your site .
neutral	get_rid of the minimum for free_shipping and i will buy them .
neutral	otherwise - it '_s amazon for me .
neutral	i was happy with the prices at merlin and the amount of time the package took to get to me .
neutral	what i wasn_'_t happy with the the method of delivery .
neutral	you have personally sign for the package or it won_'_t be left at your door .
neutral	i found this to be excptionally inconvinient .
neutral	it would be fine to offer this service , but the choice should be yours .
neutral	if you have a day job , odds are you '_ll be speinding your time and gas to go to the post_office to pick it up .
neutral	in reply to merlin_cycles
neutral	in america you can ship a package and have it tracked without_having to sign for it at the time of deliver .
neutral	i recently ordered 0 butterfly bushes and they arrived in beautiful condition .
neutral	for my second order i ordered 0 citronella plants .
neutral	when they arrived they were in a box two times larger than necessary .
neutral	none of they plants were in the pots .
neutral	they were still in the plastic but flung around the box .
neutral	the leaves on 0 of them are all brown and i doubt they will grow .
neutral	i '_ve planted them and 0 look fine but the other 0 are all wilted and brown .
neutral	after the first order , i '_m really disappointed and not sure if i '_ll order from you again .
neutral	i have enjoyed ur products but i bought an indian meal which you advertised as tapas , two for £_00 .
neutral	unfortunately i got to the resteraunt and was told it was not tapas , but simply a meal and that wowcher had . mistakenly posted the wrong_address .
neutral	i was very dissapointed in this and emailed wowcher .
neutral	i got no reply which in my opinion was very poor customer_service .
neutral	this has made me much more cautioud when purchasing .
neutral	great offers , customer care very helpful !
neutral	but problems with deliveries taking very long or on 0 occasions not being delivered till a dispute was opened
neutral	i paid for the bouquet to be enlarged and to me this was not done .
neutral	the flowers themselves were lovely and so was the vase there was just not enough flowers for what i paid for .
neutral	we bought salmon and halibut from this company because it came highly rated by dr . andrew weil .
neutral	we knew the fish would arrive frozen and from past experience with frozen seafood , we knew the taste was often compromised .
neutral	but because of dr . weil '_s recommendation , we thought it was worth a try , that maybe some new technology had been developed to improve the flavor .
neutral	but alas , it is not so !
neutral	the fish was dry and tasted like cardboard .
neutral	we won_'_t be buying anything_else from this company .
neutral	i do love the fact that you guys sell just about everything !
neutral	all under 00_bucks .
neutral	i have ordered quite a few_times from you guys .
neutral	my book came in the week as_promised but my disappointment was when i opened the book and found the first page was double printed .
neutral	after a phone_call and given a voucher_code to reorder for free to get this put right .
neutral	much again disappointment when this did not work after several_attempts and more phone_calls .
neutral	i then started emailing ( gino ) and after many emails the only way the problem could be resolved was to reorder and pay again .
neutral	i agreed to this and was of course reimbursed , thankfully .
neutral	the book was received by my daughter at long last with great joy .
neutral	thanks
neutral	some of the food tastes quite awful , anything with minced beef for instance tastes dreadful .
neutral	it tastes very processed and unnatural .
neutral	when i placed my order , there was no_indication that the ostomy product i selected was backordered .
neutral	i was notified 0 days_later that the major item i ordered was backordered with no specific date that the item would be available .
neutral	the item actually did ship and arrived 00 days after i placed the order -- but in the meantime , i was very worried and ordered from another company so that i had stock available in case the order did not arrive for several weeks .
neutral	ostomy_supplies are like medicine -- they are necessary for life for people who depend upon them .
neutral	if they are not immediately available , the ordering system needs to let_me know .
neutral	i was very disappointing that i purchased a all_inclusive vacation but when we got to cancun we found that we had no transportation to our hotel so we had to pay another $_00 to get to our hotel and another $_00 to return to the airport .
neutral	the contact at our hotel was terrible and of zero help .
neutral	then we ended_up having to pay $_00 in luggage for our return trip .
neutral	i have never been on a all_inclusive that these things were not included .
neutral	i will be taking apple vacations from now on .
neutral	book our 0 night_stay , but when we arrived there was no copy of our pre_- paid reservation .
neutral	luckily the resort could accommodate us though we had to wait an_hour for them to find us a room .
neutral	resort took my credit_card info and told me if the reservation didn_'_t go thru by the end of my stay , we would be charged again for our room .
neutral	i don_'_t know what happened .
neutral	the mobility aid which was pictured as straight was delivered to my disabled friend folded in half , she was unable to straighten it , and unfortunately , she thought she would be unable to use the item , having explained this to customer_service , they saidt " that as it would probably be more costly to be returned than the value of th e value of the item motto worry " my money was returned the same day ., thank_you .
neutral	perhaps it would have been helpful to mention that the item would be delivered folded in half
neutral	i had an item sent to a friend thinking it would help her ,
neutral	unfortunately the item was delivered folded in half , having been displayed as straight .
neutral	my friend was unable to straighten it fully & unfortunately she decided it would not be of aid to her .
neutral	having spoken to customer_service they advised her not to send the item back as it '_s .
neutral	value was less_than the cost of returning .
neutral	my money was returned the same day , thank_you
neutral	but a warning could be printed advising that an item would not e sent out as shown
neutral	i purchased from moddeals a total of 0 times , the first time was a flawless and fast transaction .
neutral	i received my items super_fast and in perfect_condition .
neutral	so of course , i decided to order again when they were having a sale - i even considered doing a youtube haul video of their service and the items i bought from them .
neutral	the second time i bought a pair of flats and then two extra add on items since i was going to pay for shipping anyway ( the add on items were a pair of earrings and nail_polish ).
neutral	everything went fine and i paid via_paypal , when the package came i was surprised at how light it was and thought to myself " okay , maybe the flats are just really lightweight ?
neutral	"- wrong !
neutral	when i opened my package all i received were the two add on items , which made absolutely no sense to me .
neutral	i checked online to see if they had given me a refund since i thought maybe the item was out of stock and they would give me store credit or refund me without telling_me ?
neutral	that didn_'_t happen either .
neutral	i checked the invoice and the item was packaged in with the shipment .
neutral	unfortunately it wasn_'_t and i was left with two add on items and i was not willing to pay the flat_rate shipping for two items that cost less_than shipping itself .
neutral	i emailed moddeals about the issue and left them a message on facebook they called my house phone ( no email reply ) when i wasn_'_t home but i didn_'_t get a chance to call back since their hours of operation are inconvenient for my busy_schedule .
neutral	next_day , they directly refunded the cost of the shoes and shipping to my paypal .
neutral	i never received a reply via_email or facebook , nor did i receive an_apology or explanation .
neutral	so to wrap it up , i won_'_t be shopping with moddeals again , did they take_care of it ?
neutral	yes ... but i think they should have at_least apologized and told me what happened .
neutral	if it was a mistake and they let_me know it was a mistake , i would have been able to forgive them and continue to buy items from them .
neutral	to this day , i have no_idea what happened and received no apology .
neutral	i '_m now loyal to a similar online website that sells clothes at a much more discounted price and i '_m happy promoting them without_any compensation because they run a courteous business and actually care about their customers .
neutral	i won_'_t be saying anything nice about moddeals anytime_soon .
neutral	i need to return a faulty item and in all fairness gearzap have been helpful by telling_me to click on a link to view their returns_policy .
neutral	unfortunately the link does not open so at this present time i am unable to return the faulty goods .
neutral	first attempt to complete information did not go through .
neutral	billing stated $_00 and change told me to try again yet this time billing stated $_00 . 00 .
neutral	confused about why the difference ?
neutral	i have bought quite a number of wowchers and find the rewards of sharing to get a little something back in the form of wowcher credits really fab up until a few_weeks_ago when everything has_been tailored to hardly anything and sometimes now when i share or email an offer i do not receive wowcher credits even_though when i have done this in the past quite a few people have bought because of me sharing so just think its unfair that they have done this , i know i won_'_t be buying as many deals as i have been
neutral	it maybe a slight thing to complain_about but i find the wowcher credits a good idea and a slight compensation especially when a wowcher i buy has_been really bad ie_: the swan pan set absolutely_ridiculous buy they were didn_'_t last 0 minutes and when i bought a dinner set and 0 of the cups were broken on arrival
neutral	but other than this a fab service when you ring them although slow on replying to emails
neutral	i love all the clothes yesstyle has to offer ( so many cute ones !
neutral	), but i hate playing the waiting game when i unknowingly order something that isn_'_t technically in stock .
neutral	i '_ve seen " waiting in stock " in my account for weeks , and i know there '_s a possibility that my order will be cancelled ( this has happened to me before ).
neutral	this experience has killed my desire to order anything_else from yesstyle for a while , despite having my eye on a few items .
neutral	i don_'_t want to be entirely negative , though .
neutral	i made another order a few_months_ago that went_smoothly , and i was very happy with my purchase !
neutral	i won_'_t use priceline again .
neutral	all three of my latest stays were disappointing .
neutral	from check - in foul - ups to rude desk managers , to a lack of " truth in advertising ", to overpricing for what one received , to finding the same room for significantly_less after booking the " express deal "-- 00 - 00_%_off !"
neutral	at priceline , each trip was an exercise in frustration .
neutral	i tried the name your own price several_times and was never accepted unless i bid a lot more !
neutral	none of the places i went were worth the money i had to spend .
neutral	nope .
neutral	not again will i be_fooled .
neutral	unfortunately .
neutral	was very disappointed in item i ordered was far smaller_than we thought it would be .
neutral	no wall chart or exercise manual so unsure how or what to do with the straps to excerscise the arms or positions for feet and body on the plate
neutral	the service was fantastic , it arrived when it said it was going to and they emailed me to keep me updated with what was happening .
neutral	but the massage_table i bought i '_m not convinced about .
neutral	firstly it came with no instructions and although these things are self_explanatory it would be good just to check i was doing things right .
neutral	i '_m disappointed with the arm rest attachment as there is no reasonable place to put it and its not obvious where to put it , i am upset about that .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t of needed it so desperately i probably would have sent it back .
neutral	i had to go to the site three_times : 0 ) froze 0 ) had to enter info twice and still didn_'_t go through 0 ) finally worked .
neutral	fairly straight_forward transaction .
neutral	only issue was that we ordered mercedes or similar and ended_up with hyundai !
neutral	they didn_'_t have any mercedes for us to rent at the time of our arrival .
neutral	makes me wonder what the purpose of a reservation is ?
neutral	got the extra super cover insurance which was very good indeed to give us peace of mind .
neutral	we ended_up using the cover as we had some minor scrapes on the side of the car .
neutral	otherwise , besides from the type of car , transaction was smooth and easy .
neutral	ny order was dispatched very quickly however the quality of some of the furniture pieces did not reflect the price i paid ...... even_though the items were reduced due to a sale price .
neutral	the on - line booking is easy but when i rang cruise_republic they did not wish to help me and directed me back to the website .
neutral	one girl was helpful but others i spoke to did not wish to do anything and i felt they knew little about the boat .
neutral	first order arrived damaged and cracked , we paid £_00 for delivery for next_day , when i rang to say i needed a replacement i was told i had to wait two more days , after complaining they agree to deliver me one the next_day , no refund was offered to me for my next_day delivery charges and i also was told i had to dispose of their broken cistern , on the whole not a good service , i will not be buying from this co again .
neutral	i bought 0 swim vests for my grandchildren .
neutral	they came on time and were priced great , work great for flotation but the speedo logo on the back had wet paint and bled into the vest when used .
neutral	i initially thought communication was good as i received a couple of email regarding my order , 0 of which asked if they had the correct address for me or if i had an_alternative i ' d like to supply .
neutral	i supplied the alternative address immediately as i realised i wouldn_'_t be at home on the day of delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the item was shipped to the first address & not the alternative i had supplied ( as requested ).
neutral	i was not home & my neighbour was just leaving the house , she advised the delivery driver she could not take delivery of the item as she was in a rush .
neutral	the driver then signed for the item himself & left the package on my neighbours drive in heavy rain !
neutral	item arrived ok but packaging was so soaked through that it came apart when i picked it up !
neutral	overall item was good but customer_service was false as it seems messages were automatically generated but nobody attended to them & delivery company were poor !
neutral	selling my old_phones on this site seemed a doddle , and it was ... until they stated that my blackberry was faulty .
neutral	this was funny , since i checked it before i sent it and it worked_perfectly ?!
neutral	as it is they offer you less_than you would get elsewhere , even ebay , but seem disinclined to give you what it is worth .
neutral	i stuck with them for sake of ease anyway but won_'_t be using them next time .
neutral	it was only a small bunch flowers , i choose the big edition - so i was disappointed , i expected more value flower for this high price - asked the company in two mails and did not get an answer
neutral	this dress is very badly fitted .
neutral	having read_reviews i bought a size_bigger but the arms were ridiculously small while with no give in the fabric .
neutral	i had the sleeves altered .
neutral	i don_'_t like that the credit alerts don_'_t have the name of the bank or store and there is no phone_number i can call without calling identity_guard .
neutral	when i called identity_guard on sunday the only option was if i had a lost or stolen card or wallet so i hung_up and waited to call on monday .
neutral	i would like to talk to a human after hours .
neutral	i am going to look into another company .
neutral	actual shipping with the usps would have been $ 0 . 00 for two ounces .
neutral	i was charged $ 0 . 00 for shipping .
neutral	if the company charged for the actual shipping cost it wouldn_'_t have felt_like i got ripped_off .
neutral	i wanted to buy more than one without_any to : or from : you cant order generic cards
neutral	the flowers were beautiful , i was disappointed with the vase , and the florist sent a text the day before to tell her they would be delivered , i was hoping for a big surprise when they arrived ....... that was killed .
neutral	buyer caveat .
neutral	the company is ok .
neutral	i received the parts fairly quick .
neutral	however , i made the mistake of buying the wrong part , so whether it is their error or yours , you are hit with shipping_charges to send back as well as a 00_% re - stocking_fee for return of the part if the error is yours .
neutral	a phone_call would have saved me a lot .
neutral	bottom_line , shop around for the best deal and read the fine_print .
neutral	i was looking for underwater headphones .
neutral	after searching online this site came up and i thought i ' d give the a try .
neutral	their prices were good .
neutral	shipping normal .
neutral	i haven_'_t received them yet .
neutral	i '_m hoping all works out great so i could give them and excellent report .
neutral	i phoned up to renew policy as my payment_method was not being accepted for automatic_renewal .
neutral	communication from sales_rep was appalling .
neutral	i was treated as if it was my fault you were no_longer accepting laser payments .
neutral	this is the first time i have not been notified by vital_choice about shipping and i did not receive the full order .
neutral	easy to order and delivery guys were really helpful .
neutral	follow_up call starts off very friendly and we '_ll cover your items etc etc then the hard_sell on insurance cover and not happy when i refused to give bank_details and saying i did not want the cover , would use appliance direct again but would be ready for the follow_up call which does let them down .
neutral	very slow shipping .
neutral	no tracking_number
neutral	the company said they would email when out of stock items were available - but they did not .
neutral	i had to follow_up on my own to re order .
neutral	one item is still out of stock with no_explanation .
neutral	why can '_t they post something on the site or send an_email ?
neutral	also to redeem points or utilize a coupon , a separate order & shipment are required .
neutral	this is a nuisance for me & probably costs the company more than it should to process & ship !
neutral	i await your response .
neutral	adrienne nadler
neutral	well i have made few orders before and i had to return them .
neutral	firstly when i got the bag it was dirty and stained even_though it was in packaging !!!
neutral	so i returned it .
neutral	now i made a biiig order and gues what .... one of the dresses was stained again ... it felt and smelled like it came from werehouse where it got stained ...
neutral	i found few patches of brown wet staines ...
neutral	i just dont understand like why is this happening ...
neutral	i didnt even_bother returning it because thay was one dress that was better qualitythen the others that i ordered .
neutral	i washed it and yhen worn it .
neutral	i have to say that i am purely dissapointed ... and i think that i will now only ever buy cheap jewellery from you ... at_least it will be worth it .
neutral	i ordered a replacement_mirror for my car and was sent the wrong part . i '_m still_waiting for a return_authorization #. i mean i only ordered 0 part pretty hard 0 screw - up right ?
neutral	? anyway i guess you get what you pay for good prices but bad service ..
neutral	i purchased a voucher for £_00 . 00 (£ 00 . 00 usual price ) i also paid £ 0 . 00 for a deluxe bouquet .
neutral	although the recipient was pleased , i was disappointed with the size and amount of flowers - it looked like a £_00 . 00 bouquet !
neutral	i buy flowers from tesco and i just thought the discount made no difference at all .
neutral	confirmation texts were very good .
neutral	i was expecting my chair to be delivered on fri 00th_july .
neutral	it did not come and since the delivery slot ended at 0pm and the customer_service dept closed at 0pm there was no hope of doing anything about it .
neutral	i rang on saturday_morning but the couriers were not available until monday .
neutral	i received a phone_call at 0 . 00am on monday telling_me that it was out for delivery that day , but again , a time_slot of between_0am and 0pm .
neutral	so i had to wait in another day as it did not arrive until 0pm .
neutral	i do not understand_why the driver could not have notified me that he was unable to fulfil his delivery .
neutral	he apparently had my telephone_number .
neutral	as for the chair itself , my daughter and i managed to put it together with no difficulty and i am very pleased with it .
neutral	something needs to be done about the lack of communication between couriers and first furniture and their suppliers .
neutral	we received our garden furniture which is great but the delivery was a little frustrating as you get no flexibility at all on times and dates .
neutral	this was my first time using stressfree_parking and i have to say first_impressions were very disappointing .
neutral	i called the allotted 00_minutes ahead of time and was told my driver would be waiting .
neutral	he wasn_'_t .
neutral	i tried_calling the number specified , it was not answered and i was left circling gatwick passenger drop_off for 00_minutes .
neutral	eventually the driver appeared and was very apologetic saying he had been dropped_off at the south terminal , even_though the booking stated this was for the north_terminal .
neutral	i am very pleased to report that the return pick_up was much smoother so i can only assume this was a one of blip and i will try this again because i have heard very positive things from friends and family .
neutral	have ordered a few_times ... last one was frustrating as needed the items in a timely_fashion
neutral	after many phone_calls found out over one week_later items had not even been shipped out .
neutral	i had to call the vendor to find out what was going on and get the situation resolved which was rather strange .... as that is main_faucet '_s job to deal with thier vendors not mine .
neutral	also ended_up cancelling the other part of the order as that vendor was not shipping out for several weeks and needed the items for an inspection .
neutral	also need to get some screws missing from a previous order .
neutral	i was thrilled to find hombz and see the great price for the keurig coffee system .
neutral	i began to place an order and had trouble with the website .
neutral	in error , i placed two orders and immediately sent a message that i had done so .
neutral	i was told the second one would be cancelled .
neutral	i have since received a confirmation of shipment for two pots .
neutral	i have emailed the site a number of times to be sure that one was cancelled as_promised .
neutral	they have not responded .
neutral	while their prices are great , their communication is not .
neutral	i have also called twice and never received a call back .
neutral	i would like to do further business with them , however , i am concerned_about the fact that they are difficult to communicate with .
neutral	when checking into the hotel the clerk asked for my driver '_s license and my credit_card .
neutral	very normal process .
neutral	however , my ears heard a click clack as the clerk made an image of my credit_card onto a sheet of paper she then asked me to sign .
neutral	i asked where this paper would be stored , she indicated a file folder just behind her at the counter .
neutral	this folder was in clear access to all clerks with a copy machine just behind them if they were inclined to take the credit_card information .
neutral	the manager said they kept the document on file for at_least six_months !!!!!
neutral	i work with pos credit_cards and based on what i know - they are not in compliance with acceptable processes .
neutral	they need to get more modernized to enable them to swipe the card for electronic storage ( like that is 000_% safe anymore !).
neutral	i will now have to watch my credit_card statement forever !
neutral	the manager was worried that she would need the information if in case someone stole towels ( some of which were ragged ), bed linens ( really !
neutral	), or other room items .
neutral	made me wonder about her clientel .
neutral	dispite my above concern - our overall stay was comfortable , the room was clean , staff was helpful .
neutral	they could use a new set of fresh towels and purge the ragged ones !
neutral	prompt delivery .
neutral	both packages of the 0 lb .
neutral	royal_canin special 00 arrived in good shape .
neutral	only one thing concerned me on the expiration_date ... 0 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	only 0 . 0 months shelf_life .
neutral	this is far shorter_than products at other pet_stores .
neutral	maybe this is why they were on sale .
neutral	if petflow can offer longer ( one - year ) expiration_dates , this plan will be more attractive .
neutral	i received a confirmation_email and was told i would receive a shipping email , but didn_'_t .
neutral	when i sent an_email inquiring_about a tracking_# for $_000 worth of gift_cards , i received no reply .
neutral	not the internet shopping_experience i '_m used to .
neutral	i sent a book in that i was selling which i had paid around $_000 . 00 and they decide not purchase the book due to the books condition .
neutral	so instead of offering to send back to me ( at my cost ) they destroyed the book because it was soiled and / or stained .
neutral	not very happy could have donated it to my sons school .
neutral	i was highly disappointed in the hotel experience and would not recommend the tropicana to anyone .
neutral	checked into a dirty room , never had enough people on staff to have a short wait to ask a question to get assistance , the concierge was unhelpful , etc .
neutral	the maids didn_'_t follow the leaving the towels on the floor means to change it and hanging up leave it alone .
neutral	there was no consistency from day to day .
neutral	never got to try out the pool as it got closed due to strong winds .
neutral	the flight was good and the purchase on the site went_smoothly .
neutral	experience was good , very easy to get a quote but experiences very slow payment after promptly sending off my goods .
neutral	i expected to have the order delivered by now ... but so_far it hasn_'_t been so i am giving a so so rating since i have to rate it before i can submit this .
neutral	the best thing i ordered was the massaging shower strap .
neutral	i liked it so much that i had my brother that was visiting try it and he wanted one to .
neutral	he took my catalog home to place an order on a few things he liked my husband is using the wound honey on a problem area he has .
neutral	i had 0 lamps that were hard to turn on and are much_better with the lamp switch turners .
neutral	the toast tongs are very handy .
neutral	the items purchased were as_described .
neutral	shipping was slow and packaging was horrible .
neutral	i have two storage_units that i rent .
neutral	i found out last_week that one was going up to 00 . 00 .
neutral	i just got the unit last october .
neutral	why is it going up already ?
neutral	if i had not called to ask another question about the unit , i would not have known the price was going up .
neutral	i did not receive a notice or anything .
neutral	this is not good business_practice .
neutral	we got our hotel , i guess it will be ok , we were supposed to get transfers car , boat , and taxi to the hotel villa defines , i paid $_000 , per person , which i now realize is $_00 too much .
neutral	on top of that , i don_'_t have any confirmation to show bd travel when i get there .
neutral	joni
neutral	it is very discourging when i place an order and an item is out of stock or no_longer available .
neutral	these items should no be on your web_site or state out of stock .
neutral	the order i just received i had to call because i did not get my entire order due to out of stock or discontinued items .
neutral	i was never notified prior yo shipment and i really wanted these items .
neutral	your customer_service needs to improve .
neutral	the hotel provides a simple & comfortable one bed_dorm .
neutral	room is clean & nice with the necessary basic needs .
neutral	it is a convenient location for me to take my tour the next_day .
neutral	toilets were also clean & maintained .
neutral	the items i received were of ok quality for what they were .
neutral	however , they did not fit my children .
neutral	when i went to return them , the restocking fees are outrageous !!!
neutral	i have blocked the site so i don_'_t accidently order from them again .
neutral	i value all of my internet stores , this one however will not be getting anymore of my business .
neutral	i absolutely_adore the clothes and shoes .
neutral	they are so fun and beautiful .
neutral	however , the service can be better .
neutral	shipping takes too long ; what i mean by that is that there are times where i '_ve waited 0_weeks with complaint .
neutral	if i '_m paying $_00 -$_00 in standard shipping , i ' d like to receive my products within 0 business days .
neutral	also , amiclubwear should deliver the correct sizes .
neutral	not to mention , they should list model measurements for more accurate sizes .
neutral	i ' d hate to purchase a small and it fits like a large , or purchase a large and it fits like a small .
neutral	sometimes , the shoe_sizes either run too large or too small and it '_s not noted on the site .
neutral	better service and measurements would be nice .
neutral	i was shocked that travelocity charged me more for having them save my information and frequent_flyer numbers .
neutral	i looked up the ticket and then decided to create an account so i could purchase the ticket .
neutral	once everything was finished , it was $_000 more than when i saw the ticket 00_minutes earlier .
neutral	i went back in to find a ticket again and the price went down .
neutral	i don_'_t know why they charge extra when they save your information .
neutral	then when i went to print off the boarding_passes for the flight home , it only let_me print the first boarding_pass and not the connection pass .
neutral	i think i will go through the airlines directly next time .
neutral	the wedge cushion is just what i needed for playing the viola on a plastic seat at rehearsal - thank_you !
neutral	the neck rest does not really do the job for making my stiff neck more comfy on a plane .
neutral	i sit in the aisle as i have long legs and would have preferred it to be symmetrical .
neutral	i think this would be ok for leaning against the window but it is not good for sitting in the aisle .
neutral	delivery excellent and quick .
neutral	just signed_up hope they help me
neutral	the prices really are fantastic compared to a lot of the other_places i looked for similar products .
neutral	i was really disappointed when i received all my items jam packed into a small box and saw how cheap they all looked but i guess you really do get what you pay for .
neutral	when we got to the holiday_inn we found out one of the restaurants was closed no stocked bar no room service and even_though we were all_inclusive you still had to pay for most things .
neutral	the bar didn_'_t open till 00 and closed at 00 !
neutral	i had paid for my entire trip in advance and without asking they put a hold of 000 on my credit_card which still has not been released !
neutral	every time we walked by the front_desk they were arguing with guests !
neutral	overall the deliver of item and quality of item are fine with a few notes of disappointment .
neutral	i don_'_t know who designed the hat but for a woman the " one size fits all concept was pretty riduculous and the hat was enormous .
neutral	it fit my foot ball player boyfriends head perfectly .
neutral	i '_ll need to wear a large hair clip to get it hold on my head properly .
neutral	the costume belt isn_'_t really a belt .
neutral	i couldn_'_t help but notice how the model '_s hand is strategically placed to hold the belt in place in the picture .
neutral	there is no prong or loop and i don_'_t plan to walk around the party with my hand on my waist to keep it in place so i '_ll need to find a real belt to complete the look or not .
neutral	so the included belt is pretty useless .
neutral	there is not enough friction in the belt fabric to keep it in place .
neutral	the ribbon tie is also pretty long so there is the option to trim it if needed to shorten it up on the corset style top .
neutral	i was somewhat disappointed in the purchase of the snugg for my new google nexus 0 .
neutral	i was expecting it to have more than two stand positions so you adjust the angle based on what you were doing .
neutral	the case does fit nice and snugg around the device and the velcro to hold it in the case is a nice feature .
neutral	now , as far as service goes , when i ordered the snugg , i understood that it was a pre_- order , but the website stated that it would be shipped on january 00 , 0000 .
neutral	mine wasn_'_t shipped until january 00st .
neutral	i also expected to receive confirmation that the product had shipped along with a tracking_number so that i could track the package and know when to expect it .
neutral	it took me three emails to finally get the information that i requested in the first email .
neutral	customer_service kept sending me confirmation of my order and not the tracking_information that i requested .
neutral	i now have my snugg and look_forward to at_least the protection it will offer to my google nexus 0 .
neutral	my biggest recommendation for the company would be , be careful what information you give out as far as shipping dates and also make_sure your customer_service representatives respond to the questions they are being asked in emails .
neutral	something you might want to consider adding to your website is an order tracking option so people like me can track their orders online without_having to send numerous_emails to get the information .
neutral	called today to explain_why i am less_than 000_percent satisfied and now i am even less satisfied .
neutral	why should i be inconvenienced with taking photographs because of your poor quality .
neutral	the only_reason i gave 0_stars is because i have only used my product once and it hasn_'_t turned_out like i have read on the site .
neutral	there has_been no friction , so i think the wording of the stars might be a little off .
neutral	i purchased the thunder_shirt as i have a dog that is terrified of storms .
neutral	she constantly paces , pants , scratches and searches for places to hide with no luck .
neutral	we '_ve only had the one storm and she was really good with letting_me put it on her , but it just didn_'_t work for her like i was hoping .
neutral	but , i am not giving up yet .
neutral	i will_continue to put this on her when we have storms and hopefully after a few_times it will begin to work for her .
neutral	gosh i '_m hoping because she can drive you crazy !!!!
neutral	i received my purchase very quickly and it looks just like the picture so i '_m pleased with that .
neutral	now if it will only work .
neutral	i '_m keeping my fingers_crossed .
neutral	my order arrived before it was due , great !
neutral	i ordered a set of four cartridges of an epson workforce pinter .
neutral	i am replacing them as needed , the cyan and magenta worked great , the yellow failed , the printer rejected it .
neutral	i haven_'_t tried the black yet .
neutral	these cartridges were " own brand ", you didn_'_t offer epson brand in the xl size .
neutral	i bought 0 dresses .
neutral	i usually wear a medium_size , so i ordered one in a medium , but then the second one made me nervous that it might be too short so i ordered a large .
neutral	the large ended_up fitting perfectly and the medium was so small i couldn_'_t even get the dress on my body !
neutral	can '_t wear it :(
neutral	usually when renting a book its used gently .
neutral	i was shocked when i got by book and it was taped together and missing the cover .
neutral	long shipping times and some bad quality items .
neutral	my total order was $_00 and its costing $_00 to ship .
neutral	my trainer referred me to your site and i needed the bands right_away .
neutral	when i need to purchase again , i will try to shop around for a more reasonable shipping charge .
neutral	i love the products but hate the prices .
neutral	i order them as a treat , for me and for christmas_gifts .
neutral	shipment arrived yesterday and many of the items were damaged .
neutral	i couldn_'_t be_happier with the product , seriously , but the time between ordering and receiving the product was much too long , and makes me afraid to order from you again .
neutral	i love the hundreds of designs to choose from .
neutral	when buying a dozen cards at a time for christmas ( nieces and nephews ), it '_s important to me to give each person a card that is different from the others and one that matches their personality .
neutral	however , after selecting a card and adding it to the cart , i had to start my search all over again from page 0 and there were 00 or so pages of christmas designs .
neutral	needless to say , i was very frustrated !
neutral	if you want to order one card or a bunch of the same card , the site would be ok .
neutral	but when buying a lot of cards with different designs , it '_s very time_consuming and frustrating to remember which page you left off on .
neutral	you also cannot navigate to the last page you were on , you have to start from the beginning and advance page by page .
neutral	even_though i was frustrated and it took me much longer to place my order , i am happy with the extensive design selection , the personalization and the quickness of receiving my order .
neutral	if they can change the site to make it more user_friendly by allowing me to " continue shopping " and take me back to the last page viewed or allow me to select a page from a drop down menu , then i ' d be 000_% satisfied !
neutral	lovely net_curtain but it cost me more to get it delivered and i had to sign for a curtain that was only worth a few_pounds
neutral	when i trcieved my order i was really excited .
neutral	the jeans i ordered was perfect .
neutral	i loved them .
neutral	the tops i ordered and the leggins i ordered eran small so i am having to return them .
neutral	i wish the tops came in a larger side so i can wear them .
neutral	the tops were a little thin i thought so you would have to wear a top under them .
neutral	ordered sunday_evening for a night out the following friday , thinking there was plenty of time for delivery .
neutral	it came at 0 . 00pm friday .
neutral	i was starting to get panicky as had nothing else to wear and had waited in all day on the friday aswell .
neutral	wasn_'_t happy .
neutral	won_'_t be using again
neutral	some of the games are really good .
neutral	i wish they would offer a ad free paid version but not a monthly one , just one off payments .
neutral	the ads seem to glitch up the games , , margrave manor won_'_t load for me now and i have uninstalled and reinstalled it knows who i am and has saved all my game play the main game just wont load .
neutral	i am playing the chronicals of albian now its very good but the ads definately glitch it up , they always seem to coincide with the puzzles and once the ads start you lose the puzzle and therefore the bonus money and frankly you need it to do that place up .
neutral	otherwise tip_top .
neutral	particularly enjoyed the sherlock holmes one .
neutral	my nespresso_machine has gotten harder and harder to use .
neutral	i am afraid i have ruined it by using fine_coffee club capsules that don_'_t quite fit .
neutral	i should have known better .
neutral	the money i saved on the coffee at fine_coffee club won_'_t pay for my new nespresso_machine .
neutral	i was penny wise and pound foolish on this one .
neutral	jag ser att mitt visa - kort har belastats med 000_kr den 00 juli .
neutral	vad är det ?
neutral	vid bokningen framgick att ingen avgift för kortbetalning skulle tas ut .
neutral	vad gäller de 000_kr för tjänst ?
neutral	tacksam för svar till min e_- mail : carin . thysell @ telia . com
neutral	har inte sett att själva flygresan belastat mitt konto .
neutral	är allt ok med bokningen ?
neutral	mvh karintysell
neutral	the product , a fabric cot organiser , was fine , very good price compared to other online_retailers for the same brand .
neutral	however , this saving was somewhat marred by the expensive p_& p rate to northern_ireland .
neutral	i thought that it would at_least arrive quickly but despite the postage which would have been sufficient to pay for 0 - 0 days delivery , the item took 0 days to arrive .
neutral	very disappointing since other online_retailers are able to provide free and speedy_delivery to ni e . g .
neutral	amazon .
neutral	my only_complaint about this experience was the long wait to recieve the car .
neutral	we stood in line , with only 0 people working the front_desk for over an_hour to recieve our car .
neutral	i didn_'_t think it would be so long considering we reserved the car a head of time .
neutral	also the woman at the front_desk was not very friendly or helpful .
neutral	once we were finished with her our experience was much_better .
neutral	the car was great , and driving it was a breeze .
neutral	love the sight but exchance to euro was far to expensive spent £_00 and was charged €_00_euro not impressed rate was €_00 wish i could pay in sterling then it would be great value
neutral	last time i order 0 or 0 items i dont remember well , but only end up getting 0 of them because after i order you guys run_out of inventory .
neutral	its not fair , you stayed with the money which i just used , but it was disappointing to order so many items to end up with only 0 :(.
neutral	i hope this time i can get everything i ordered and as soon as possible , my dad is coming to cr in 00 days , if my things don_'_t arrive on the estimated_date i won_'_t get my stuff :(
neutral	hello .
neutral	when i ordered the new panel i sent a email_saying that we had not had the other one that long only from dec 0000 .
neutral	i got a email back from raymond and he told me to take a photo and email to him .
neutral	since then raymond as sent me a couple of emails since but the way he had worded it is seemed to be very rude of him . so we are not happy because of him .
neutral	plus we ordered ivory 000 cover and we got the old one which just has triton on the front but it does not matter it fits and works .
neutral	i think that some staff need customer care training i could give this firm a bad name because of him but i will wait to hear from him as i sent him the old cover so he could see it for himself
neutral	took out insurance with d / away when i booked car as per usual
neutral	then was urged at europcar dept at coolangatta to take out cover with them as well
neutral	because it was an early start we were tired - had no access to emails with us and i could not check whether i had indeed taken out insurance prior ..( not sure why anyone would not ) i merrily accepted insurance with eurpcar !!
neutral	!
neutral	got to my accommodation and thought to clal d / a who said ofcours eu took insurance with us !!
neutral	it was ending up being another $_000 , of which i had already paid $_000 to d / away .
neutral	so started calling europecar branch to tell them the story and i needed refunding - they wanted me to drive back to coolangatta from byron bay as it was a legal document id signed
neutral	basically to cut a long_story short - got them to fax it all and did it hat way but not before a big fuss was made , manger involved etc !!
neutral	think driveaway need to know that europcar are asking customers to take insurance over and above the d / a insurance they '_ve already taken out !!!
neutral	bit of bad practice !
neutral	!
neutral	delivery was prompter than i expected , which was great .
neutral	but the website told me i ' d be receiving a free ole henriksen micro peel with my order - this never materialised which was disappointing .
neutral	you are very prompt , but after you cancelled one of my orders i found out this morning you just sent it .
neutral	last night after realizing the order for christ
neutral	mas were not going to make it in time i placed another order .
neutral	also , when you call trying to confirm a order a person doesn_'_t always have a pen in hand to get the info needed to verify the order .
neutral	i '_m sure i got at_least 0 call to verify .
neutral	after a while i wasn_'_t sure what i was verifying .
neutral	i was actually happy when you said you had cancelled the order .
neutral	there should be another way to handle a situation like this .
neutral	now what do i do with christmas visa_cards after christmas ?
neutral	for four days i tried to buy a gift_card and the website was clearly not working .
neutral	it took three phone_calls to finally find a person that was willing to go that one step further and really help .
neutral	then i had to spend time online and on the phone with two it people while they tried to help me figure_out the problem .
neutral	in the end i gave my credit_card information verbally on the phone and ordered the card that way .
neutral	by now it was less_than a week away from christmas so i had to pay for overnight shipping but was told this would be credited_back to me after the sale when through .
neutral	i still don_'_t know if that happened as i haven_'_t looked at my bank_statement but i did get the gift_card in time .
neutral	will tell hearing friends can phone rentify if they need look for rents .
neutral	the merchandi was awesome ; however , we were told the turn_around time between ordering and receiving our merchandise was 00 days .
neutral	it was 00 days before it shipped and another several days before it arrived .
neutral	slightly disapointed with some of the photos because heads etc were cut of which made the photos look a bit odd .
neutral	so i thought i had the perfect way to order my pet '_s food with petflow -- i loved the fact that i could get my prescription food from them , and if i ordered more than $_00 then shipping was free ( which i usually order at_least greater than $_00 at a time ).
neutral	well , the first shipment went fantastic , but when it came time for the second , they said they had problems with royal_canin not having the food available ( which i called royal_canin and they said there was plenty of it available , and what petflow was telling_me was untrue ).
neutral	so they said they were going to cancel my automatic_shipment .
neutral	so i had to call my vet and have them special order the food ( my vet doesn_'_t carry the one the cat needs to be on ), which they did .
neutral	so i bought the food at the vet , and then not 0 or 0 days_later , what shows up at my door ?
neutral	the food i ordered from petflow .
neutral	so now i have four bags of cat_food as_opposed to 0 .
neutral	it remains to be seen whether they are actually going to cancel future orders , or if there was just a huge mix up .
neutral	but very annoying situation .
neutral	no problem with ordering but shipping through fedex needs to change .
neutral	we live in arkansas the shipment tracked frm california to memphis , tn to mississippi and then back to arkansas - it took 0 days - way too long .
neutral	my box was left by my front_door .
neutral	never a problem with that .
neutral	however , the dog_treats inside were wrapped in their original wrapping , which had holes in them .
neutral	when i opened the box inside , millions of ants came out of the box , running all over my kitchen counter .
neutral	i would suggest placing dog snacks inside a zip - lock bag so this doesn_'_t happen .
neutral	i had also purchased a rug which was covered in ants .
neutral	it was a nightmare , really .
neutral	i cannot think that it was my computer , but i could not get through with my purchase from homebase on line , it kept jamming up .
neutral	eventually i made the order via my kindle .
neutral	clothes are good and prices but put off with delivery and time it took to find out the problem and where my order was .
neutral	inventory not precise ; notified book was sold out after it was purchased .
neutral	i trusted you .
neutral	great new range of products thought they were available - ordered and then you could only deliver one of the items i ordered - you offered an_alternative but it wasn_'_t what i wanted .
neutral	went to one of your competitors who could supply both new products cheaper_than yours - at the end of it just a bit disappointed as i couldnt cancel with you and i could buy one item from them .
neutral	will look hard before using you again - wish you could put it right !
neutral	paid for a gift_card but never received it so i called and was told i called too late ( still technically open , called 00_min before closing ) finally got my gift_card but the promotion had ended so i called back again and still wouldn_'_t honor the promotion .
neutral	not impresses with their customer_service !
neutral	i wish the app had more flexibility to filter for specific features and addressess .
neutral	i ordered 0 sacks ( 00_lb .
neutral	bags ) of dog_food .
neutral	the shipment came in two boxes - one sack in its own box and two sacks in another box .
neutral	the box with one sack inside was delivered in fine shape .
neutral	the box that held the two sacks was totally opened but the product was in good shape since " taste of the wild " dry_dog_food is packaged in such durable bags .
neutral	i will order from petflow . com .
neutral	ordered the jacket saturday before_xmas_eve and didn_'_t expect
neutral	to receive it before_xmas but , received it 0 working days_later .
neutral	only problem was the courier company .
neutral	parcel was attempted delivery to my work address and was undelivered because there was no one to sign for the parcel ?
neutral	tried to contact the courier company which was all automated and was quite frustrated at not being_able to speak to someone .
neutral	anyway , i arrange redelivery on the automated_system for the next_day .
neutral	parcel was delivered next_day .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	usually happy with the parts and price when i order but always hesitant until it all comes in the mail .
neutral	reading customer reviews makes most people nervous because of their return_policies ( suck )!
neutral	from what i '_ve read of customer reviews , as long as they get the order correct , all '_s good , but if they get it wrong , the customer suffers costs and major time delays / phone hassle '_s because of their " no fault " policies .
neutral	it seems , even when they ( partsgeek ) screw up , the customer is in for loss of funds and hell getting partsgeek to rectify the order .
neutral	horrible customer_service from what i '_ve read of customer reviews makes me think_twice before placing my order with them or getting elsewhere !
neutral	i was disatisfied with the response to my question as to why i did not get the 00_%_discount advertised for new on going orders . i have a standing order for 0 dog and was initating a new standing delivery for a new dog and a different food and they declined to discount my inital order . i then cancelled this new dog '_s standing delivery . they seemed unconcerned with the loss of this order .
neutral	i ordered stuff last_week , money went out , not had goods yet , hopefully tomorrow .
neutral	they did try and give me a free gift to say sorry .
neutral	i wait patiently !
neutral	check in was smooth and front_desk staff very pleasant and helpful .
neutral	room just didn_'_t feel clean .
neutral	also a little stuffy .
neutral	road_noise from the interstate was manageable with the window closed , but super loud with the window opened even a little_bit .
neutral	the worst part was the paper thin walls .
neutral	my neighbor on one side decided to watch a movie at 00 :_00am ... i think it was an " adult " film .
neutral	woke me out of a sound sleep .
neutral	the next night i got to hear the guy on the other side making a real_estate deal ... for 0 hours .
neutral	the hotels in deerfield fill quickly , so make your reservations in advance and avoid this hotel .
neutral	well i had my whole tripped booked and then it would not confirm .
neutral	i called the 000 number and said i would be helped .
neutral	after resisting starting from the beginning and letting her do it over the phone , i gave in and t ended_up costing me $_000 more for the same trip because the airline prices went up ( after over an_hour on the phone ).
neutral	i ended_up canceling trip and booking another later on .
neutral	as the item is a gift i have just seen it in the wrapping but it looks okay .
neutral	however , the packaging was awful .
neutral	it came in a g star box that would have been nice to give the t shirt in .
neutral	there was no extra wrapping just the box which had been torn and ripped back on the corner exposing the tissue_paper inside .
neutral	at first i thought the shirt had been removed but it was still there and luckily okay .
neutral	i feel that g star should take more trouble with their packaging or have a word with their couriers as i was disappointed to receive this broken and ripped box .
neutral	commentators were nice and got to see most of london '_s landmarks .
neutral	but in the blue line the recorded commentry wasn_'_t working .
neutral	good selection of products , however delivery took_ages .
neutral	was very had to contact amazon , but overall not a bad_experience .
neutral	will be buying from ebay again in the future .
neutral	the website was easy to maneuver however the wait time to recieve the product is a bit long and the return_policy is for only product that is returned unopened .
neutral	they don_'_t seem to have anything such as a 00 day replacement policy if broken within that time .
neutral	and that lack makes it a bit risky to buy since the necklaces can be a bit pricy depending_on your budget .
neutral	i ordered a gasket set the price was good but just dissappointed that one of the gaskets were the wrong one .
neutral	took_awhile to get the parts as well .
neutral	i ordered blue_buffalo dog_food from petbest . com because that website had the lowest_price and because the shipping was free .
neutral	however , i had to sign_up for delivery every so many weeks and what i don_'_t know is what the price will be when the next bag arrives .
neutral	the jury is still out on whether this was a good deal or not .
neutral	also , the dog_food took a long time to arrive , over a week with no updates and i went out and purchased a small bag to fill in until the 00_pound_bag arrived .
neutral	now , i know what to expect in terms of timing , but the real proof will be on the second and third deliveries and the billing ..
neutral	fast shipping , but book has extensive water_damage that was not stated in the description of the book .
neutral	oldies .
neutral	com has a lot of old movies to chose from .
neutral	its a good thing not to order a new release , because by the time you get the movie , it will be an oldie but goodie !
neutral	i had an bad_experience during my first and second purchase .... late response !
neutral	i was in the market for a new pair of sunglasses and shopped_around a little .
neutral	vision_direct was a third cheaper_than a big sunglass chain in out local mall .
neutral	i chose to buy through them because i thought they were australian based , and paid $_00 for express shipping .
neutral	my sunglasses arrived after two_weeks from hong_kong .
neutral	it was in great condition very carefully_packed and the lens cleaner you get with it is very handy .
neutral	the only question mark i have is that the receipt i got from them did not match the price i paid , instead it came in u $ and even then was much_cheaper_than what i paid .
neutral	so if this is something you want to claim back from somewhere you might have to follow_up on that .
neutral	nice place to get personalized credit_cards and discounted_gift_cards , but the design search_feature does not work very well .
neutral	i also wanted the cards shipped to my work so i could sign for them , but my charge card has my home address .
neutral	this sight would not allow me to do this and immediately cancelled the order .
neutral	so the hour i spent shopping and designing cards was totally gone .
neutral	no second chance , no warning , just cancelled .
neutral	the customer_service agent was no help in figuring_out why the order was cancelled .
neutral	so i tried again with a tiny change in my address .
neutral	cancelled again .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	so thought third times a charm .... changed to have it shipped to my home address .
neutral	not a good choice since no one is home when they deliver mail , so they will leave a note that says i need to go to the post_office ( which is also only open when i work ) to pick_up the package .
neutral	every other place i have ordered from delivers to my business address , no questions_asked .
neutral	such a huge_variety of products .
neutral	although a little over priced .
neutral	i called a few_times , the first time i called the lady was rude and not very helpful .
neutral	so i called back to see if the next person would be the same way she was ok but wasn_'_t really helpful .
neutral	i called back for a 0rd time and that person was very friendly and very helpful .
neutral	great prices , fast service !
neutral	but , they gave my email address out so that my spam box was overflowing before i ever got the part !
neutral	i really hate that !
neutral	the first person i spoke with told me that if i consolidated my loans i could get a new interest_rate of 0 %.
neutral	after filing paperwork , handing_over all of my personal information ( which i hate to do in the first place ), pay my first payment of $_000 , i then recieve a follow_up call that walks me through the application_process .
neutral	first of all , i was under the impression that i was paying them to fill_out all of the forms for me .
neutral	second , when we went through it my interest_rate would now be 0 . 00 %!
neutral	absolutely_ridiculous !
neutral	now i have to wait for a follow_up call to cancel this program and get my money back .
neutral	overall , a real waste of time and energy .
neutral	ok , i just received a phone_call from kevin rice from national_debt_relief , within 00_minutes of posting this review .
neutral	i '_m really impressed with the follow_up and his genuine concern for my unfortunate experience .
neutral	this is the service i originally expected from using their service .
neutral	i was able to give him feedback that i hope will make everyone else '_s experience better .
neutral	two_thumbs_up to kevin rice and his care for the organization .
neutral	he assured_me that i would be fully refunded , quickly .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	the " toy " i ordered was so small , my cat wouldn_'_t even look at it and the food she turned her nose up at .
neutral	however , she does love the catnip ball .
neutral	overall , i did not get my moneys worth .
neutral	i have ordered in the past and was satisfied .
neutral	great selection and prices but shipping was too slow :(
neutral	i found the ordering process and being kept_informed top_class and would recommend .
neutral	the price was good but what i appreciated was being_able to pick a delivery slot ( and a saturday too ) that was the decision making factor into buying with ao .
neutral	the only_downside thus_far was the delivery .
neutral	i ' d put on my order that the only way into our house is up a number of steps .
neutral	i ' d spoken and email customers services again to make that point .
neutral	we then got a very , very grumpy response from the delivery_men .
neutral	my husband helped them with getting the oven into the house and fortunately for them and us - although i ' d paid to have our old oven removed , we ' d actually had it removed by someone earlier in the day so they didn_'_t have that to contend with .
neutral	i do understand we were the last delivery in a long day .
neutral	however the access to our house was no secret and hence this grumpy attitude wasn_'_t really appreciated .
neutral	i '_m just glad i didn_'_t ask them to unpack it too !
neutral	prices are on the high side for some items .
neutral	try amazon , esp .
neutral	if you can get free_shipping .
neutral	north_shore deliveries have always been prompt .
neutral	i like petbest but i did not receive the quality of service i expected .
neutral	i ordered two bags of dog_food and one bag was not what i ordered .
neutral	love the room .
neutral	last_minute booking on a spur of the moment girls get away .
neutral	paid in full to find out there was an_additional 000 fee when i checked in for cleaning & insurance !
neutral	i will not book again , hotels clean the rooms without fees !
neutral	i loved the idea of making a personalized_visa_card for a friend who was getting_married , and that one came within a couple of days of ordering and was a big_hit .
neutral	unfortunately , the other gift_card i ordered never arrived .
neutral	what arrived instead was a gift_card for someone_else .
neutral	clearly , our orders were mixed up .
neutral	i called customer_service and was asked to destroy the errant gift_card , which i did .
neutral	despite my reservations , i accepted her suggestion of waiting to see if the card i actually ordered would arrive .
neutral	it did not , and the event for which it was ordered , a first communion , passed without it .
neutral	i called back to report this and was offered a refund .
neutral	i asked for the card to be reissued instead , but was told that to do that , i had to reorder , then call customer_service for what would amount to another refund .
neutral	too much work !!
neutral	i accepted the refund and ordered a gift_card from another site for my niece '_s belated gift .
neutral	what it boils down to is : this was my first and last giftcards . com order .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from this site three_times now .
neutral	the first time , i was ordering for a contest i was doing , and ordered around 00 discounted cards to give out as prizes .
neutral	i received approximately 000 confirmation emails - a glitch in the system .
neutral	i called about 0_weeks_later to check on the delivery and was told they had been sent .
neutral	then got a call a few_days_later saying they didn_'_t have a few of the cards in stock , so they were refunding the difference - obviously , the order had not been sent !
neutral	i asked to have the shipping expedited given this was now almost 0_weeks since ordering , i eventually got to someone_who said they would .
neutral	i got the order a week or so later - via standard mail .
neutral	it was not expedited .
neutral	second order was much smaller as i was understandably concerned after the first experience .
neutral	though i did get everything i ordered , it took close to 0_weeks to get it via regular mail .
neutral	though snail_mail is slow , it '_s not that slow .
neutral	they sat on the order too long before shipping it out .
neutral	third order was even smaller - one card ... but that one arrived in about a week with no_issues !
neutral	i know you can pay to expedite shipping , but i think a week is an appropriate amount of time for the free standard shipping , and if you ' re trying to save_money by purchasing discounted cards , paying for shipping is counter productive .
neutral	i think the idea of a gift_card that people can add to online is great but i have a few criticisms .
neutral	why do you ask people to go to the trouble to write a message on the card and then not print it on the card ?
neutral	when the card came to me blank and i called and i was told it was not your policy to print personal messages on the card .
neutral	also , why is the mailing so expensive ?
neutral	$ 0 for " regular " mail that you say takes 0 to 00 days .
neutral	it never takes that long for my regular mail .
neutral	i paid $_00 to get the card in 0 or 0 days .
neutral	that '_s too steep for me .
neutral	some of my donors said they couldn_'_t get onto the website .
neutral	i ordered my book last_week monday and it is now tuesday the following week and still no book !
neutral	hopefully it gets here tomorrow as i really needed it yesterday .
neutral	i understand shipping may take long , but i git an_email_confirmation last tuesday that the item had shipped , but then why is it not here then ?
neutral	i usually get my orders from amazon a lot quicker even if it says 0 - 00 days .
neutral	they seem to be 0 or less days for shipping time .
neutral	found villa to be just what we wanted and needed , know the area well ,
neutral	cleaner very nice , there was some renovations taking place next door , and next but one , found the noise loud and there was some_sort of smell that was awful , and sore on the eyes .
neutral	know this is unavoidable , but wonted to tell you .
neutral	the pool is odd shape so when i asked for size , was little disappointed when got there , but being heated was a bonus .
neutral	did not go at all as_promised over the phone .
neutral	the manager at the storage_unit finally showed_up and worked things out but not at all in the way i was led to believe .
neutral	would not go this route again .
neutral	sparefoot needs to get their facts straight before they mislead customers over the phone .
neutral	shipping was slow but products were great and exactly how they appeared in picture !
neutral	i '_m a happy customer .
neutral	a good price for reasonable cover but despite them having all my medical records , this being the 0rd year i have used them they subjected me to lengthy and repetitive questioning over the phone which i found upsetting and unnecessary .
neutral	i have been losing_weight after my second baby so e0p has_been a god_send for me .
neutral	i have been able to get nice tops that fit me at each_stage of my weight_loss without_breaking the bank .
neutral	however the sizing on trousers is so_far off , i bought a pair of size 00s a while back and since then i have dropped to a slim size 00 and the trousers are still nowhere_near buttoning up !
neutral	the leg length is always long so for me ( 0 " 0 ) even with heels they are too long and i think that should be mentioned in the description .
neutral	shoes are also a little on the small fitting side .
neutral	postage is good , orders come quickly and tracking them is excellent .
neutral	another thing worth_mentioning is the quality is great - especially for the price about 00_% of the time , you will get some items that will fall_apart after a few washes or lose their shape .
neutral	for me thats not a problem as i am replacing with smaller clothes anyway after a couple of months but if your weight is stable you wont get long_term use from the clothes .
neutral	i was a bit_confused purchasing this gift_card , as it is supposed to be for jose tejas and when the card previewed it was a discover card ... did not have jose tejas on it .
neutral	as i have not yet received the card , i cannot respond on time_frame .
neutral	( card was ordered 00 - 00 - 00 )
neutral	i have ordered in the past , before you had the other company call for the prescriptions , with out a problem .
neutral	this order was a mess .
neutral	i drove 00_miles to my vets to find out what the problem was .
neutral	my vet faxed the prescription on april 0th and april 0th .
neutral	i saw the confirmations that the faxes went through .
neutral	but vet works ( or whatever their name is ) kept saying that my vet said i was not a client of theirs .
neutral	i have 0 animals there .
neutral	after a week we finally got it taken_care of after several phones calls and emails and of course me driving to the vets to see if they were messing it up .
neutral	i am very hesitant to place another order through pet_flow .
neutral	flyers hebben een_goede_kwaliteit ; er is snel contact gelegd als het formaat aangepast dient te worden .
neutral	levering met dhl zorgde voor enkele problemen , maar drukland heeft het positief opgelost .
neutral	everything is high end and over priced .
neutral	the uggs are cheaper at norstroms .
neutral	they have very nice things but since they dont have an english option , makes it hard to know what your buying and how much .
neutral	american consumers would jump on that if they could read what it was .
neutral	makes doing anything impossible .
neutral	is incomaptible with my school and what they allow to upload .
neutral	if u wanna upgrade you mac it cost just as much as a new notebook from dell , that comes with all the programing you need
neutral	this was my first purchase on petflow . com .
neutral	i wanted my order shipped to my son in another_state .
neutral	i paid for the order and clearly put in a different ship to address .
neutral	it seemed to take_forever so i started to track the order .
neutral	not only did it take_forever , but it was shipped to my address so i now have to ship it again , at my expense out to his address , across the country .
neutral	not a very good first experience .
neutral	my room had already been rented and was locked from the inside then switched to another room and someone came in my room when i was sleeping
neutral	shipping cost extremely high
neutral	i ordered the lion mask .
neutral	it is huge and doesn_'_t even come close to fitting my face .
neutral	i will have to alter it and do some cutting on it .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting it to be wonderful , but was dissapointed in the size .
neutral	my last order was , unfortunately , very disappointing .
neutral	of the three garments i ordered only 0 is entirely satisfactory .
neutral	the two jumpers which i ordered in m / l are nowhere_near that , the more accurate sizing would have been s / m and i prefer jumpers to be bigger rather_than smaller .
neutral	i usually wash everything before i wear them in a delicate cycle with woolite .
neutral	unfortunately one of the jumpers , which appears to be a diffirent cotton than the other showed a lot of bobbling when i took it out of the machine .
neutral	having received my lenses promptly i was keen to put them into use straight_away .
neutral	however they were very difficult due to flimsy materials .
neutral	they kept turning inside out , and attatching to my fingers instead of my eyes .
neutral	i have given up for now but will try again later .
neutral	my eyes are now very sore and bloodshot .
neutral	i accidentally ordered two of the same part .
neutral	customer_service was contacted twice regarding the return of one item .
neutral	i never_heard back from the company
neutral	i love this product but i feel there should be a discount for ordering bulk and that it should be packed better when shipped .
neutral	on this order i receive 0 cracked cases and the last order i purchased i received 0 cracked cases and hope to get this resolved with the company .
neutral	our translator provided only basic translation of the subject matter .
neutral	luckily we had many mandarin speakers in the audience who were able to understand the speaker directly and also provide clarification where crucial details were left out of the translation .
neutral	after the first day ( we had booked for 0 - days ) our speaker went over the subject matter with the translator again , but at the following two talks ( different audiences , same topic ) the translation continued to be very basic .
neutral	this was not overly critical for our purposes as many people had a basic to fluent knowledge of chinese , but it is something to be aware of .
neutral	additionally , by the end of the three_days , the translator was providing answers to questions from third_parties directly based on points raised during previous meetings / presentations .
neutral	as a non_- expert on the issues , i did not think this was appropriate and asked her to translate the questions to the speaker directly .
neutral	the table is lovely and very well made .
neutral	i ordered online as this is more convenient for me and i received 0 phone_calls on the same day regarding my order .
neutral	if i ' d wanted wax or warranty i would have added it to my order myself .
neutral	also i was given the option online of express delivery at a cost of 00 . 00 which i did not opt for as was in no rush .
neutral	the first date for the express delivery was 0th sept which was the day it was delivered on anyway free of charge .
neutral	this is obviously a way to get more money out of you !
neutral	an easy to use website with a number of weekly offers .
neutral	if only the ' free gifts ' weren_'_t so small !
neutral	pretty good prices , but not sure what they mean by fast shipping .
neutral	placed my order on wednesday_evening and it wasn_'_t even shipped until friday_afternoon .
neutral	ups says it '_s not scheduled to be delivered until wednesday .
neutral	i signed_up for auto_ship , but if this is a sign of how slow they are i may cancel , just so i don_'_t have to worry_about it .
neutral	i was ordering from another . com company who '_s delivery was 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i switched to chewy '_s because the prices were a bit better .
neutral	i was told to expect an_email when it shipped ... none arrived .
neutral	i would use you again if updates were part of the service
neutral	good clothes and didn_'_t take long to come but one item was out of stock so i didn_'_t get it
neutral	the collar itself is not bad but my dog only weighs 0 lbs and the collar is too wide and bulky for him .
neutral	it would be nice to have a thinner version of the collar for smaller dogs .
neutral	i was attracted to this site because the ads draw you in , the clothes are high fashion and on trend .
neutral	however i have ordered a few items around 0 now and half of the items i have had to send back , quality is not great .
neutral	photos look good !
neutral	item isn_'_t as good as you would expect .
neutral	i also wasn_'_t impressed with customer_service ( no phone_number , just emails ) i have had to send many emails too .
neutral	00 days to get a refund is not good if you are not happy with an item or the item is faulty !!
neutral	i won_'_t be using them again as it is too long_winded and too stressful .
neutral	sorry for negative_feedback , on a positive , i do like your clothes in the photos though !
neutral	costume looked great and was everything we were promised .
neutral	two issues : no email_confirmation or shipment confirmation .
neutral	expensive shipping .
neutral	my main complaint is with the website .
neutral	i can never find the means to search for a specific show .
neutral	" find event " doesn_'_t help .
neutral	i don_'_t want to have to scroll_through a bunch of shows i have no interest in .
neutral	in the interest of being even - handed , i will also say that getting tickets through goldstar is very reliable and easy , which is much_appreciated .
neutral	after_researching , i '_m sure i read i can update my credit_report and score on a daily_basis .
neutral	now it appears i can only update my report / score once a month .
neutral	that '_s disappointing .
neutral	that was the main draw to identity_guard since i am in the market currently for a mortgage loan .
neutral	waiting 00 days is too long for an update .
neutral	i was considering canceling another credit service i use , but maybe not now !
neutral	i loved the dress that i ordered but was not very pleased with the fact that i did not recieve an_email letting_me know that the jacket i also order was out of stock .
neutral	it would have been nice to be notified that everything i ordered would not be coming .
neutral	otherwise i like all the products and shipping time is excellent .
neutral	when i first called to order my pool i spoke with a customer_service representative named ann .
neutral	( ask for her if you '_ve never ordered a pool before .)
neutral	she was kind , courteous and very helpful .
neutral	we found that the pool was dented at the top ( this must have occurred during shipping ) and opted to fix it ourselves rather_than return it .
neutral	after we installed the pool liner we noticed a small_hole in the liner .
neutral	tears form by pulling on the liner too hard during installation , not a small_hole .
neutral	we were told to send an emailed photo to familypoolfun . com but the owner of the company declined to send us a new one and offered to send me another for $_000 . 00 another customer_service rep told me i could buy a patch kit from them but i declined because i was worried because the pool was new and i wanted a perfectly good liner .
neutral	we decided to order another liner ( heavier grade and less money from another company .)
neutral	they do offer rebates and freebies -- mine was a $_000 . 00 rebate , an automatic pool_cleaner and free gas , but there are forms that must be filled out precisely and mailed to them .
neutral	they don_'_t just send them to you automatically .
neutral	be sure you send your rebate paper ( to any company ) with some kind of tracking because i was initially told my rebate did not arrive but they did find it and send it to me .
neutral	i also received my automatic cleaner ( so glad )-- but be sure you are careful with sending everything with delivery confirmation to be sure they receive it .
neutral	my pool is running fine and i '_m pleased with the things i ordered to set it up correctly .
neutral	most of this is due to the excellent pre_- pool order help i received from ann , the customer_service representative .
neutral	i wish i could give you a higher rating , but many_times on note cards and especially on tote bags , the color shown on the screen for both my art and your background color varies greatly from what i get in the finished_product .
neutral	i know screen colors can '_t always be exactly matched , but i '_ve had a variance that is just way too much .
neutral	i placed an order which took over a month to arrive at my door .
neutral	some of the items were cancelled due to the fact that they were out of stock .
neutral	i love the selection on the website .
neutral	they ' re not what you would see in any mall in us , and the fact that they sell asian_clothing is appealing to me since i am asian myself ( and i '_m into these styles of clothing ) the price is another downfall for this website especially for low - income people such as students in this economy .
neutral	they ' re not outrageously expensive , but they ' re not cheap either .
neutral	what keeps me coming_back to this website is the seemingly infinite selection of clothing , makeup , and accessories .
neutral	i would order once in a blue moon , not frequently
neutral	would i recommend this site ?
neutral	maybe .
neutral	only for people with patience and money .
neutral	in short :
neutral	pros
neutral	- huge_selection of all things fashion / makeup / etc
neutral	- high definition ( not fuzzy ) pictures
neutral	- most items have a variety of pictures
neutral	- good customer_service
neutral	- many things on sale ( mostly 00_%_off .. as far as i can tell )
neutral	- these kinds of clothing are what i would love to wear
neutral	- free_shipping with minimum purchase
neutral	cons
neutral	- price is a bit high ...
neutral	- shipping is on the slow end ...
neutral	i don_'_t think it should have taken a whole month to receive what i ordered
neutral	- you might get a little headache because they have so many things .. but maybe that is a good thing (;
neutral	the female assistant at this location does not communicate very well .
neutral	i was very shocked when they told me my balance for my repairs .
neutral	she never broke_down the cost of all the service .
neutral	may not use this store again after being a long time user .
neutral	i will recommend a friend to buy a dress on this web_site .
neutral	boxes got wet after a rain storm and collapsed , with everything on top !
neutral	!
neutral	i used diamond parking meet & greet service at_gatwick .
neutral	the service was good , and very reasonably_priced .
neutral	it was irritating to arrive at the dartford crossing late on sunday_night on our return from a weeks skiing to find the pound coins we had ( foolishly ?)
neutral	left in a closed compartment had vanished .
neutral	i have used stress_free parking several_times before , and probably will do so again .
neutral	after waiting 00 days for my dog harness / collars , they finally arrived - but were delivered to the wrong house .
neutral	i had to track them down .
neutral	as i was trying them on my dogs , one of the collars broke - and there is no return information .
neutral	not sure i will be shopping at petflow again any time soon .
neutral	i would '_ve rated you a 0 , but after i got the coupon , i felt duped and overcharged and now i wish you would honor the coupon and credit me the 00_%.
neutral	following my review , the issue was reviewed and resolved .
neutral	a full_refund has_been promised and i '_m very satisfied with this response .
neutral	thank_you , cdkeys .
neutral	very easy to sign_up to multitrip however i missed the area where it asked for health insurance so i paid an extra €_00 , when i emailed multitrip to confirm my healthcare number and tell them i expected the €_00 refund they never responded !!
neutral	lets just say when the insurance is up next year i wont be renewing with them !
neutral	very confusing how to figure_out how to use your process
neutral	well , my son has large feet and after traipsing_around numerous shops he found that the only shoes that suit him are the ones i paid for at ... whatever the shop is called ... can '_t remember the name .
neutral	so , bought two_pairs and spent enough to not pay postage , but then got an_email to say only one pair in stock ( get it right , that '_s such a nuisance ) so i agreed to buy them because the poor lad can feel the ground through his shoes .... then got stung for £ 0 p_& p .
neutral	that '_s a bit mean , not my fault you didn_'_t have two_pairs and i thought i shouldn_'_t have been charged it .
neutral	but there you go , it doesn_'_t encourage loyalty ,.
neutral	the big_bus_tour overall was fine , but i had several negative experiences .
neutral	0 .
neutral	looking for a stop to board the bus for the first time , i ended_up walking about an_hour , using the free route map as my guide to find a stop to hop on .
neutral	unfortunatly , the stops are not well marked and consist of a red or blue dot on a regular city bus sign .
neutral	i had no_idea that this is what i was looking for -- i assumed the stops would have more obvious markings -- and wasted a lot of time .
neutral	more specific descriptions and instructions on the map would be really helpful .
neutral	0 .
neutral	my first ride , when i finally found the bus to board , was the blue line with the recorded_tour .
neutral	i plugged in my headset and sat in silence for about 00 + minutes , thinking it was a long break between updates but finally realizing that the headphone connection at my seat was broken .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i got left behind at the end of the day when i was standing at a crowded stop ( several tour lines , etc_.).
neutral	the last big_bus of the day stopped , someone at the front of the crowd spoke briefly to the driver , then the driver pulled away before i could get past the crowd .
neutral	i had to pay 00_pounds for a taxi back to my hotel .
neutral	the staff was friendly and knowledgable about space and the right fit .
neutral	am_currently battling with ring worm with one of my horses so ordered some imaverol to treat this .
neutral	animed '_s price was fractionally cheaper_than other online providers and included postage .
neutral	product arrived in good time - there was a small problem with the packaging and the post_office had repacked it in a plastic container as animed '_s packing had come apart .
neutral	the bottle was intact , however ,
neutral	una amiga mía tuvo una operación .
neutral	envié las flores al hospital pero nunca llegaron .
neutral	contacté algunas veces por internet a floraqueen y pasaba días sin oír nada .
neutral	por fin me contactó pero ella ya estaba en casa .
neutral	la compañía envió las flores a su casa y por fin llegaron pero muy tarde .
neutral	me alegro que a lo menos corrija el error por fin .
neutral	the first week was fabulous !
neutral	i lost 00_pounds !!
neutral	ya !
neutral	until you eat normal food ( still watching what i ate ) then by monday you have gained all back but 0 - 0 pounds ... then the meals get worse , the veggies are always overcooked and mushy ... puke !
neutral	the other thing that really makes your stomach turn is they over use cumin .
neutral	eww nasty and you just cant take it by week three .
neutral	at this point you have finally lost the rest of the weight but now don_'_t loose any more and you throw at_least half your meal in the garbage .
neutral	if you decide to do this program ...
neutral	choose the seven day and hopefully they will lay off the cumin and stop over cooking their veggies !
neutral	i bought brainchild vitamins and minerals .
neutral	i realized after i ordered , i actually paid $ 0 more on pure_formulas for each bottle .
neutral	even with
neutral	free_shipping i still paid $ 0 more than i had ordering straight from brainchild and paying shipping .
neutral	i was able to find all the books i needed for school on this website for a reasonable price ( great !)
neutral	and my order was processed quickly ( doubly great !)
neutral	however ... school has already started and its been over two_weeks and i haven_'_t received my books .
neutral	i was able to shoot an_email to customer_service and was answered ina timely_matter about my order but when i '_m told my books will get to me 0 - 00 business days it ' d be nice to stay true to that !
neutral	hi ,
neutral	i find your website clear and easy to use and you have a large product range .
neutral	i like that you include delivery in the price to avoid confusion about final cost .
neutral	the delivery should have been before 0pm next_day , however it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	i had to chase up , got an apologetic email and parcel arrived the following working day .
neutral	phew !
neutral	that was christmas_eve ...
neutral	yes will recommend to others and would use again - not at last_minute though ...
neutral	this is a wonderful product and it is easy to check balances and activate cards ; however , i had to make the cards several_times because ( despite the fact that i was logged in ) my cart failed to save .
neutral	in addition all of the cards were mailed separately , this meant that i paid 00 different shipping and handling_fees when i would have rather paid one and had them all shipped together in one envelope .
neutral	i picked_up my car in florence , the service left something to be desired , total disinterest and a long wait time , 00_minutes for the paper_work and 00_minutes for the car to actually arrive .
neutral	car was upgraded dont want to seem ungrateful but i actually wanted a small car .
neutral	us customers should be aware of new law in italy that requires snow chains on board between november and april if you go out of city center .
neutral	rental_agency does have notice , well hidden and in small_print , there is a fine for the driver for not having chains .
neutral	there are actually checks on motorway entrances , result you need to spend extra 00_euro for this pleasure , which is not refundable even if they are unused and the agency will not make you aware of this requirement , they told me that it was my responsability to know the law !
neutral	drop_off was equally unimpressive not easy because there is no garage at this agency and the street is very narrow with no parking space ,
neutral	staff were disinterested , bearing on rude .
neutral	however price when prepaid is very competitive , car was not cleaned before collection , should mention that i speak fluent italian so could probably make my point better_than the average tourist .
neutral	i have experienced long delivery times each time but now we are at 0 days to cross 0 states .
neutral	i would think there is a better way .
neutral	i use many forums with free_shipping and they are very quick .
neutral	i order the same dog_food every_month and every_month there is a different total .
neutral	my experience with opticfast was frustrating .
neutral	i bought from opticfast through another_vendor .
neutral	the vendor apparently gave_me an erroneous shipping date .
neutral	due to this my item did not arrived in time for my daughter '_s 00st_birthday .
neutral	i was very pleased with my product from opticfast when it did finally arrive .
neutral	would like the invoice to detail amount charged per day and not just total for full term .
neutral	useful when using part business part personal .
neutral	we were very frustrated by the time it took to get a bus .
neutral	we arrived at marble_arch and went to the publicity bus that stands there .
neutral	the member of staff took our printout and issues our tickets and then told us which stop to go to .
neutral	so_far so good but we stood there for over half an_hour and when a blue bus eventually came it was going the wrong way and the driver told us we were at the wrong stop !
neutral	marble_arch is not easy to negotiate as a pedestrian so we had to go all the way under the underpass to get to the other side by after another 00_minutes we finally got on the bus we needed .
neutral	this experience made us very sceptical_about the ease of " hopping on and off " so we didn_'_t - we stayed on for the full 0 and a half hours .
neutral	once on it was good - we had a spanish visitor with us and it was brilliant as a way of her seeing loads on her only day in london .
neutral	the recorded_commentary is however not that up to date - no mention whatsoever of the shard even when sitting right by it and westminster_abbey mentioned for the funeral of princess diana but no mention of will and kate '_s wedding - leading us to conclude that the commentary has not been updated for over 0 years .
neutral	the west " loop " that took about an_hour was not really worth it as you didn_'_t actually see much apart_from harrods .
neutral	couldn_'_t understand_why we didn_'_t actually drive past the museums .
neutral	didn_'_t have time to do the free boat_tour as it is only one way and would have left us with a long journey back across london .
neutral	in conclusion this was good value particularly if booked in advance online and was a good way of making the best of a short time in london - don_'_t have any other service providers to compare it to but overall would have felt_like a much more satisfying_experience if we had not wasted an_hour at the beginning due to poor advice from your own staff .
neutral	i thought i was buying an actual gift_card , but apparently you have to log on with your password to use it .
neutral	since i got it as a gift for my daughter , it wasn_'_t really what i wanted .
neutral	i am a loyal_customer of this company .
neutral	the deals are excellent - both in price and product .
neutral	the only_thing i wish they would improve upon is the delivery of shipments that are scheduled to arrive on a regular_basis .
neutral	they often come much later than they are supposed to - and , recently , had i not signed in to my account to find out why one shipment was taking so long to arrive , i would not have found out that the hold up was an apparent " back order " status of the order .
neutral	pausing my regular shipment schedule , i placed a new order for all of the items and received them in just a couple of days ( no special " rush order " for them or anything ).
neutral	it seems as though new , " one - time " orders ship much_faster and more reliably .
neutral	other than that issue , all other aspects of this company are laudable .
neutral	excellent pre delivery service .
neutral	kept me fully_informed all day .
neutral	bit disappointed with delivery drivers , i had thought they were going to unpack the fidge freezer for me and put it in place , but they wouldn_'_t .
neutral	as a short , fat , housewife i wouldn_'_t have managed to lift a 0 ' fridge on my own , but luckily had visitors at the time so they helped once the drivers had left - otherwise it would still be sitting in the middle of the kitchen now .
neutral	i had to book my trip 0x on line and it would not take so i called - first time i called the number posted online was wrong working number then i called and got a nice customer_service rep .
neutral	everything seemed to be very efficient and the tyres are great but no - one asked if we wanted tracking or balancing done at the same time , this wasn_'_t included in the price and we were told we ' d have to return the next_day for this .
neutral	why would you get new tyres without balancing and tracking done at the same time ?
neutral	i ordered the wrong_size seeing only a size 0 and not knowing that meant uk0 and not us0 , so the boots i received were 0 sizes too big .
neutral	the customer_service representative took a long time to get to me but was patient .
neutral	if you order the correct item in the correct size , you will get a legitimate product at a great price , but if not , return shipping will cost you .
neutral	$_00 return shipping on a pair of $_000 boots is a bit much ,
neutral	that '_s pretty_much it .
neutral	i arrived at town_fair for a 0pm scheduled appointment , checked in and assumed that service would begin shortly_thereafter .
neutral	by 0pm , not having any communication with any employee , i approached the front_desk and asked if there was some kind of problem .
neutral	only then , after 0 hour of wait time , i was told that the truck carrying my items had not yet arrived at the store .
neutral	i stated to the employee at the desk that i would have liked to have been made aware that there was going to be a delay - he stated that " it was not his fault , he knew nothing about it ."
neutral	i told him that , as a team , it probably wasn_'_t in the stores best interest to " throw someone_else under the bus ."
neutral	i was told that the bus was on it '_s way and would be at the store shortly .
neutral	i then expected a bit of a delay , went to another store to purchase a drink ad watched the delivery truck pull in awhile later .
neutral	i have now been waiting for service for 0 hours .
neutral	i returned to the waiting area and saw that my car was , indeed , in the service bay .
neutral	another hour went by again ( i was told when i made my appointment that the service would take 00_minutes ) with no contact from any employee .
neutral	i approached the desk a second time only to be told there was a problem removing a tire from my car .
neutral	i asked when anyone was going to tell me that and requested to see the store manager .
neutral	the store manger , nick , came out apologized for all that had happened and told me what was going on .
neutral	from this point on , the experience began a positive track .
neutral	the issue with my tire was a difficult one but it was dealt_with and the service was excellent .
neutral	nick has taken_care of the entire issue with professionalism and i intend to go back in the fall for a new set of tires for another car .
neutral	shipping is super slow and i don_'_t know about product because i still_haven_'_t got it .
neutral	but prices are cheap .
neutral	i ordered clothes from moddeals and they did not fit correctly so i tried returning 0 items .
neutral	only 0 were considered " returned " and i got them exchanged .
neutral	however , the 0th item was not considered " returned " and was no sent back to me and i did not get a refund in money for the clothing item .
neutral	all items were returned in the same package so not sure how they could " lose " the item .
neutral	not as user_friendly as seamless , but always gives out good deals and discounts !
neutral	delivery arrived on time , however , 0 of the chairs are damaged and i have email photos and am awaiting on how the issue will be progressed further .
neutral	when i started ordering from pureformules a couple of years_ago shipping was super_fast , now shipping takes several days longer .
neutral	also , i ordered some products on 0 - 00 - 00 and i was suppose to receive posted points for that order 0 days after the products ship but today is 0 - 00 - 00 and still have not received the points .
neutral	the only_reason this even matters is that i would like to use the points .
neutral	most brands ( douglas_labs , genestra , thorne research ) i have purchased from pureformules i have been very happy with the quality .
neutral	except for integrative therapeutics brand , low quality for the expensive prices .
neutral	i have tried their products on several_occasions and every time i get burned .
neutral	i ordered a 00_pound_bag of dry_dog_food and a smaller bag of dog_treats .
neutral	the dog_food and treats were delivered in too small of a carton , thus crushing the dry treats into crumbs .
neutral	this has happened once before but petflow replaced them without_question .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why their products are not shipped in an appropriately sized carton !
neutral	we picked the car up at malpensa airport and dropped it off in mestre , opposite the train_station .
neutral	the office in mestre was supposed to open after lunch at 0 p . m .
neutral	the employee sauntered in about 0 : 00 .
neutral	there was one young_man waiting to return the car who needed to catch a train and he was almost frantic with concern .
neutral	the employee was brusque and surly and complained that we hadn_'_t parked the car in the " garage " -- even_though there was no information posted about this garage .
neutral	there was a printed notice about leaving the car after hours at the " garage " but it was not clear where this garage was or how to leave it .
neutral	while we were waiting for the employee to return from his lunch , i went to the parking facility next door ( which was a garage ) -- the person in the office there said " i '_m not avis " -- i replied i knew that but wondered where " avis " was .
neutral	i hadn_'_t ordered glasses online yet and was a bit_skeptical .
neutral	so i ordered 0 pupillary_distance rulers and a 0 pack of cleaning cloths .. 0 days_later i received 0 of the rulers and 00 days_later received the cloths ...
neutral	so i went to a different company , ordered my glasses and they were shipped 0 business days_later .... no biggie .. just glad i test ordered first to see how awfully long it could take .
neutral	your solicitor was not interested in my case !
neutral	service was good .
neutral	easy to extend the rental period .
neutral	car performed well & drop_off very easy .
neutral	price was competitive .
neutral	when i arrived to pick_up the car i was led to believe there weren_'_t any of teh compact size i have contracted for & i would need to upgrade to a larger model , at my expence .
neutral	it ended_up costing me quite a bit more than agreed_upon .
neutral	not happy about that .
neutral	0 of 0 items shipped july_0000 with expiration_date of july_0000 .
neutral	one huge disadvantage of online shopping .
neutral	this seems to be one of the better options for making cheap international_calls .
neutral	it is 0 cents less_than google_voice .
neutral	however the setup / registration part was more difficult than most other services .
neutral	they run regular promotions , but there always seems to be a problem when i attempt to use a voucher , it is not accepted .
neutral	i accidentally made a purchase and they have not refunded my money or responded .
neutral	i have made alot of purchases through wowcher i had some great deals , although some not so great and hasnt been worth the deal price let_alone anything higher .
neutral	now i am more careful with what i buy and think on before i click the buy now .
neutral	all in all the some good deals to be had .
neutral	brilliant service in terms of simplicity and ease of use , but i was disappointed that my things did not arrive in time even_though i paid for them to do so .
neutral	this is the first time i have ever booked a cruise .
neutral	very unhappy that the original cruise i had paid a deposit on was suddenly changed - not the cruise agent '_s fault - but this should never have happened .
neutral	felt very disappointed and let_down to then have to look at going on a different ship which isnt as grand .
neutral	this caused a lot of anxiety to myself and my other family_members ... not good .. so close to christmas .
neutral	i used bookit . com to book our hotel and rental_car .
neutral	at the end when it came to push the button to book it , it came up with , " oops , something went wrong , please call an agent ."
neutral	so , i called an agent and the trip was booked all over again .
neutral	however , prices kept changing on the hotel each time i looked but the next_morning when i printed the itinerary out , i noticed two different bookit numbers and realized the trip got booked twice !
neutral	the " oops an_error occurred , call an agent " resulted in the trip being booked and a lag in their computer system did not allow the agent i called to see that the trip , had in fact , been booked .
neutral	what a mess to get taken_care of .
neutral	frank was very helpful though and took his time to get this mess straightened_out .
neutral	all i care about is having a room and a car when we get there april 00rd !
neutral	i hope it all worked out .
neutral	i purchased a bowl to stop my dog from rating so fast .
neutral	he used it twice but now will not eat out of it .
neutral	i also purchased a roll of turkey dog_food .
neutral	he ate it twice and threw it back up for 0 days .
neutral	this is not unusual behaviour but i had high_hopes .
neutral	it will not keep me from purchasing again from pet_flow .
neutral	the original booking i made went perfectly .
neutral	but the first leg of my outgoing flight was cancelled due to weather ( nobody '_s fault , i know ).
neutral	when i called travelocity ( who didn_'_t call to let_me know , it was the airline that did that ) i was told their system was " updating " and i needed to call back in two hours .
neutral	this was at about 0pm est , so it wasn_'_t in the middle of the night or some other off - peak time , and since this was a major winter_storm i would have never gotten another flight if i ' d waited two hours to rebook .
neutral	i gave up on travelocity and called the airline , which was able to book me immediately and with no trouble .
neutral	this has made me feel_like travelocity is great as an initial fare finder , but if trouble crops up you might well be on your own .
neutral	i was happy to be able to order a gift_card for a dear_friend who is getting_married .
neutral	it was a group gift from her co - workers and we didn_'_t want to just give her cash .
neutral	i am not sure why there was such a large fee plus additional shipping_charges .
neutral	i ended_up paying the fees out of my pocket because i didn_'_t want to use the money we collected toward fees and shipping .
neutral	when you order a gift_card from a store there is no fee and sometimes there is even free_shipping .
neutral	additionally , i think the card should come in a gift box .
neutral	after all it is a gift .
neutral	order a list of items for christmas .
neutral	i received the package about 0 and a half weeks after ordering then upon_opening my box .
neutral	i found out a few items were missing .
neutral	went_ahead and contacted customer_service and a month later still_haven_'_t had anything resolved .
neutral	the price is right .
neutral	but the coffee doesn_'_t have as good flavor as nespresso .
neutral	i will drink it until my 000 pods are gone , but i will not serve it to guests .
neutral	compared to nespresso , this decaf has a sharper bite to the flavor .
neutral	it lacks the deep smoothness of nespresso .
neutral	pc_game supplies a great variety of game_cards .
neutral	quick and within the 00 minute mark , however , i think the worldwide option is still quite restricted to certain areas .
neutral	i have friends from other_countries that play american games and would like to be able to purchase cards to play .
neutral	i would use this website again .
neutral	i was able to rent a space fairly quickly .
neutral	only one big problem .
neutral	when i drove 00_minutes from home to see the space , the woman in the office told me there wasn_'_t one available and didn_'_t know why the website shown it available .
neutral	by luck , someone had just moved out the night before and a space supposedly opened up .
neutral	in the mean time , while i waited all day for a confirmation , i had to book another storage company .
neutral	when i received my package , the box was damaged .
neutral	it looked like someone took a knife , and stabbed at it .
neutral	the replacement car mirror i ordered was undamaged , though , which is the most_important .
neutral	it '_s just a little enraging to see the box for something fragile look like someone beat the crap out of it .
neutral	i '_m accustomed to quickly shipped orders through amazon and other_websites , so waiting soooo long for an order seems crazy now .
neutral	thus , my experience so_far has_been one of waiting for it to be delivered .
neutral	convenient ?
neutral	sure .
neutral	fast ?
neutral	no .
neutral	plan way in advance if you need pet_food or treats .
neutral	placed an order with amazon and got my order 0_weeks_later very slow shipping
neutral	i was pleased i had located the glasses cheaper elsewhere however i like them i am a little un - sure they are the real burberry '_s as i ordered them from what i believed was a aus company to learn they were coming in from hong_kong so still not sure i have paid over $_000 . 00 + for something that might not be the real mycoy !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was about to hang up because i ' d been on hold so long and the music was really annoying me when tobias answered .
neutral	he was very helpful and informed about the storage company i was considering , and it was good that he also had info about a second company i had on my list .
neutral	i was able to book my reservation through tobias , so all seemed convenient .
neutral	but , there were several issues - the online reservation system doesn_'_t interface well with the in store system , so my rental process took more than an_hour .
neutral	even_though i arrived at 0 :_00pm and the facility closes at 0pm , i was barely able to get my belongings into my locker before closing time because of all the time it took to rent the locker .
neutral	the second issue for me is that there were hidden_charges like an administrative fee , a monthly mandatory insurance fee , and the requirement that i purchase a cylinder lock , so it cost me $_00 in fees to get my first month '_s rent " free ".
neutral	i feel that these fees should have been discussed with me at the time i reserved my locker , not when i was sitting at the storage company attempting to finalize the transaction .
neutral	i had actually asked if i should bring my own lock .
neutral	i was told i could , so i did , but even with my own padlock , i was still required to purchase a cylinder lock for $_00 +.
neutral	this doesn_'_t sit well with me , sorry .
neutral	the third issue was that i had reserved a locker for the next_day , but rented it the same day i reserved .
neutral	i got an_email the next_day reminding me to rent my locker or to cancel my reservation .
neutral	if i have a reservation and i '_ve already rented , you guys should be able to figure it out and not send an_email reminding me to rent .
neutral	my nearest best buy is quite a long trip from my home and workplace .
neutral	i like to pick items up rather_than wait around for deliveries though .
neutral	i regularly use the bestbuy website to arrange collect at store purchases and have never had a problem .
neutral	admittedly , sometimes they ' re more_expensive than mail order only places but the convenience and speed makes it worth using them for urgent purchases .
neutral	i can '_t comment on their returns_policy because i '_ve never had a problem with anything i '_ve bought .
neutral	i guess that '_s a plus !
neutral	well i ordered my part '_s no problem . recieved them on pretty good time but , when needed to send core back to get my money back they didn_'_t send aynthing to say where it '_s supposed to be sent to so i can get my money back . so had to go online and find phone_number wait 0 extra day '_s when they opened again , then wait to talk to somebody to find out where i send it . that is something that you ' d think they would automatically send the the new part if your suppose to send back the core . can '_t help to wonder_if they do that on purpose so it will hopefully take you longer_than the 00 day '_s so they can keep the core fee in their pocket and tell you oh well it '_s our '_s now .
neutral	i called before placing my order to see if i needed anything_else to mount my headlights and was informed they didn_'_t come with mounting brackets and i needed to order these ... $_00 dollars later they come in and i didn_'_t need them ... money wasted .. that i didn_'_t really have to waste .. now i have parts that are of no use to me ..
neutral	after going through the sample_pack that came with my espresso maker , i ordered these to save some money .
neutral	some were okay , while others seemed packed too tight and barely allowed water through .
neutral	i was kind of disappointed .
neutral	i might try to find other options at a similar price in the future .
neutral	y have a toll_free number if u not going to answer ???
neutral	i placed sn order on aug 00 , 0000 for a jw pet large dog toy ... and as of this date sep 00 , 0000 , not received it nor will yu all answer the phones ... but u can continue 0 charge my acct 0 my monthly gift box .
neutral	please refund my money or send the merchandise or i will no_longer order an post my displeasure on fb .
neutral	thank u ,
neutral	linda womack
neutral	i ordered some dog wormer for the first time from this company and when they came they was in the right packaging but i just happens to check before putting them away and inside i noticed that they had put cat wormer in the dog wormer packaging so i rang them and they sent out the correct wormer and i returned the cat wormer at no cost to me just a good job i checked lol .
neutral	would make me think about it before ordering again but they did rectify the ' re mistake
neutral	as i am dealing_with lymphedema , i '_ve been ordering compression hose / socks from foryourlegs .
neutral	i first selected free_shipping and it took a long time to receive merchandise .
neutral	then i had to return some things i " d ordered ( for i realize now that i neednthigh high , not knee high ) and that process worked okay but took about two months to get money refunded but it did happen without my having to contact them .
neutral	current issue is i now need panty hose r ( situation not controlled by thigh_high for my legs too long for thigh_high ) - and no where can i find out which brand has the longest leg .
neutral	they cost a lot of money and i hate to spend hundreds of dollars trying the various_options .
neutral	i would love it if there were an expert who i could talk to at foryourlegs who would give me some insight_into the various brands so i have better chance of getting right one .
neutral	the directions to the embassy_suites hotel by o ' hare airport were totally wrong so we missed the shuttle and could not wait for the next one or we would be late for our flight !
neutral	we ended_up paying $_00 for a cab to get there in time .
neutral	then while we were gone on our trip someone hit our yukon in the parking_lot and i am still dealing_with having that fixed !
neutral	but at_least it was reported and is being paid for to fix it .
neutral	not a great experience overall but the shuttle driver on the way back was great .
neutral	i cannot give you a review , except the product i ordered was shipped early than_expected .
neutral	i have called the 000 number on the bottle to ask some questions about the product , but i haven_'_t heard_anything from the company .
neutral	unfortunately for millbryhill they use a useless delivery couriers who only deliver in the mornings and depot for collection is miles_away .
neutral	otherwise i was delighted with their service .
neutral	very disappointed with having to pay for delivery then had to wait nearly a week for my purchase - would have been quicker to by it locally :-(
neutral	i live in colorado my order when to denver , co to be processed through the usps sort facility left denver went to jacksonville , florida to be processed through usps sort facility .
neutral	i am confused , why would my order go to jacksonville , florida to be processed again only to have to be shipped back to colorado delaying my order .
neutral	doesn_'_t seem logical to me .
neutral	actually not impressed , i paid for first_class delivery expensive as only a small item and it took 0 weekdays to arrive , i had to ring up company and ask where it was !
neutral	the address listed on the webiste for holiday_inn express in grapevine , tx was not the physical_address of the hotel .
neutral	i put the address in my gps and was driving in circles until i was able to get a hotel rep on the phone to give me the actual address .
neutral	this site has an excellent selection of frames !
neutral	i called customer_service with a question about how they measure the progressive line for my order , but was not satisfied with their answer , so i just ordered the frames without the prescription .
neutral	their email communication was good .
neutral	i did receive my order fairly quickly .
neutral	when i received my package the free cleaning_kit was not included & no information accompanied my order .
neutral	i received an_email to confirm receipt so i emailed customer_service to confirm receipt & see if i could get an answer to my question for future orders , but did not hear back from them .
neutral	dirty bird to go .
neutral	it '_s so good and i order from there all the time , but you guys don_'_t have it !
neutral	i would probably never use another food delivery site if i could order from this restaurant here .
neutral	also , i like the idea of the points_system but they don_'_t really have a lot of value ....
neutral	after i ordered a couple of stuff sometime ago i waited for a confirmation_email but i received nothing .
neutral	i didn_'_t know if it had shipped or not .
neutral	i was kinda worried_about my order .
neutral	it was until about 0_weeks before i received my package .
neutral	its very frustrating .
neutral	but after i received my package i was very relieved .
neutral	also , your shoe_sizes are not accurate .
neutral	the furniture i ordered is fine - it was delivered on time earlier_than i anticipated .
neutral	the oly problem i have is with the packaging .
neutral	it was very difficult to remove while maintaining the integrity of the packaging in case it had to be returned .
neutral	i ordered a tall bookcase and a small sideboard .
neutral	the bookcase was particularly difficult since the packaging could not be removed with the item standing upright - the packaging hit the ceiling .
neutral	with the item on its side the weight of the bookcase meant the packing was difficult to pull off .
neutral	this is definitely an_issue that i would consider again when buying furniture .
neutral	it was really easy to order online , but i haven_'_t received an_email_saying my gift_card has shipped , therefore , i haven_'_t received it yet .
neutral	i orderered two_pairs of running socks .
neutral	i did not realise that there were left and right foot socks on the market !
neutral	anyway i receieved three left socks and one right sock .
neutral	all packaged_nicely in pairs so guess this happened in the factory prior to arriving at barringtons ?
neutral	i have been ordering for years , and this year experienced my first real disappointment .
neutral	i purchased 0 complete arrangements at a considerable expense and anxiously awaited their arrival .
neutral	two plants arrived dead , and three more were in dire distress .
neutral	after planting , and almost_immediately 0 more plants died , then another .
neutral	i am anxiously watching over the others , to the point of paranoia , in the hopes that they make it .
neutral	i called , and will be sent replacements , but as i said after so many years and the anxiety of waiting to have all these dead or dying is very disappointing .
neutral	yesterday i bought tickets for tomorrowland in belgium .
neutral	i received the confirmation saying that the tickets will arrive 0 days before the concert but i live in mexico and i wont be in mexico 0 days before the festival , i will be travelling .
neutral	i tried to reach viagogo but it seems very dificult to reach them .
neutral	i saw that they answer in this forum so is there anyone from viagogo that could help me .
neutral	can i pick_up personally the tickets on the uk office ?
neutral	hope answers soon i spent a lot of money on those tickets .
neutral	thanks
neutral	auf_der seite von sportscheck . de ist_es mir bereits mehrfach passiert , dass von mir gewählte produkte doch nicht_mehr verfügbar waren .
neutral	das_ist_sehr ärgerlich und frustierend .
neutral	warum kann ein ausverkauftes produkt nicht einfach entfernt werden ?
neutral	postage to europe is way too much and items sell out too quickly , you should have more available , they are gone within minutes and i am somehow never quick enough :( otherwise items are good quality and worth the fiver .
neutral	shopped a lot recently but ordered a handbag and it came with the missing long strap , emailed them about it , but no reply still_waiting for them to send me the missing strap :(
neutral	some products broke the first time of use .
neutral	some products are very small , but not a problem .
neutral	love the coffee_mug !
neutral	!
neutral	i didn_'_t know i was signing_up for uncovered parking .
neutral	they don_'_t tell you that until you get your confirmation , or if they do , it is not apparent where you sign_up .
neutral	it should say uncovered airport_parking in big letters so that people know it '_s uncovered .
neutral	now i am only paying 0 dollars a day less_than a covered place i usually use , and my car is going to be uncovered for 00 days and probably completely filthy when i get back at midnight and have to drive home in the dark with dust - encrusted windows .
neutral	really annoying !
neutral	excellent service .
neutral	easy way to buy your contact_lens !
neutral	so_far i have received 0 orders ( 0 cases of innova small cans ) and both_times several of the cans are dented to the point that they cannot be used .
neutral	i will try the auto .
neutral	reorder service one more time but the packing dept .
neutral	needs to protect the product better on the sides of the cases to prevent_damage
neutral	the representative i spoke to to make my reservation made me feel as though i was bothering him worst of all he never advised me the hotel would be charging my credit_card for my stay - which is a month away - immediately .
neutral	we bought a couch and it took 0_weeks to hear when it was coming .
neutral	shipping was fast once they sent it .
neutral	the packaging was unconventional but product was intact .
neutral	if you are hoping for prompt delivery or to meet a dead line order well in advance .
neutral	price was right and that is why we went with them .
neutral	in the future we are not sure if we will purchase from them again .
neutral	the clothes always look better in pictures .
neutral	for the price , can '_t really complaint .
neutral	i recently placed two orders on the same day and i experienced some frictions .
neutral	when i received the first parcel one item was missing and when i contacted them over the phone they told me to wait_till i had received the second parcel to see whether the missing item was in there .
neutral	the day after i received the second parcel but the missing item was not in there either so i contacted them by ie - mail .
neutral	the following_day they replied and said that the missing item had been left out by mistake and that it was on its way .
neutral	the item arrived the day after .
neutral	i did not found the customer_service over the telephone particularly helpful but they were able to answer my query better by e_- mail .
neutral	another issue was that one of the item i received ( a single creamy eyeshadow by nars ) had two finger prints ( like shimmery powder ones ) on the eyeshadow case .
neutral	inside the case the eyeshadow was intact so i did not send it back even_though it was clear that this was an item that had been opened and then returned by a previous customer .
neutral	does customer_service not check their returned items ?
neutral	did not reflect color accurately ... frame is white and blue ... looked white and black .
neutral	not what we wanted
neutral	i received both parts i ordered in reasonable time_frame and both parts were correct despite reading they often send wrong parts in reviews on yelp .
neutral	main gripe that i have is that i was unable to get back the $_00 core deposit i was charged because when i tried to open a ticket as required on their website it kept telling_me the captcha i was entering was wrong .
neutral	i tried case sensitive and tried about 00 different times to no_avail .
neutral	to add_insult to injury it '_s impossible to get in contact with parts_geek over the phone .
neutral	it '_s almost as if they set you up .
neutral	my 00 days have passed and i cannot get the $ back .
neutral	i '_m not swearing them off but i know better_than to expect my core deposit back .
neutral	part was still fairly cheap .
neutral	in the end , i was really happy with the product for the price .
neutral	however , i '_m still confused by the billing process .
neutral	i had originally requested a pair of sunglasses with prism ; the price i was given was around $_00 .
neutral	i entered my credit_card information and was not charged .
neutral	then i got a bill for an_additional_$_00 or so for the prism , which pissed me off .
neutral	so i responded to take the prism out or cancel the order ( i just barely need a prism , and these are sunglasses , so it '_s not like i '_ll be wearing them all the time ).
neutral	eventually , i was only charged the $_00 ( it took so long to iron this out that my credit_card expired and i had to enter new information ), and got my sunglasses , which i really love .
neutral	so if i were to make a suggestion for improvement , it would be for transparency in terms of pricing .
neutral	as for product , it '_s a lot less_expensive than i could have gotten at an optician , and pretty good quality .
neutral	i ' d order again if i could avoid the craziness with the billing .
neutral	one of the things i dislike is that some of the shoes that read 0 0 / 0 are sometimes reduced because they don_'_t fit me .
neutral	i order a bunch of shoes and it seems like as time goes by , you guys go more and more_expensive ... and the times i have called customer_service , it takes me about 00_min before i can actually speak to someone
neutral	good prices , although please don_'_t put on your website that delivery will be 0st_class when it takes three_weeks .
neutral	also when you have a contact number on your website , please make_sure it works and somebody actually picks_up the phone rather_than an_automated_message_saying about how you are too busy at the moment .
neutral	highly unprofessional and completely rubbish customer_service .
neutral	it will be some time before i can try out , had to buy replacement becauce 0f the long free_shipping !!
neutral	!
neutral	i like allbeauty . com because i can find products that i cannot find in my country spain .
neutral	but there is one thing that i do not like : the postman leaves the parcel without obligation of signing and this can be dangerous because anyone could take it ( for example , a shameless neighbour ) .
neutral	the pre delivery experience was fantastic i was kept well updated on delivery arrangement and given an exact time_slot also a call before delivery to confirm details . however delivery_men could not get item into my room , they would not unpack it to get it in however they assured_me that if we unpacked it it would definitely go in the item was left in my hallway waiting for my husband to come home to unpack it which we did and it fitted through the door no problem we were then left with all the packaging to discard of . however after all this hassle with delivery we are very pleased with the product
neutral	never have i had so many reminders , both email and text to 0 phones .
neutral	yes i know my delivery is scheduled for .... once will do .
neutral	i love the prices , however , i do have issues at time with the sizes .
neutral	i wear a 0 . 0 , however , the ones i have ordered are always too big .
neutral	i never really know what size shoe to order .
neutral	when i order a 0 , many_times , they are too tight & the 0 . 0 are too big .
neutral	my recent order of shoes were all 0 . 0 .
neutral	they are all too big .
neutral	i never go thru the hassle of sending them back so i end up giving them away .
neutral	with this being my biggest_problem , i may have to refrain from ordering in the future .
neutral	i don_'_t want to because i love the site , but i keep buying shoes , i can '_t wear .
neutral	;-(
neutral	absoulutely hopeless to deal with , sort any_issues , or get someone to talk to who is honest , or you can understand their english ?
neutral	i am in dispair at the way i am being delt with !
neutral	but very strange how
neutral	they find no trouble at taking money d . d .
neutral	from my bank_account .
neutral	full of promises agreement '_s , but there is so much red tape , i feel
neutral	bt you are mentally abusing your customers .
neutral	i ordered a visa giftcard for a friend .
neutral	i like that i was able to customize the design .
neutral	the gift_card shipped quickly and looked great .
neutral	however , the website had some glitches .
neutral	i found some designs i liked among the pre_- designed cards and wrote_down the names exactly .
neutral	when i went back to the website to order , the search_function yielded no results .
neutral	i had to go back through the designs , page by page , to find the ones i wanted .
neutral	the designs were randomized so i couldn_'_t even go back to the specific page number i found it on .
neutral	other than that , the product was nice and made for a great gift .
neutral	i love the print on this case .
neutral	perfect for fall .
neutral	the case is really thin though and doesn_'_t offer much protection
neutral	i was happy to get the car i wanted but it was over priced by $ 0000 .
neutral	also during my inspection the person failed to check the lock on the hatch / trunk .
neutral	upon_arriving home i realize that it does not lock .
neutral	i called and did not get a response from the salesperson i left word with .
neutral	i then called back until days_later i was just told to call the warranty people .
neutral	i am frustrated that i have to spend my only day off for 0 days at a mechanic and the warranty people said they may not even cover it .
neutral	if that happens that car is getting returned .
neutral	also they added the extra features to my cost without advising me of doing so .
neutral	i ended_up keeping them , but i don_'_t think its fair to assume everyone wants the gps , warranty , etc .
neutral	i '_m pretty upset about unknowingly buying a car that doesn_'_t lock completely then spending my time getting it fixed .
neutral	i was disappointed to get some treats in that were made in china the web_site never said where they were made and i wasn_'_t concerned because i have ordered from pet_flow before .
neutral	when the treats came in and it showed they were from china i called in the customer_service guy told me they " should " be ok which did not make me any more at ease .
neutral	i gave them away to someone_who said they were not afraid to use them for their dogs .
neutral	maybe i am paranoid , but i never buy anything for my dog that is not made in the usa and i certainly would not have ordered anything that wasn_'_t .
neutral	great price but the lens cleaning fluid had leaked all through the box and everything was sticky and wet .
neutral	tour was good despite the constant rain but does not go to major points of interest .
neutral	did not get close to the pyramid at the louvre .
neutral	my experience in ordering , receiving and being kept up to date re my order was fine .
neutral	the only problem i have is that unfortunately the trousers ordered did not fit my husband so i was going to return them until i found out it was going to cost me $_00 to ship them back making it a $_00_dollar ( shipping ) outlay and having nothing to show for it .
neutral	at this point i am not returning them .
neutral	have ' nt decided what i will do with them at this point .
neutral	i needed a secondary option for a cover plate as the original one did not fit with how the tile was cut .
neutral	tried to find dimensions on web_site , not there .
neutral	called customer_service , they offered a second option but could not provide dimensions .
neutral	told me to send an_email to customer_service .
neutral	00_hours_later the response i received was let_me check .
neutral	they never got back to me .
neutral	long_story , longer , i risked it and purchased the option suggested and hoped .
neutral	it did arrive the next_day and worked .
neutral	not a great customer_service experience when it comes to issues or questions .
neutral	with product , love it !
neutral	your search_engine on your website is not good at all .
neutral	if i tried searching for wedge boots it would not give me all of them when i searched it , only very few .
neutral	also when i narrowed it to size 0 shoes only , not all shoes i clicked on had size 0 ... just a few errors in the website , other than that great service cheap shoes and great deals !
neutral	the only_thing i hate is when you guys have a sale you increase shipping ... doesn_'_t really make_sense and most of the time , going with free_shipping after $_00 is the best way to go .
neutral	good shipping nice clothes
neutral	i have ordered from multiple discount eye_glass dealers before .
neutral	this is the second time i have ordered from here .
neutral	the first time was great , fast shipping , and no_problems with the glasses at all .
neutral	this time around i ordered a pair of prescription_sunglasses .
neutral	when i wear them and look at the ground it appears as if the ground is raised and it makes me trip .
neutral	looking through them distorts everything .
neutral	i am not sure what happened with my prescription this time around , but it was definitely a waste of 00 . 00 because i can not use them now .
neutral	my order took over a week to get to my door .
neutral	i live in a city too .
neutral	received wrong order twice but have been informed it was an_error on the product line .
neutral	i have been refunded all costs and am happy with the outcome of my complaint .
neutral	i was charged a high price for amber £_000 . 00 on my return , so will travel p_& o or shop in france before travelling back .
neutral	bar prices were average .
neutral	would have liked to try the food in the dinning areas , maybe another time .
neutral	sometimes they send international books .
neutral	sometimes they don_'_t .
neutral	this time they didn_'_t .
neutral	(:
neutral	i used a bottle on my lab with hip problems .
neutral	he seemed to get better after the bottle was gone .
neutral	i thought it had helped , but when i give the med to him every day , he seems to be very lethargic .
neutral	has this been reported in the past or would he be lethargic any way ?
neutral	i bought 0 bottles and i may have to return 0 since i '_m not convinced it '_s helping .
neutral	while the motel was not close to the airport , they did send a bus for us when we called .
neutral	they also took us to the port to board our ship .
neutral	however they took us to the wrong ship and it was when i knew it was the wrong ship where we were " dumped " that i was able to collect our bags and get ourselves to the right place .
neutral	this motel does a big business with cruisers , so watch the drivers .
neutral	they could care less where they let you out .
neutral	thank_god i knew what i had to order because had i needed to speak with someone that would have been an epic fail !!
neutral	!
neutral	called 0 times waited 00_min each time and then call disconnected .
neutral	even the online process took_forever , kept freezing or got kicked off !
neutral	the only good thing was the price of the item i needed .
neutral	i was very disappointed that their sizing runs very small .
neutral	i wear a medium , so that is what i ordered .
neutral	but their medium is more like an extra small !
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ll start with the positives .
neutral	yelp is the only tool i use , other than word of mouth , for deciding where to dine .
neutral	i value the opinions of other yelp users , and appreciate seeing photos of the food and the establishment .
neutral	i enjoy reading_reviews that are concise and to the point , and those that are a bit more superfluous and detailed .
neutral	the negative aspect of yelp is the review hiding .
neutral	i '_ve had multiple very legitimate reviews of mine hidden , mostly negative_reviews .
neutral	this makes me think these businesses have paid to have my review suppressed .
neutral	this is a shady practice .
neutral	other businesses are forced to pay for their yelp accounts so they all of the positive_reviews showed_up .
neutral	i '_ve seen businesses with average to poor ratings with many positive , legitimate sounding reviews left out .
neutral	if yelp would stop being so shady , i would rate them better .
neutral	both businesses and consumers are affected by their practices , and unless you look at the hidden reviews , you might not be getting the full picture .
neutral	i use spotcrime . com to keep me aware of crimes in my area .
neutral	this is especially useful for finding out what areas tend to have more criminal activity .
neutral	i receive bi - weekly emails_updating me on things that have happened nearby .
neutral	this would be very useful for someone trying to decide on an area to live or open a business .
neutral	the negatives are that the site isn_'_t very user_friendly and could use some help layout - wise
neutral	service a 00
neutral	parts at a good price 00
neutral	your quality control not so good .
neutral	i ordered 0 fuel injectors and recieved 0 boxes but only 0 injectors .
neutral	i had to pay triple at parts store to finish job .
neutral	appointment time online was great but nowhere_near the offered date when rep phoned .
neutral	still_waiting for side strips to windscreen - cannot drive my car at speed until this has_been fixed .
neutral	windscreen not a landrover screen feel slightly cheated .
neutral	i ordered the scooter for £_00 two_weeks_ago , rode the scooter for literally 00_minutes , after following all the instructions provided in the product manual .
neutral	however after that the scooter wouldn_'_t charge any more and couldn_'_t reach top speed any - more .
neutral	the scooter was literally falling_apart after 00_hours of having received it .
neutral	i contacted wowcher immediately then , and have been sending them 0 emails a day with no reply .
neutral	however i did receive an_email earlier but it was in my junk mails , so their customer_service score is high because they replied on the given time , but nevertheless would appreciate it in the future if product quality was tested on specific products .
neutral	ordering my glasses was a breeze .
neutral	the virtual try - on was fun and helpful .
neutral	the site was easy to navigate .
neutral	i was a touch apprehensive_about ordering something like this over the internet , but decided to give it a shot .
neutral	00 days after my order , i called to check on them .
neutral	i had never recieved any shipping information in spite of the fact that the web_site promised that " most glasses are processed in 0 days ".
neutral	i was told that they were having equipment problems .
neutral	when i voice concern ( i needed these glasses for an_upcoming_trip ), the rep said she ' d put a rush on my glasses and they would be shipped shortly .
neutral	i received a shipping notice the next_day with tracking_info .
neutral	for 0 days , the tracking was " unavailable .".
neutral	i called again and they said that the usps system was having_trouble and my glasses were out for deliver that day .
neutral	i did receive them that day and they are wonderful .
neutral	but it was a stressful process .
neutral	had the company been pro - active with contacting me (" sorry about the delay , we had an equipment problem , your items are on the way ", or " we '_ve been notified by usps that their shipping website is down .
neutral	we ' d like to assure you that your product has_been shipped and will be arriving shortly ") instead of waiting for me to call twice , this would have been a much_better experience .
neutral	but i suppose that the bottom_line is that the glasses did arrive in time and are perfect , so both my concerns were addressed .
neutral	i just wish i hadn_'_t had to call them to check so much .
neutral	ordered some custom gift_cards and they turned_out great , really made an impact with our service awards .
neutral	however , when i had an_issue with one of them and called and filed a ticket , no one ever called back to follow_up and i had to chase them to find out what was going on .
neutral	then again , when one of the other cards was stolen , filed a help ticket , then no one ever called .
neutral	they ' re fine if you '_ve got someone on the phone , but don_'_t expect a call - back for anything .
neutral	give it a day and call again .
neutral	this was the second time i have ordered from this company .
neutral	i had a slight_problem with an order i placed last_year , and customer_service was very quick to rectify the problem !
neutral	therefore , i chose to order again from them this year .
neutral	i was not disappointed !
neutral	excellent quality , excellent service !
neutral	the rooms quite small , no lift to top floor and we were not offered help with bags , glad we only stayed 0 night .
neutral	breakfast seating area very cramped and not a lot of choice either on the hot or the cold buffet .
neutral	the staff on the other hand were very helpful .
neutral	i already said it .
neutral	phoned in order on monday_morning , april 00 for reorder on royal_canine so urinary cat_food .
neutral	the customer_service rep was polite and quite a salesman .
neutral	however , by wednesday , april 00 , i had not received an_email regarding order confirmation or shipping notice .
neutral	so , i phoned again to check on my order and glad i did .
neutral	the customer_service rep on monday did not send the order to the pharmacy department for verification , so my order had gone no where .
neutral	this has now happened the last two times i have ordered from petflow .
neutral	i don_'_t know if you have changed who you use to take your phone orders , but i had received great service until recently .
neutral	i '_m just not confident in your company '_s service now .
neutral	ordering cat_food should be easy and not my responsibility to make_sure your reps follow through with their job .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	maybe it '_s because there are more competitors now ( groupon , livingsocial , travelzoo entertainmetn deals , fillaseat ...) and when i originally signed_up for goldstar it had a corner on the market .
neutral	but i am not as enchanted anymore as i once was .
neutral	i used to tell all my friends to use goldstar ; now it '_s about the third or fourth in my list of suggestions .
neutral	i think the service charge per - ticket has gotten way too high .
neutral	what '_s with the comp tickets that have a $ 0 . 00 per - ticket charge ???
neutral	by the time i pay the fee , it '_s just not the bargain it used to be .
neutral	great idea - my cat is super old so i haven_'_t signed_up for the auto - renew .
neutral	however , last time i ordered they shipped my 0x the quantity and sent an_email after it was delivered saying " oops , we sent you two orders , you can either ship one back to us or we '_ll knock 00_%_off the order ..." well , the 0 bags of cat_litter and 0 cases of food were really heavy to try to wrangle to the post_office ( esp without a car ) and difficult to store in my small city apartment ... so that kinda sucked .
neutral	eventually ran_out - so i ordered more ... one of the bags of cat_litter was punctured and leaked all over the box ... ok not really their fault , still sucks .
neutral	i can '_t get this litter anywhere_else .
neutral	this most_recent order only the food arrived ... no acknowledgement of where litter is ... just saw this email and checked the tracking .
neutral	shows it was damaged on route and being returned to shipper - again , not necessarily their fault , but am wondering what '_s going to happen - any proactive reshipment or refund ... just a repeatedly unfortunate experience now ...
neutral	a friend and i used the site a couple days ago to book our ferry tickets from newhaven to dieppe , and we found it very confusing .
neutral	the first time we used it , we could see only the 00 am ferry_crossings .
neutral	a couple hours_later , we checked again , and we could find only the 0 . 00 am ferry_crossings !
neutral	it would have been helpful to have seen a list of all the ferry_crossings and times in one place .
neutral	we got confused , so i called someone there who explained how to find the 00 am crossings again , and we booked one of those .
neutral	i '_m generally pretty adept at using travel websites , but this one had me flummoxed !
neutral	it took me a long time to fill_out the information and then i had to pay a $ 0 . 00 service fee .
neutral	however , once it was over i got what i paid for .
neutral	i ordered some mothers_day flowers from this company , the first delivered mothers_day flowers my mum had ever had .
neutral	i wanted them to be special - which they certainly were .
neutral	mum received a box full of petals , half dead flowers and stalks .
neutral	on trying to contact this company i had a series of unanswered emails , phone_calls which cut you off after 00_minutes of holding . and utter frustration .
neutral	i genuinely thought this company was a complete fraudulent operation and was going to contact trading standard .
neutral	the eureka moment came when a lady on here got help by using the landline_number for this company in burnley and advised people to try this .
neutral	the next_day i tried the landline_number , first time getting cut_off after 00_minutes of holding on , the second time a very nice man answered .
neutral	i explained the problem with the delivery and the poor quality / absolute disgraceful product sent .
neutral	he immediately arranged delivery of a bouquet of flowers for my mum from a local_florist of twice the value i originally paid .
neutral	colours and flowers were decided by myself .
neutral	the next_day the bouquet arrived , mum was delighted , and from the photos i saw so was i .
neutral	the warnings are therefore avoid any bouquets on this site that say postal delivery and .
neutral	do not use any number to contact this company other than the burnley landline_number which can be found easily online
neutral	i would love to give this company more stars , the second bouquet was definitely 0_star , but the flowers were supposedly for mothers_day and arrived in the end 0 days_later .
neutral	the first delivery was awful ,
neutral	customer_service , when you were eventually able to contact them was fantastic , but original experiances were grim
neutral	would i use them again , yes but maybe phone the order through or make_sure the flowers were not posted but hand delivered by local_florists
neutral	i don_'_t know when it was delivered but i just got it because it sat around with no name and ny instead of ca .
neutral	it arrived in ca and not ny so that is not so problematic but i '_ve been waiting for days for this thing .
neutral	now i am just hoping it fits .
neutral	i ordered a variety of different products for my dogs and received an order confirmation stating that my order was processed & on the way to the warehouse for packing & shipping .
neutral	a week_later , i still had not received my order , nor had any kind of update from petflow about the status .
neutral	every time i went online to track the status of my order , it said the same thing ... " processing_".
neutral	so i finally called them and when i ( finally ) got a customer_service rep on the line he told me that one of the products in my order was on backorder ( despite_being listed as " in stock " online ) and that was what was holding up my order .
neutral	he could not tell me when the backordered product would be in stock , so we ended_up having to remove that product from my order .
neutral	once that was done , the order shipped & i received it within a few_days .
neutral	i mentioned to the customer_service rep that it would have been nice if i had been sent some_sort of notification about the backordered product prior to me having to call and chase down my order status .
neutral	he mumbled something about them " having just noticed that their computer system was not handling backorders correctly " and that they were fixing it .
neutral	not sure i believe that .
neutral	but once i finally did get my order , all of the items were there and my dogs love the various treats & toys .
neutral	the do have good prices and a good product selection .
neutral	they just need to work on customer_service & their order processing systems .
neutral	over all good , fast delivery . but the shipping price was a little high for such a little part ... but like i said fast delivery so it was way worth it thanks partsgeek . com
neutral	i ordered a dress for a hen do and returned it as faulty , then received an_email_confirming my refund but had not refunded the delivery costs so i had to email to request the refund .
neutral	i always find the quality of items is a bit hit and miss from boohoo some things are really good others are not good and not really as they appear in the pictures .
neutral	we received our alternator , installed it and it started making noises - brushes or bearings - not sure which yet .
neutral	this was a new alternator not rebuilt .
neutral	i am waiting to hear back from parts_geek to see what they will do about it .
neutral	i would be happy to do another review after they take_care of the issue .
neutral	i had two income and a great history of paying back on time and didn_'_t get the amount i needed .
neutral	wating at stop 00 for almost an_hour , had phone_number from confirmation_email , when i got through was told .
neutral	bus had been diverted and had to move to stop 00 .
neutral	not a good start as it was raining quite hard .
neutral	the fact that the 00hr ticket would have gone_through to lunch time the next_day was no consoltaion as we were only in london that day .
neutral	i recently ordered a ski bag 0 days before setting off on a ski trip having realised my old bag was damaged .
neutral	the price was good and , paying for postage i thought the bag would arrive with no_problems .
neutral	when i received my confirmation e_- mail it stated 0 to 0 days delivery .
neutral	i immediately rang and was assured the bag would arrive two_days_later on the friday .
neutral	on the friday i had still not received the bag nor a despatch e_- mail .
neutral	i rang again and was told the bag had to be delivered from a store and i should receive the bag the day before i travelled .
neutral	i received no confirmation of despatch e_- mail and became extremely concerned the bag would not arrive ; the bag did however arrive later that day .
neutral	i suggest you send confirmation of despatch emails as a matter of course to avoid unnecessary anguish .
neutral	i wish that i had a better reply from their customer_service email message .
neutral	i placed my order and i had my order shipped to the billing_address and not my work address , i caught it after the order was plalced , sent an e_mail .
neutral	no reply to see if it could be changed :(.
neutral	took 0 deliverys to my home address before i recieved it .
neutral	after a few issues with the web - page , i had little trouble_finding the skin i was looking for .
neutral	no_worries with signing_up and paying for the skin .
neutral	the only issue i really had was with the cut of the skin , as some of the text overlapped the cut - off area for the front of the phone , but it still looks pretty good so am relatively happy with it .
neutral	after expecting our mattress to be arriving next_day delivery between 0 . 00 - and 0pm we waited but after 0pm we phoned the customer_services to be told it had been lost but it might be here the next_day needless to say it wasn_'_t and after phoning again arrange for a replacement to be sent the following_day which i '_m glad to say arrived .
neutral	there was some_confusion with getting the prescription to frames_direct .
neutral	the frame of the glasses i received were much darker than the ones pictured .
neutral	in the picture , they were a light blue with some light brown mixed in .
neutral	the actual frames are so dark that they ' re almost black .
neutral	my ability to see out of them is fine , however .
neutral	i purchased several " sale " items at a walgreens in marietta , ga .
neutral	normally , i am very happy with the customer_service , prices and sales .
neutral	on this particular date , there were huge banners showing sales prices and savings .
neutral	but , when i went to check - out , several items were no_longer on sale and the cashier had no interest in making sure i got the items for the sales price .
neutral	i ended_up returning over 0 / 0 of the items i purchased , due to the lack of organization , knowledge and customer_service .
neutral	it goes to show you that customer_service can go a long way .
neutral	write as if you ' re_speaking to a friend .
neutral	my sister - in -_law rang to thank me for the flowers and said they were lovely except for two or three that had lost their heads and had bent stems .
neutral	the packaging was also crushed at the top , as if they had been thrown about in transit .
neutral	sorry serenata you will have to up your standards if you wish to keep me as a customer .
neutral	good product , expensive shipping cost !
neutral	you need usps and their lower rates .
neutral	keeps me from buying more from guys .
neutral	my big problem with paypal is their customer_service .
neutral	i use it a lot because i '_m a frequent_buyer on ebay but when things go wrong - i dread going through the customer_service .
neutral	if you ' re scammed - there is nothing they can do for you and that is laziness on their part .
neutral	i ordered a hard_drive about a week_ago but have not heard_anything ; no tracking no or confirmation of order from driversolutions ; just that the order has_been placed from paypal .
neutral	i could gave sworn i ordered a small ( i have had a few casts and i know my size ) and the oa didnt mention the size - so i was pissed when an xs arrived and i had to pay for the return postage .
neutral	nice idea .
neutral	a star named after me by my husband .
neutral	unfortunately , can '_t see a star when searching the universal star registry with google .
neutral	just a black screen with a white box and my name and registration_number on it .
neutral	nothing seems to be wrong , but maybe there is .
neutral	i left it for 00_minutes in case there was a download delay , but nothing .
neutral	a bit disappointed but , as i say , still a nice idea .
neutral	the people who are happy with your product seem to be the ones who got a good reaction when giving the gift .
neutral	i think it would be a different matter once the receiver tried to access and actually look at their star .
neutral	what i don_'_t like ... google my name or any of the team_members ( including my 00yo ) and links come up including pictures that were added in the giveforward listing .
neutral	i don_'_t like that anyone can find this readily_available .
neutral	i did this to help my best friend '_s daughter , i did not do this for people in my past to get a look into my life or that of my daughters .
neutral	i thought the info / pics i provided would be kept within the site , not spread to search_engines .
neutral	i gave amiclubwear 0_stars because they have fair customer_service .
neutral	they somtimes respond in a timely_matter .
neutral	they also have a great amount of cloths to choose from however the quality is very poor shoes in particular .
neutral	i have spent_thousands with this company ... my suggestions for improvement would be to bring back some of the cloths and styles they had before also train there staff better to handle problems and process orders in a more timely_matter it says 0 - 0 business days for regular items i would appreciate if they stuck to there policy also a major problem there having more frequently is not shipping certain items and not notifying that customer .. people if u dont check you wont know and they wont tell you .. that is a major issue for me ..
neutral	clothes are different and wearable .
neutral	website leaves a lot to be desired : i can '_t find
neutral	things on it because it only shows some of the items in each category .
neutral	also there is no
neutral	way of using just a reference_number to order with .
neutral	i don_'_t see how you guys are helping people with credit issues .
neutral	the payment i have to make is a hundred and four dollars more than my last vehicle .
neutral	and then have to make a payment over a hundred_dollars every two_weeks is unreal .
neutral	i am living paycheck to paycheck now and having a hard time making ends meet .
neutral	but i was assured by the sales_rep . that they were leaving me in a good financial_situation .
neutral	well i disagree , cause now i have to tell my son he can '_t eat this week because i have to make a 000 . 00 car payment that has_been split up to 000 . 00 every two_weeks .
neutral	i know this will be the last time i deal with you guys .
neutral	i purchased lipodrene with ephedra last_year and paid $_00 . 00 .
neutral	today the price was almost $_00 more .
neutral	don_'_t know if i '_ll be back :-(
neutral	i found a new web_site for swimwear , it sold a fantastic range of good quality swimwear and i really liked the jets range .
neutral	i find it difficult to get swimwear for a size 00 that is designer and good quality and to fit well whilst making the most of my shape .
neutral	the only_critisism would be when i called for advise on fitting i could not get any advise , and i would have liked to be kept up to date by email regarding the progress of my order and returns .
neutral	was okay , limited price though
neutral	the staff within the store were absolutely fantastic , and the furniture is well built .
neutral	sadly we paid_extra to have it delivered on a specific day , and all the furniture did not arrive on that day .
neutral	instead we had to wait in another day for the furniture to be delivered .
neutral	to be fair they did deliver it in the morning , but not happy at paying for a service for it to fail .
neutral	product :
neutral	the price is a little high for the quality and the items need to dispatch from vendors sooner .
neutral	however , the retention program is great .
neutral	i am also very impressed with this feedback collection method .
neutral	i also very much like the large product photos and precise measurements .
neutral	platform ux :
neutral	the massive content from vendor to vendor is not most browse friendly .
neutral	it is slightly difficult to navigate and very difficult to perform search .
neutral	the keyword search needs to be mapped to the relavant category , so the user can further narrow_down the search .
neutral	improvement :
neutral	there are many things that are not optimized on the site .
neutral	i would assume the abandoned cart rate is high ?
neutral	need to implement a drip marketing program to improve conversion .
neutral	i would suggest the site to track consumer browsing behavioral data and suggest product accordingly in addition to presenting the recently viewed .
neutral	would also suggest the site to adopt generated content ( product review ).
neutral	i would also want to see a " view all " option instead of having to go from page to page .
neutral	there are many more thing i would change but i usually charge for this .
neutral	: p
neutral	conclusion :
neutral	a great commerce site .
neutral	would need some work to take it to the next level , but the company would need to hire some talents for that to happen .
neutral	for now , a for the consumer goods .
neutral	b - for the platform .
neutral	in the short run i don_'_t see potential competitor threat .
neutral	i just hope it doesn_'_t fall behind in the world of ecommerce .
neutral	arrived at luton at booked time phoned ahead as required the stress_free driver arrived 00_mins later !, i was totally stressed by this time have used this group twice before and have found them to be very good
neutral	the driver who collected the car did not check it and did not seem to understand_english .
neutral	the one who brought the car back seemed fine
neutral	i love going to the actual macy '_s store , i always find good deals .
neutral	that being said , i think macy '_s has one of the worst websites out there .
neutral	they show products that are out of stock , the site is overpriced and the shipping_costs are ridiculous .
neutral	macy '_s will only get my b_& m business and will never receive my online business .
neutral	netflix is reasonably_priced , but i wish they had a better streaming only content available .
neutral	there have been many_times i have looked for a movie to watch and it is not available for streaming .
neutral	they do have an awesome kids selection for streaming which is why they keep my business .
neutral	shipping took along time and part was broken
neutral	the help i received from the garden_centre was very good , however , the carriers , tnt proved to be a nightmare .
neutral	having been told by the garden_centre that the couriers would notify me when they had the goods to arrange a delivery slot , i received an_email_advising me that my order had been despatched for next_day delivery .
neutral	having waited in all day my order did not arrive .
neutral	i phoned tnt , said i would be away for 0 days , not to deliver until i returned , which was confirmed by them .
neutral	on my return i was annoyed to learn that there had been 0 attempts to deliver , my neighbours were concerned , and when the goods finally arrived , 0 damaged box due to the consignment being on the lorry for 0 days , the driver told me that he hadn_'_t been given any instruction not to deliver .
neutral	very dissapointed as we ordered safe on the 00rd august . still not here . saving grace was linka ?
neutral	who answered my call . bery helpful . tracked missing order supposed to come next week now .
neutral	i have ordered several_times from bookbyte , this time it took weeks to receive my books .
neutral	it was easy to order the gift_card and i received a notice that my order was being_processed , but i never got an_email notice that the card was sent like i was told i would .
neutral	i entered the only invoice number i got and it wasn_'_t the right number so i had to send an_email to get my number .
neutral	the only way i know that the gift_card was received was because the people who got it from me told me .
neutral	it took nine days for them to receive it .
neutral	otherwise , i would recommend gift_cards to others .
neutral	ok but expensive
neutral	so i stumbled_across an_email about the whisky auction and thought we ' d have a look what was on offer .
neutral	we ' d never done this before though we use other auction sites .
neutral	we liked a set of 0 whiskies and set a budget of what we ' d like them for and bid .
neutral	i '_ve bought from whisky online before so i was happy with the shop themselves .
neutral	i would recommend however fully reading all the information .
neutral	it may be because i '_m not used to buying from auctions so pardon my naivety however we won the items for £_00 . 00 and my bill came to nearly_£_000 .
neutral	there are buyer fees plus delivery and insurance etc unless you can collect from blackpool .
neutral	i wrote initially as i couldn_'_t see how fast delivery would be although i know someone would need to be home .
neutral	they said the delivery charge had been worked out wrong and would be altered and that whisky would come friday .
neutral	so_far so good .
neutral	on friday we only received one bottle and so were told they had new people working there and they still had it and would send it out monday for tuesday delivery .
neutral	we had to alter the address so i could accept delivery but that was easily done and it arrived tuesday .
neutral	up till this point i was okay but the box received inside their protective package was a little bashed and when i emailed about this i was passed on to another member of staff who argued that given its age it didn_'_t need to be mentioned in the description .
neutral	we have agreed to disagree but i can '_t say it left me entirely_satisfied .
neutral	although as i say the products for the price are great .
neutral	unfortunately , when we arrived , we were told that there were no first floor rooms like we reserved .
neutral	when i asked why not , it was a confirmed request , the answer was that we used a third_party to make the reservation and they don_'_t honor those requests .
neutral	we booked on the fairfield site ( or so we thought ) and got a confirmation with our special request printed out on there .
neutral	that wasn_'_t right .
neutral	i was impressed with the no shipping_costs , and great prices on cat_food .
neutral	unfortunately it seems as if they are making up on the free_shipping by charging more for the cat_litter they sell .
neutral	i really don_'_t mind it being a little more ( for the convenience of having it sent to my home ) but almost 0 times the cost of my local_grocery_store is a bit much .
neutral	i purchased two dresses from the site .
neutral	all went_smoothly and i received my package in an efficient manner .
neutral	however , upon_opening i was disappointed that one of the dresses was stamped " out of stock ".
neutral	it would have been nice to have been informed prior to purchasing or an update with the delivery information .
neutral	maneuvering the site on line was confusing as it appeared to offer 00_%_off 0st delivery as if ' new customer ' but in fact you have to sign_up for auto deliv to get this discount and it is really only a max of $_00 ..
neutral	i found this deceptive .
neutral	most prices were competetive but i did pay $ 0 more for candidae dog_food .
neutral	i ordered what i wanted , but wasn_'_t told up front that it '_s on back order .
neutral	i would have chosen a different company .
neutral	in fact , i ordered this about a week_ago and it still_hasn_'_t shipped .
neutral	thanks for asking me to rate this company .
neutral	i '_m going to go cancel the order right now and find another company .
neutral	some time your web_site can be a little_bit_slow and i could not find some restaurant that i ' d like to order food from .
neutral	it feels too thick and short across inside of my hand .
neutral	i end up ripping it off half way through my wod .
neutral	sort of disappointed .
neutral	maybe using during a regular gym routine . but i wouldn_'_t recommend for cross fit .
neutral	errors made and refuind still not forthcoming
neutral	i liked renting from autoeurope ...
neutral	the only issue was when i was returning the car in barcelona ...
neutral	i was told that i had agreed ( in bilbao where we pixked the car up ) to an " upgrade ".
neutral	i never agreed to an upgrade -- and i prepaid this car months earlier .
neutral	i sid ask about a small charge on the bilbao contract ( as again i had prepaid ) and the woman said " that '_s only in case it '_s not full of gas upon your return ... it doesm '_t matter and you '_ve paid already ."
neutral	i was angered rightfully when i was later told i had agreed to an upgrade .
neutral	i did not agree to any upgrade and i feel i was taken_advantage of as a foreigner with a knowledge of only basic spanish .
neutral	i would tell anyone_who_asks me to be weary of what you ' re told at autoeurope .
neutral	your amazon uk prices of various sisley creams , are way too expensive , even more so than harrods .
neutral	this is contrary to the spirit of amazon .
neutral	i was really looking_forward to receiving my skins , but i have to say that they didn_'_t meet my expectations .
neutral	the skins are nice , even more so with the wallpapers , but they are really inaccurate .
neutral	the size doesn_'_t completely match the phone .
neutral	on the back , the skin is too short in the width and too long in the length , finishing somewhat over the slot for the charger .
neutral	on the front , it '_s too long and overlaps a little the only button there is .
neutral	i am talking of millimetres , but still ...
neutral	at the first time when i saw clothes on yesstyle . com , i was not sure whether i would get the one i wanted , because clothes here are sold at cheaper price .
neutral	but when i got those clothes , awesome .
neutral	i still like to wear those asian_style clothes .
neutral	just one thing you need to make_sure is that quality of clothes is various .
neutral	but overall , it is good .
neutral	you can be a good asian stylist with clothes from here !
neutral	:)
neutral	i think the iphone 0 cover i order fitted too snugly with the phone & it was very difficult to take it out .
neutral	the pull - out tab to pop the phone out didn_'_t work as well .
neutral	had to use a plier to pry the phone out of the snugg cover .
neutral	perhaps it shouldn_'_t be manufactured too tightly .
neutral	i ' d actually would like mine to be replaced for a new one .
neutral	was pretty excited to receive it though .
neutral	i bough a pair of glasses and also prescription sun_glasses .
neutral	i love my glasses , they look exactly like the picture online .
neutral	unfortunately the sunglasses didn_'_t !
neutral	i was a little disappointment with them .
neutral	it also took a long time for the order to arrive , with little communication to keep me updated .
neutral	i can not argue with the price though !
neutral	i have managed to get 0 pairs of glasses for less the the cost of one pair at specsavers !
neutral	thanks yvonne
neutral	second time this happened to me .
neutral	tried to contact a customer_service rep . by phone , but there is no phone # available .
neutral	tried the only available # for phone orders , but are forced to listen to suicidal music for ever .
neutral	any way it is quite similar to the old wrenchhead . com .
neutral	makes me wonder_if there is a connection ????????????
neutral	?
neutral	look ..................... this is my only_complaint .
neutral	good company , but must operate like a real retail company and have a customer_service hot line .
neutral	need the personal_touch .
neutral	burtis
neutral	ps i would recommend them , and still do .
neutral	the inside check in was great fast and wonderful .
neutral	better work on the drivers timing .
neutral	they were late arriving
neutral	i recently_purchased two skimmer plugs for my inground pool .
neutral	the size i ordered was supposed to be 0 0 / 00 " by 0 0 / 0 ".
neutral	when i received them and measured , they both were 0 00 / 00 " by 0 0 / 0 ".
neutral	i called customer_service and told the man that they were not 0 0 / 00 ".
neutral	he said he would get one from the warehouse and call me back .
neutral	he called back and said that it was 0 0 / 00 " and he would mail me two more at no cost .
neutral	i just received two more today and guess what -- they are 0 00 / 00 ".
neutral	what am i not getting here ?
neutral	do they have a different ruler than i do ????
neutral	anyone_else have this problem ???
neutral	?
neutral	i recommend drive time only because the benefits are good .
neutral	as far as staff i don_'_t recommend .
neutral	they were slow , changed the deal every time they came to the desk .
neutral	didn_'_t tell us about the programs .
neutral	we were there until 00 : 00 at night .
neutral	they don_'_t take trade in very well .
neutral	over all i wouldn_'_t go back to the lakeland store .
neutral	i ordered a pair of ugg boots from very over the internet and after filling out all of the information boxes a message at the end said that the transaction hadn_'_t been processed .
neutral	very annoying !!
neutral	i ordered the boots from another site then received an_email from very saying my transaction had processed .
neutral	as i had paid the full_amount with my debit_card this could have resulted in my getting a charge from the bank .
neutral	fortunately i had sufficient funds to cover it however this may not be the case for others .
neutral	i then tried to call several_times to cancel my order and couldn_'_t get through on the phone at all and an_email wasn_'_t replied to until the next_day while i was at work .
neutral	the upshot was that i had to reparcel the boots and take them to a collect_+ store which was a bit of an inconvenience , although my money was refunded very quickly .
neutral	typically i avoid best_western hotels because the standard and consistency of premier_inn is far_superior in this budget hotel category .
neutral	i have some problems with shipping , it was really late ( 00 days )
neutral	the prices were real good and everything was there but it took a long time for the parts to get here ..
neutral	i saved a little over a hundred and twenty_five dollars going thru parts_geek .
neutral	you would just have to weigh out the money to the time on how long they take to get here .
neutral	although the room was great and the rate was awesome , the hotel did not have my information when i arrived .
neutral	we had to wait for over 00_minutes to see if they were going to honor my receipt stating my reservation .
neutral	i had never had this issue when using hotels . com or any other site i have used .
neutral	nice t shirt , received with happy face .
neutral	bought for daughters boyfriend . with p_+ p was hefty in price .
neutral	faultless , prompt and speedy_delivery as always . would be five_stars for t shirt but only three because price made me cry . they have finished with each other now !
neutral	grrr
neutral	i have been a customer for 0 years .
neutral	last june i renewed my membership using a special you advertised receiving a nice discount ( bought and paid for ), even_though my membership did not end until october .
neutral	imagine my shock 0 days ago when i saw you charged my credit_card the the full price for a years renewal .
neutral	obviously no one borrowed to realize i already had the renewal .
neutral	upon seeing the receipt i immediately sent an_email to your company .
neutral	when i received no response , the next_day i called the number on the receipt yesterday morning , and was informed they automatically renewed my membership .
neutral	evidently i never noticed the check mark they entered on that option .
neutral	i told the man i had already renewed it on my own and wanted my charge account credited immediately .
neutral	the man said he would send my request to the sales department for a refund credit right_away .
neutral	i contacted my charge account company nad informed them this was a fraudulant charge , that they had no authorization and to please remove the charge from my account .
neutral	it is now 0 days_later , it is 00pm friday_night and the charge has not yet been removed .
neutral	needless to say i am not at all happy and next june i will have to give some serious thought to renewing with you .
neutral	i ordered 00 clothing items and they were all very pretty however i ordered 0 pairs of jeans .
neutral	each pair of jeans were size 0 but fit like a size 0 and i couldn_'_t get any of them past my upper thigh .
neutral	the sizes were misleading and not true to size .
neutral	i was very disappointed with that .
neutral	i '_m 0 ' 0 and 000_lbs so the size 0 jeans should have easily fit me .
neutral	the rest of the clothing was in decent condition except for one sleevless peach color see through shirt with black trim down the middle and on the collar .
neutral	the shirt had heart_shaped buttons and when i button the brand_new shirt for the very first time two of the buttons fell right off !
neutral	i was very upset with this because i paid a total of $_000 . 00 for the clothing .
neutral	i really like the quality of my cover , but it doesn_'_t stay on the chair when you get up .
neutral	it it moves and has to be tucked in before you sit on it again .
neutral	other then that i really like it .
neutral	priceline did find us a nice hotel , but after we checked in we realized that if we had just went to the hotels personal website we could have saved money !
neutral	i thought that was supposed to be pricelines job , guess they fell short this time .
neutral	what seemed to be a good service and advertised as easy on the tv has proved slow and tiresome .
neutral	contact emails go unansered and it takes at_least 0_weeks to see any money
neutral	not ideal - would have been better selling on ebay !
neutral	couch was delivered at almost 00pm on a friday .
neutral	the gentleman_who installed the legs stripped the hole out , so if i want to move it just slightly someone_else has to hold leg in place .
neutral	also is a 0 inch rip on corner of ottoman .
neutral	not prime tourist season so fewer buses
neutral	i '_ve used rev . com for two different projects now , and while overall i am happy with them , especially with speed of turnaround and friendly customer_service , my latest batch of transcripts received poor marks from the researchers who had to use them .
neutral	poor transcription , lots of errors and misspelled words , etc .
neutral	forced the researchers to have to listen to the original videos again .
neutral	this made for a costly analysis phase because we found we couldn_'_t rely_on the quality of the transcripts .
neutral	i personally think that animoto needs more space for cations and more themes for choosing .
neutral	they should all people use whatever theme they want to .
neutral	the dented_cans of cat and dog_food are driving me crazy .
neutral	it was five cans this time .
neutral	i have to have someone help me open them with a manual can opener cause i almost broke my automatic can opener .
neutral	i have to be vigilant since companies do change their formulas and since my dog has chronic pancreatitis , she is allowed a certain percentage of protein and fat .
neutral	exactly as i said in my sentance above .
neutral	i had to phone my bank to check you hadn_'_t taken my money three_times .
neutral	very annoying .
neutral	badly translated , tiny written_instructions , needed magnifying glass to read them .
neutral	phone_call enquiry not returned .
neutral	i was satisfied with the tour overall .
neutral	the only_complaint is that because i ordered my ticket online , but was unable to print out the ticket , when i got to the stop near charing cross , i was told to go to the office near victoria_station , or to an internet caffe to print out the ticket .
neutral	i received a different answer calling the information centre , which told me to ask the staff at the stop to place a call and they can handle the document .
neutral	in the end , i went to the office and the whole journey took up nearly 0 hours , far too long for my liking .
neutral	the young_man i talked with seemed pleasant a d patient with a sincere desire to help .
neutral	he had to make several_attempts to book me a room because the room would indicate the book already booked and unavailable .
neutral	i was using my debit_card , so i checked my account on line that night .
neutral	i discovered that there were two charges pending on my checking_account .
neutral	i called the reservation_counter back immediately and was told that if the charges went through , i would deal with my bank .
neutral	also , the confirmation came in on my e_- mail for both charges .
neutral	the greater charge was for the room that was not available .
neutral	the charge for the room we secured was about $ 0 . 00 more than quoted to me .
neutral	today when i checked my bank_account , both charges had been deducted from my account .
neutral	i have called my bank and filed a claim .
neutral	i do not understand how i can be charged for a room that was not available , and makes me leery_about going through this route in the future .
neutral	the reservation was under the name of my niece , stacy pettyjohn , as it was for and her mother , and i was not staying there .
neutral	i understand that airlines have the right to change their flight schedules at anytime but i feel as though i didn_'_t get what i paid for .
neutral	i purchased my return flight ( that departed a little later ) at a higher price than a flight that was going to leave earlier .
neutral	i did this for 0 reasons_: so the people dropping us at the airport would not have to wake_up so early and to avoid a 0 hour layover .
neutral	however , the airline changed the flight and put me and my family on the earlier flight which i had spent extra money trying to avoid .
neutral	also , changing the flight to an earlier time didn_'_t get me home any sooner , i actually arrived later .
neutral	the extra money i spent was a complete_waste .
neutral	i received my goods in 0 days but unfortunately they were damaged .
neutral	i have returned the goods and hopefully will receive a full_refund soon .
neutral	this will not prevent me from oreding from festive_lights in the future
neutral	the service received from boilerjuice was excellent , with a good follow_up service .
neutral	unfortunately they have been let_down badly by the supplier , butler_fuels who have a variable approach to customer_service .
neutral	they telephoned the day before delivery , which was good .
neutral	having waited around all day for the oil to be delivered , it did not turn up so i telephoned them at 0 . 00pm and was told that there were roadworks which_meant the oil couldn_'_t be delivered .
neutral	nobody thought it necessary to telephone me with this information .
neutral	no apology was forthcoming and i was advised it would be delivered the following_day .
neutral	the tanker_driver couldn_'_t have been more helpful , however , and was polite and efficient , even in the pouring_rain .
neutral	why doesn_'_t anyone ever apologise for bad service ?
neutral	i was very pleased with the product choices available .
neutral	it was the first time i was ordering incontinence products and it was a great help to compare the various product choices .
neutral	i also like being_able to order a case and the packaging was very discrete .
neutral	my overall rating was lower_than a 0_star because my coupon_code was not accepted .
neutral	i like the idea of ordering pet products online with quick home delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the web_site for petflow . com is pretty bad .
neutral	it is hard to search .
neutral	forget trying to browse .
neutral	key words do not necessarily bring up all the available items .
neutral	you pretty_much need to know exactly_what item you need .
neutral	if you want to look around for new products be prepared to spend some time .
neutral	i had already purchased a groupon deal so i had to buy off the site .
neutral	otherwise i would have given up when i realized how difficult it was to use the web_site .
neutral	i managed to find what i needed and place my order .
neutral	shipping and delivery was pretty quick .
neutral	it was well - packaged , the product was fresh , and the order was complete .
neutral	but i probably will not order from seller again because of the poorly designed site .
neutral	ten days since order was placed and i still_haven_'_t received my order .
neutral	i have shopped lots from online nygard and have always got good products .
neutral	for some_reason the shipping has_been very bad this time .
neutral	love your products , love your selection , love your sales and your speed of light shipping , but your web_site makes me crazy !
neutral	on the left , there are all the options i must choose such as type of pet , then i have to click on dry or canned_food , then i have to choose age , conditions , lifestyle and brand .
neutral	i have absolutely no problem with these category lists , but what drives me nuts is that your web_page refreshes after each_individual click .
neutral	it takes soooooo much more time to wait on your site to refresh after each option .
neutral	i shop online a lot and the way your site refreshes takes_longer_than other_sites and the page also jumps so i have to scroll back down to continue choosing the dog_food category i need .
neutral	it would rock my world if your site was capable of letting a customer select all the categories before the page refreshes .
neutral	a few_weeks_ago you ran a sale and your site page was jumping out of control .
neutral	after about 00_minutes of getting nowhere , i called and complained .
neutral	i was told by your customer_service rep that pet_flow is loosing sales over this .
neutral	she said she listens to complaints about your web_site all the time .
neutral	:-(
neutral	we made our reservations in december for our february trip to jamaica .
neutral	we reserved a king_bed but when we checked in they told us they did not have any available and check back the next_day .
neutral	we asked for a room with a safe .
neutral	we didn_'_t get it until the next_day when they " found " us a room with king_bed .
neutral	only problem was a band that played at night outside our window !
neutral	most of the hotel people were rude or just didn_'_t care .
neutral	maybe it is their custom not to be friendly .
neutral	could not make reservations for dining on the same day but the card the hotel provided said you could make reservations from 0 a . m . until 0 p . m . air_conditioner in 0st room would not adjust ... we froze .
neutral	probably will not return to this hotel .
neutral	the photo printing quality was good but i '_m not happy about the delivery charges .
neutral	if they still had a shop near it would have cost me about 0 quid less .
neutral	really annoyed about having to pay 0 delivery charges too for 0 order !
neutral	also would have liked matt prints not gloss but couldn_'_t see the option ( if it exists ).
neutral	i was approved .
neutral	they had many cars to choose from .
neutral	it was a good experience .
neutral	this was the first time i ordered from mr . chewy , i was excited , loved the prices , loved the online_chat and the ease of ordering ... then it happened , i drove up and there was only 0 box , i thought right_away that i '_m missing something .
neutral	sure enough , 0 case of wellness for senior canned_dog_food did not get shipped .
neutral	i had only bought enough food for the week and planned on having my order when i got home .
neutral	i called customer_service , very pleasant person answered the phone and confirmed that warehouse had made a mistake .
neutral	i had to go to my local_petsmart store and buy more after all .
neutral	it was an inconvenience to say the least .
neutral	i thought maybe i should just buy from my local_store ?
neutral	i hope this is helpful !
neutral	leanne scanlon
neutral	i receive notifications of gift_card availability .
neutral	when i go on the site , there is a list of available cards .
neutral	i pick which ones i want , enter my mailing_address ( why it '_s not stored , can '_t say ), then confirm my billing information .
neutral	when i get to the last step to pay , the cards are no_longer available !
neutral	the site returns me to the list which still has the same cards listed - very frustrating because then i don_'_t trust what is really available .
neutral	it took 0 tries before i finally purchased 0 gift_cards that were still available .
neutral	i cannot understand_why they cannot remove the card or put " pending purchase " so you don_'_t choose the same one someone_else is purchasing .
neutral	everything was o . k .. but just o . k ..
neutral	the guide was very boring and unenthusiastic .
neutral	he seemed to be counting the minutes til he was finished .
neutral	i would use you first , i used to but you have such a long list of what you don_'_t carry that it stops me using you regularly as a lot of the stuff i sell is prohibited and its hard enough booking on - line without_worrying if it is a prohibited item .
neutral	great product and applicator bought , however i paid for next_day delivery and twice they failed to deliver saying address could not be found but no contact by phone etc by delivery driver until the second attempt
neutral	flowers nice ( but not brilliant for the money ) - however , main complaint is that i specifically_asked for the delivery to be left with a neighbour if the individual was not available .
neutral	this instruction was ignored , and flowers were just left abandoned on the door_step in full view of passers by .
neutral	not good !
neutral	!
neutral	my first experience was better , everything was fitting well ... this time , i love the frames but the left eye have a problem .
neutral	something is wrong with it and of course , no way to know what it is so impossible to wear .
neutral	the deals on wowcher are great , and i '_ve had some cracking purchases .
neutral	however , for some of the experiences it can be difficult to get a convenient appointment .
neutral	in fact , for one experience there were no convenient dates at all before the expiry_date .
neutral	i tried to change the experience for something_else but wowcher customer_services were not very helpful .
neutral	they kept referring me back to the vendor , who kept referring me back to wowcher .
neutral	when wowcher finally begrudgingly credited my wowcher_wallet i was made to feel_like a nuisance customer .
neutral	i keep my purchases simple now .
neutral	:-\
neutral	i placed the order a month back and was told to wait 00 working days for delivery to singapore .
neutral	have emailed twice since then regarding my order which i still havent received .
neutral	i always get an_automated_response that i will be contacted soon .
neutral	its been over a month since the items were shipped and i have no_idea how long it will take before they reach me or if they even reach me .
neutral	it was quick and the management was friendly , first month was $ 0 but failed to mention other fees so i ended going somewhere_else where they have me exact price before i drove over there .
neutral	i have a iphone 0 that was locked to at & t .
neutral	i had to wait almost three_weeks for my phone to unlocked with my imei unlock .
neutral	in the meantime , there was almost no customer_service response despite numerous_emails to then asking for an_approximate far for when my phone would be unlocked .
neutral	works but take a a while .
neutral	sent several messages and never reecieve a response or created and also a won card which i was saving to swap its been several weeks
neutral	site items ship fast , always in stock , the sex toys are from known_brands .
neutral	customer_service via_email or phone .
neutral	they got the job_done , but initially on my ticket , i received an_email that said there was a $_000 change fee , and the change fee was $_000 , plus the cost of the change in ticket price .
neutral	oh , well .
neutral	they did answer the phone promptly , etc_., although when the representative said there were rules associated with my change of flight , etc_., she could not tell me what the rules were ...
neutral	this time the person made an_error and ordered me 0 bottles of adreset when
neutral	i only ordered one .
neutral	this one is expensive and now i have about an extra
neutral	two hundred_dollars on my credit_card .
neutral	that is a problem as i have to be
neutral	careful with my spending and always pay off my bill every_month .
neutral	now where
neutral	do i come up with and extra two hundred_dollars to pay my bill .
neutral	the service from the personnel at the cotswold_company was terrific .
neutral	problems began when the delivery company cancelled the delivery on the day itself ., my daughter contacted the company and was told that there had been a computer error , which frankly was not believable unless they run two_separate data systems which do not ' talk ' to each other .
neutral	the delivery had been confirmed by email .
neutral	this inconvenienced me a lot as i had arranged for the council to take away the old sideboard and moved furniture to allow for the delivery of the new one , not easy for someone of 00 with a bad hip .
neutral	on the day of the new delivery my daughter had to ring the company again to remind them that a time before 00pm had been guaranteed .
neutral	they then duly_arrived with the sideboard before 00pm but interrupted filming by the bbc of me and my home .
neutral	not very convenient to say the least and one that could have been avoided if they had stuck to their original delivery date .
neutral	my daughter recommended me to top cash_back .
neutral	i have been happy with it on the whole but have had a number of occasions when the site does not recognise my purchases and i have had to raise a claim which is very long and drawn out process .
neutral	resolutions rarely come to fruition .
neutral	meeting was fine , greeting took 00_minutes from call to car - too long
neutral	had a little trouble with 0st order as received partial wrong order .
neutral	had to insist that they send out proper order immediately as i have 0 big dogs between 0 0 / 0 and 00 and in need of food immediately .
neutral	explain to csr and he was the smart one .
neutral	got the food the following_monday and donated puppy_food to foreclosed upon puppies at petsmart .
neutral	dropping my car off the service was perfect , someone there to meet me and all done and dusted in 0mins .
neutral	pick_up however was not good , i called the number at_0am , when i had got my bag and was told my car would be at the pickup point 00 - 00mins later .
neutral	i arrived at the pick_up point and waited , and waited .
neutral	after 00mins i called the number again to be told that the driver was ' having to go around again ' and would be with me in 00_mins , although this clearly wasn_'_t true .
neutral	i waited a further 00_mins and the driver finally showed_up with my car .
neutral	i asked what had taken so long and he said my car had been blocked in by a car with a flat battery .
neutral	these things happen but if i had been told this in the first place i could have waited in the terminal rather in the freezing_cold rain .
neutral	not an experience i would want to repeat .
neutral	please answer your phone if you can return my call
neutral	i '_ve used the service before and had an_issue that customer_service resolved very well .
neutral	however , now that i am looking in oslo , norway , i see that none of the hotels are indicating whether the rooms are smokers rooms or non_- smokers rooms .
neutral	this is a standard where i am from originally , the u . s ., and is very important to me .
neutral	it must be that booking . com is not providing a field for the hotels to complete to provide this info / choice .
neutral	major flaw since - as a result , i am forced to call the hotel i make a reservation with , and possibly go back to the drawing board if it turns_out the hotel i reserved with does not offer the non_- smoker option .
neutral	if i do have to do the work all over again , i '_ll find a hotel agreggator website that can provide this option for me up front .
neutral	if i have to call the hotels directly , then it isn_'_t worth booking first through booking . com
neutral	i still have not received an item from my first order and have not yet been issued a credit .
neutral	i did try to call and was put on hold for an extended length of time and was not able to speak to anyone .
neutral	one pair of boots i ordered had what looked like melted plastic on theml
neutral	i purchased a pair of ray_ban sunglasses .
neutral	i was very happy with your website , payment_options and fast shipping .. however , your courier service completely lets you down , to the extent that i would avoid purchasing again from your website due to the hassle
neutral	a postage slip was left at the door and when we called to organise a redelivery , the package was forgotten several_times and i needed to call every day to find out why the package had not been delivered .
neutral	i was told there was not enough information on the package however when i asked what more was needed other than a name , address and phone_number , the toll customer_service rep was stumped ... i finally received my sunglasses two_weeks after they were initially dispatched ... with at_least 0 phone_calls needed to make_sure they reached me .. i paid $_00 postage for these glasses and did not receive the service i paid for ... i would suggest finding a more reliable company to compliment your online service .
neutral	it such a shame you will loose business because they are disorganised
neutral	as usual glasses on arrival are a perfect fit and good quality .
neutral	however the process has_been difficult with this order - 0 pairs ordered were out of stock and information not sent until some time after order had been reviewed .
neutral	will look around other on line suppliers for next order .
neutral	i ordered my sons skates , and was pleased with the price the delivery price was great , however .............
neutral	when it came to receiving the skates i was out so went online to get them delivered to the local depot .
neutral	my local deport is purley way and it wouldn_'_t let_me book it here , i had to go to se0 .
neutral	where i had to wait an_hour becuase they couldn_'_t find my parcel and there were lots of complaints too .
neutral	rawk is good but would be better to use a different delivery company .
neutral	when they finally did find my parcel i was told it was outside of where it should have been , which signals to me that someone had placed it there to steal later on .
neutral	this is terrible and unacceptable .
neutral	if a card is left then when you arrive to collect your parcel it cannot be found shows that things are dodgy .
neutral	my son got his skates and is very happy .
neutral	clothes were great , but i had to return a dress that was too short and it took a month to receive a credit back .
neutral	i emailed them to check if it takes that long normally and they instantly credited it , so i don_'_t know if something went wrong with mine or if it always takes that long .
neutral	delighted with the bargain i thought i got until i seen same thing in asda for £ 0 each .
neutral	still meant i got a bit of a deal at 0 for £_00 but not as good as what i initially was lead to believe as they retail at £_00 . 00 each on site .
neutral	nice lights but wish i hadnt rushed into buying another 0 sets for family_members who could have taken more time and got gradually from asda
neutral	very helpful but too costly for hotel and airfare !
neutral	do not like added fee to use phone help !!
neutral	!
neutral	the prices cannot be beat here , and it is super easy to make it cheaper if a competitor has a better price .
neutral	the big downside is that the shipping_costs are higher_than most .
neutral	product arrived in excellent condition - but took several days longer_than anticipoated - this review request arrived three_days before the product was delivered which made it seem that the product delivery time was longer_than intended
neutral	having used other meet and greet services , i must_admit i was disappointed with " diamond meet and greet ".
neutral	when i booked online i said i would be at the airport north_terminal at 0 . 00am and they called at 0 . 00am saying that i had booked a collection at the south terminal ( i hadn_'_t and my booking confirmation confirmed that ).
neutral	they called again when we were on our way chasing where we were even_though we were well ahead of our 0 . 00am arrival time .
neutral	on our return they asked us to call once we had landed ( i did ) and then again once we had claimed our_luggage ( i did ).
neutral	they said they would meet us at the same drop_off point .
neutral	i had to call them again to find out where they were as we waited outside in the rain , at 00 . 00am , with a 0 year_old some 00_minutes since claiming our baggage .
neutral	very disappointed ,
neutral	ordered an indesit tuble dryer with all the bells and whistles ( lots of anti crease options , iron options and approx 00 different settings ).
neutral	the exact_same model was available from argos and for a similar price ( approx_£ 0 difference ) we ordered from 000 as we hadn_'_t had a problem with them in the past .
neutral	when we ordered , we were advised delivery was approx 00 days .... we selected our desired delivery date and waited .
neutral	the evening ( yes , evening ) before it was due to be delivered we received a call saying it wasn_'_t going to happen and may be the day after .
neutral	luckily neither or us had booked a day off work to be home to take delivery ( it would have been too late to cancel and we would have wasted a day '_s holiday ) luckily we asked for delivery to our work place .
neutral	the next_day came and went with no phone_call ..... then the following week came and we had to keep phoning to ask where it was .
neutral	by this point , i had enough and phoned up explaining that we have a baby in the house and ( at that point the weather was bad ) needed the tumble_dryer as we both work and dont have time to keep the house looking like a laundrette ..... the guy couldn_'_t have cared less and told me i could always cancel my order - by this point it was 0_weeks since ordering ... there was no understanding , compassion or any acknowledgment of loyalty ( we have ordered approx 0 big items from them over the last 0 years ) or i could change my order to an inferior model with far less programme modes etc and they would graciously refund me the difference in price !
neutral	or i could have a more_expensive model (£ 00 ish ) and pay the difference ..... tumble_dryer eventually turned_up this week , one month after ordering ( found out it was due to be delivered after chasing them for an update ).
neutral	the tumble_dryer itself is great , but thats more to do with indesit than 000 .
neutral	to be honest , they have lost a loyal_customer and would not reccommend them to anyone .....
neutral	try to con you into paying every year when you only want to buy for one .
neutral	you have to figure_out how to switch the roll over off after you pay .
neutral	you can '_t simply opt_out before you purchase .
neutral	it seems a bit underhanded to me , but that '_s what you get for buying cheap travel_insurance i guess .
neutral	really a good web_site to order from , and very cheap prices
neutral	but they need a better suport team , to talk to when you need them
neutral	die_blumen zur beerdigung meiner oma kamen puenklich an . ich hatte ein weisses trauergesteck bestellt_und_es kam leider ein grosser weiss / rosa farbener blumenstrau $ an , der bildlich total abweichend war als online dargestellt !
neutral	=(
neutral	i found it difficult to order online
neutral	the food was delivered in 0 days which was acceptable .
neutral	the box that the ( 0 ) 00_lb , and ( 0 ) 0 lb_bags were pkged in had broken open ......... luckily it was a sunny day .... not raining ..
neutral	i don_'_t feel the pkg was strong_enough to withstand shipment , either the cardboard or the packing_tape .
neutral	then when i checked the exp .
neutral	date on the blue_buffalo cat_food , it was well within the time , but the lot was actually 0 months older than what i got at my tractor_supply_store , at $ 0 . 00 more per bag of blue_buffalo #.
neutral	so i may order from you in a pinch , but wasn_'_t overly impressed .
neutral	check - out cart deleted first - time discount ; wrote to customer_service and had to correspond twice to get it resolved .
neutral	it took over a week to receive a bag of dog_food .
neutral	for the price , it is a decent strand of pearls but i was disappointed because roughly half of the pearls are oval shape .
neutral	the description on the website stated the shape was round however this is not the case
neutral	.
neutral	i carried on with booking a flight without trying other_websites because i had already missed out on a flight that was advertised as being available and i don_'_t think that is good enough .
neutral	if steph hadn_'_t needed to catch a flight to london later that day i would have tried searching again .
neutral	so , would i use this website again , probably not , as it was not wholly reliable in info given .
neutral	this website did a good job of providing information ; however , i wish you could enter an address rather_than a zip_code .
neutral	i finally received my product , but i ordered my coffeetable in april and received it in september .
neutral	we had a lot of correspondence about it and everytime there was another reason_why the coffeetable wasn_'_t going to be delivered yet .
neutral	at the end i received the table , and the table is ok .
neutral	i was disappointed that there was an unpleasant ( to me ) smell to the millet husks .
neutral	i already had a buckwheat_pillow , purchased elsewhere from another source several_years_ago .
neutral	i have used it as a pillow , but thought the millet might be more pleasant .
neutral	i am not returning the millet husk pillow , as i have gone back to sleeping on my buckwheat_pillow , as before .
neutral	i am going to use the millet husk pillow for meditation , as i can '_t smell it .
neutral	i thought i read quite a bit on the website , but either i missed something about the smell issue , or it wasn_'_t clearly indicated .
neutral	i liked the feel of the millet .
neutral	and the absence of sound .
neutral	order was delivered really quickly , although it was lucky my husband happened to be at home as he had to get it off the lorry himself .
neutral	fitting was mostly straight_forward , although the flush mechanism needed adapting as it does not fit in the unit with a water pipe attached , and we still need to buy the bolts to fix the toilet to the floorcascwe didntvrealisevthey weren_'_t included as they always have been with other purchases elsewhere .
neutral	overall quality seems good and service was good , just the points above which spoilt it a bit .
neutral	i was pleased the ink_cartridges ( color & black ) arrived within a very short time_frame .
neutral	although the color ink prints ok , some of the colors look faded and difficult to read .
neutral	when ordering my appliances i was unable to complete the transaction on line so i phoned my order through , the lady was very help full i completed my orders , cooker , hood and a fridge with £_00 of iceland vouchers i was very pleased with the help and support i was given by the lady , we arranged a date for delivery , the delivery service was excellent through out the day every thing went well they kept me up to date on the time of delivery , first_class service from them , so thankyou .
neutral	i phoned the office to get my number so i could give my feed back , i asked them about my vouchers , but they told me i was to late , i was shocked to here that i was to late as i didnt_realise there was a time_slot , this was not explained to me on the phone , i feel this was very misleading and i am not happy about this , this has changed my opinion from an excellent service to a misleading one . not sure now if i would recommend this service to anyone_else , or use it again myself .
neutral	i have found boikler juice very reliab le but do wish they would only send me emails twice a year not every week
neutral	before buying any deal i would recomend that you do a quick search of the product on the internet as i reckon 0 times out of 00 you can get the exact_same product cheaper with the " deal "!
neutral	!
neutral	fox rental_car in san_diego has a very small lot , and on the day i rented , it took me less_than 0 minutes at the counter , but 00_minutes to get out of the traffic_jam .
neutral	the car was a chevy aveo , and it is a turd .
neutral	it has this weird auto starter crank when you turn the key on , and the tire_pressure light stayed on the whole time .
neutral	fox is great value for the money , but i will ask for a different model of car the next time .
neutral	too many days ( 0 ) to be completed the production of my purchase .
neutral	and seven_days more to receive it abroad .
neutral	the whole buying process , from ease of using the website , to ordering , to receiving the item within timescale was excellent .
neutral	the prices on the website are great , no_doubt about it .
neutral	however , i was disappointed when i received the ring as the gold band was way thinner_than in the represented pictures on the website , as was the gold arounf the ' setting ' or the diamond .
neutral	compared to rings available on the high_street , the band is quite inferior .
neutral	it is absolutely a case of you get what you pay for .
neutral	am i happy with what i got for what i paid ?
neutral	yes , of course .
neutral	but in hindsight , i may have been better spending a couple of hundred quid more to have a better quality item ...
neutral	most of my parts came with in a couple of days , some took a week all parts fit except for the brakes were wrong .
neutral	i don_'_t like the fact that you cant call their company to make_sure the parts your ordering are right , and you have to put out the money to find out what they sent is wrong part ... customer_service takes_forever to get back to you when you want to return parts , then they tell you that it may be i ordered wrong part and then they don_'_t get back to you quickly after you tell then they sent a wrong part or their parts are wrong .. very frustrating
neutral	i started_using figleaves many years_ago because my bra size doesn_'_t exist here in the states .
neutral	there used to be free_shipping for orders over $_00 and free returns .
neutral	it also felt_like there were more sales at that time .
neutral	i can appreciate that perhaps this wasn_'_t cost_effective for the company .
neutral	it would be nice if there could be more deals offered to loyal_customers .
neutral	was abit let_down as some of the photos wasn_'_t very clear .
neutral	shame as layout and service was great but just the couple that are blurry ruined it abit x
neutral	the hostel was easy to find , it was very clean it had a nice small kitchen but there was no real common area so you couldn_'_t really meet new people and that is just way i go to hostels .
neutral	i ordered a pair of sunglasses with prescription lenses .
neutral	i need to have very dark lenses due to a eye condition and i specifically ordered polycarbonate lenses with a vlt rating of 00_%, meaning that only 00_% of light can pass through them .
neutral	when they arrived the lenses were so light i could clearly see my eyes in the mirror , and was still squinting when i went outside in daylight .
neutral	when i called about the issue they apologized , but didn_'_t offer an explanation for why they post a vlt of 00_% if that '_s not what they deliver .
neutral	they offered to replace the lenses with plastic lenses that could be tinted darker .
neutral	plastic is not as durable as polycarbonate , and is cheaper material but they did not refund me any of my payment .
neutral	when i finally got my replacement lenses they were a bit darker than the originals , but nowhere_near my raybans which have a 00_% vlt , much less 00_%.
neutral	i am disappointed that they would advertise lenses that are rated a certain tint and then not provide that product .
neutral	floraqueen was selected from the internet as seeming to be value for money but having seen a picture of the flowers delivered to my granddaughter in florida , i was more than a little disappointed .
neutral	i felt they were rather expensive for what was delivered .
neutral	will not use floraqueen again .
neutral	i ordered a flower deliver on friday 00th_oct to be delivered to the recipient in utah usa on monday - selecting ' before 0pm ' option given .
neutral	i received the order confirmation .
neutral	i have never received advice that the delivery was made , and contacted customer_services on tuesday 00th_oct - they replied to say they would get in touch with their local supplier and get back to me shortly .
neutral	nothing received and again i messaged customer_services for any update .
neutral	thankfully the recipient got in touch on wednesday 00th_oct to say thank_you the delivery had been received .
neutral	but to date still nothing received from floraqueen - so no_explanation or recompense for my order not being delivered when specified .
neutral	i will not be ordering from floraqueen again and cannot say strongly enough that keeping the person_who has placed the order up to date is paramount .
neutral	hotel was nice ... some what overcrowded and hotel cleaning staff was a bit too loud but overall experience was good
neutral	great size and quality throw but colours re very muted , bought it to match curtains and it is considerably lighter in colour , very pretty but .
neutral	great shame .
neutral	wouldn_'_t have been happy if had paid full price for it
neutral	the app says we charge no fees but the amount taken out of my account does have extra_fees from the price quoted .
neutral	i do like the easy use of the app and speed .
neutral	i will use this website , but i will avoid to buying from the abc gift_card .
neutral	finding the checkout on the web_page is not very clear .
neutral	i love order from fashion queen but there is always missing things when i got my order .
neutral	and getting answers about mine questions from email is not everytime quickly .
neutral	waiting time for orders to getting home is always take long time
neutral	i tracked my package and it sat in one place for over 0 days and over a week to get !
neutral	there was no option for over nighting the part , which i needed very much .
neutral	the part came in such a huge box and the part itself was small so that big box was unnecessary .
neutral	overall im glad i got the part and i didn_'_t have to pay an_arm and leg for it .
neutral	i ordered 0 - 0 ft leland cypress .
neutral	i had looked at this same size tree at a local_nursery and it was just what i wanted .
neutral	i ordered the tree from brighter booms at 00_%_off and free_shipping .
neutral	doesn_'_t get much_better_than that !
neutral	no_worries_about how i was going to get the tree home , it would be delivered right to my door !
neutral	the tree arrived within a couple days .
neutral	i was so pleased , until i opened the box .
neutral	it looks very healthy and is indeed 0 - 0 ft tall but it is the scrawniness tree i '_ve ever_seen .
neutral	reminds_me of a charlie brown christmas_tree !
neutral	i planted the tree and am hoping that it grows very quickly as it looks a bit silly standing all by itself in my front yard .
neutral	we are really pleased with our finished photo_albums ... everyone who sees them thinks they are just superb and great value for money ..
neutral	... what a nausiating job though - put onto the user to get a decent layout .... you chose your photos from the folder ... dead easy ... then use the creation wizard ... sounds straight_forward - however the daft thing seems to literally just " plonk " things incredibly randomly with all_sorts of weird shapes and sizes ... then theres the nesting of images ,,,---... well great photos of handbags etc , but no faces visible .. wrongly sized in aperture and in wrong position ..... so to rectify this 0 . 0hours of deleting images , selecting layouts then dragging and dropping the images ....
neutral	i '_ve only ordered one pair of shoes from this company and it was an online purchase , therefore this may not be an across the board experience .
neutral	however , i thought i was ordering a deep red / wine colored shoe when in fact they were rather purple .
neutral	proper lighting and position of the shoe was to blame .
neutral	i understand how the mistake could have happened as when i looked at the shoe in a slightly_lower light it looked exactly as it did in the picture .
neutral	what was misleading is the label of red shoe on the product .
neutral	i feel that most people when viewing the shoe in person would label it as purple .
neutral	i felt mislead and it all came down to poor labeling and a bad picture .
neutral	i called to see what my flight options were for a trip i was trying to book online .
neutral	the guy found a flight i liked and after waiting some time for him to book it , he told me there ' d been an_error and it booked the wrong flight .
neutral	he put me on hold over and over and finally sent me to customer_service who put me on hold over and over .
neutral	long_story , that flight was not even available anymore by the time they were ready to book .
neutral	so i settled for another one .
neutral	total almost 0 hours on the phone trying to book my vacation .
neutral	:(
neutral	order went well , text to say when it would be dlivered on a friday_evening .
neutral	never arrived .
neutral	could not contact company until monday , who dealt_with it imediately but didnt get bed until tuesday_morning .
neutral	all would have been good but it was a present for daughters_birthday on the saturday .
neutral	she was disappointed .
neutral	but its here now and she is happy .
neutral	good product and delivery time but not sure whether accurate colour description
neutral	got the part at the correct time , no_issues with the part .
neutral	however the box was a mess .
neutral	not sure who handled it inappropriately i '_m just glad the mirror was still intact
neutral	your ordering process is professional , speedy and the food comes well - packaged .
neutral	what i don_'_t like is the continual push during the ordering process to sign - up for regular delivery .
neutral	i was certain i had said no at each opportunity , yet was surprised to find a package of food delivered i did not believe i ordered .
neutral	i went_onto the web_site and found numerous future dates entered at which time i would be delivered dog_food .
neutral	i cancelled the dates on the website and then called your customer_service who confirmed that i had no deliveries scheduled in the future .
neutral	if this happens again ( delivery of a package i didn_'_t order ), i will cancel the service entirely .
neutral	amount of rentals are great .
neutral	availability of books not so great .
neutral	i have a wide foot so getting shoes to fit is a problem .
neutral	even_though i ordered the wide width they were a little snug at first , but they have stretched enough that they are now quite comfortable .
neutral	and they look great .
neutral	very prompt delivery ( ordered late wednesday , received friday_morning ) but unfortunately the wellies came up a little small .
neutral	garden_xl doesn_'_t seem to make men '_s size 00 boots , either , so we ' re a bit stuck now !
neutral	we ' d recommend buying a size_bigger_than usual to make plenty of room for toes and wellie_socks .
neutral	when i ordered my glasses , they were not available for the try on feature on the website .
neutral	i used the cd method and the assistance of the customer_service person_who was very nice .
neutral	since i '_ve owned the glasses , i have problems with them not fitting properly and was told by one rep to go to walmart and try nose_pads , and i did .
neutral	they are still ill fitting .
neutral	so i called back and was told , this time by allen , that it was too early for an optician to be in , but that someone would definitely call me back .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting and that was last wee !.
neutral	the worst part is i feel_like that was a well used line to get people off of the phone without a hassle !
neutral	i feel_duped !
neutral	although it took a while , it did arrive when they said it would .
neutral	i provided the names of all involved in the meeting , many_times we refer to each by name , but the transcriber identified everyone as " male and female " makes it difficult to track .
neutral	the service was mainly good , had a few problems with the website whilst trying to complete the transaction so had to use a different device .
neutral	the two dresses that i ordered were fine but the wet look leggings had a huge hole down the seam where the item had not been well made .
neutral	overall the service was average because the bad quality of the leggings let it down but i was happy with the delivery time and costs and the majority of items were fine :)
neutral	parcel was open when it arrived , not so good regarding that there were 0 toners in it .
neutral	fast delivery though
neutral	however very disappointed that i was unable to get refund ( only exchange or credit note ) for returns to shops - very unlikely to use service again for this reason .
neutral	the light_bulbs we ordered were great but the postage was disgusting they were well_wrapped but £ 0 was exorbitant on a £ 0 order
neutral	website was easy to use and able to order flowers just a day before delivery .
neutral	first thing in the morning , i was advised they were en_route - delivery was to a primary school .
neutral	by the close of school they had not arrived and i could not contact serenata_flowers by email , online_chat or telephone without either asking for a refund or to re deliver another day .... neither what i wanted .
neutral	flowers arrived approx 0 . 00 and fortunately a member of staff was still on site .
neutral	i have recently ordered a lemon trree .
neutral	i was so thrilled wih the quality of the plant , the packaging and shipping that i decided to use this company again .
neutral	i ordered an olive tree and fig tree .
neutral	the olive tree arrived beautifully .... and is doing great !
neutral	i was concerned_about the fig tree immediately .
neutral	the tag said fig but planting_instructions were for a kiwi .
neutral	the tree showed no sign of life or growth on delivery .
neutral	i have been really caring for it and monitoring it since planting and nothing has happened ,.
neutral	it appears to be dead .
neutral	i wrote to customer_service a few_weeks back and have had no reply .
neutral	sadly , this was disappointing as i had wanted to order mother '_s day gifts and a tree for my sister .
neutral	i am reluctant to do that since i have not had a return customer_service reply .
neutral	i booked my flight , hotel and car through_travelocity because it seemed an efficient way to get things done .
neutral	turns_out my flight confirmation only showed a seat_assignment on the return flight and when i called travelocity , i was told i ' d have to make arrangements at the gate for my outbound flight .
neutral	i wasn_'_t too pleased with that , so hung_up , called the airline_directly and got a seat_assignment .
neutral	then , when it turned_out my daughter would be accompanying me on my trip , i called travelocity to change my hotel reservation from a non_- smoking king to a non_- smoking double - no change in rate was involved .
neutral	the travelocity customer_service rep asked if he could put me on hold while he phoned the hotel ... no problem .
neutral	there were two more holds since he said the line was busy , and when he finally got back to me , he said i ' d have to make arrangements for the " upgrade " when i got to the hotel .
neutral	i said it wasn_'_t an upgrade , but he said no , he could not make the change .
neutral	i would have to do it when i got to the hotel .
neutral	small things , but somewhat irritating .
neutral	i purchased a livingsocial deal for $_00 worth of merchandise for $_00 and i thought it was a great way to try petflow out .
neutral	i ordered a 0 pound_bag of royal_canin dog_food and a nyla bone .
neutral	i received the 0 pound_bag of dog_food in one box and another box with 0 pounds of cat_food in another box ( same day ).
neutral	i called and got it straightened_out relatively easily .
neutral	the next_day i got the nyla bone - thought that was it .
neutral	the next_day got another nyla bone .
neutral	had to call and get it straightened_out again .
neutral	my one order turned into 0 orders and i had to be credited all of these charges back to my credit_card .
neutral	one simple order resulted in phone_calls , a trip to the fedex store and a lot of confusion on my credit_card statement .
neutral	tighten it up , petflow , and you '_ll be very successful .
neutral	delivery a day late as rang at 0 . 00 and couldn_'_t find address and had gone back to warehouse .
neutral	box had been bashed about and hence the plastic clip to hold hood on was snapped in four pieces .
neutral	managed to superglue it .
neutral	pleased with the buggy - city_link need more care and commitment to your firm .
neutral	love the sofa but i ordered gray and was sent brown .
neutral	i called and let them know and still_haven_'_t heard back .
neutral	i live in florida and have been looking all over for something that would fit in my small space so i changed the color of my room rather_than having to send it back to brooklyn and have to wait for the one i ordered .
neutral	easy to book .. good images of hotel .
neutral	best price
neutral	i came to this website through ( logo ). com looking to purchase christmas / holiday gift_cards for some of the many picky tweens , pre_- teens , teens and college kids in my life .
neutral	once upon a time i would get them through my bank but as of recently they no_longer offer ( logo ) gift_cards .
neutral	thats too bad because i purchase many throughout the year averaging a hundred_dollars each .
neutral	i do wish that i could have purchased some more to give to my friends & family overseas .
neutral	i went with the pre_- designs .
neutral	the cards look great for the most part .
neutral	there are a few that the images are grainy .
neutral	i did not like that i had to reenter my message for each card all because i wanted to somewhat personalize something impersonal and not give everyone the exact_same card image .
neutral	it was time_consuming and errors ( on my part ) did happen .
neutral	oh well .
neutral	giftcards . com delivered them within the promised 0 - 00 business days , 0 to be exact .
neutral	so , with all that said and even with the little hiccups that resulted in the 0 - star_rating i would purchase gift_cards again through giftcards . com
neutral	my experience here wasn_'_t too bad .
neutral	place promises climate free , bug & pest free , and space wise was good .
neutral	my bill i paid late , 0 hours after i paid , i came there expecting to move stuff out , i couldn_'_t because there was a blue lock on there that should '_ve been removed by the staff upon payment .
neutral	came back the next_day , only to make my move out even harder with no available carts .
neutral	during the past 0 months time at ths farmingdale location , the bathroom was always atrocious .
neutral	no toilet paper , toilet_seat always soiled and clogged , and bathroom itself has trash all over it .
neutral	staff should routinely make more routine inspections maybe every hour .
neutral	parking should be swept by private company every night , which it never seems that it is . staff should remove blue locks upon payment .
neutral	i have used this location in the past , everytime i see the same issues that just doesnt .
neutral	get addressed .
neutral	cool concept , need to work on inventory management .
neutral	they ran_out of an item we tried to purchase and we found out after it shipped .
neutral	the prices are great on the site , order was processed quickly but shipping takes 0_weeks .
neutral	:(
neutral	i found this site in a search and the ordering process easy .
neutral	other_companies came up with my item but the price was the best and no shipping .
neutral	i don_'_t like the fact that there wasn_'_t any returns on my product but it is a name_brand case and shouldn_'_t be any_problems .
neutral	it was a special order item .
neutral	the order was simple enough to place .
neutral	the package arrived quickly .
neutral	the product itself was not stellar , and i immediately wrote them to complain and exchange it for something_else , but haven_'_t heard_anything back yet .
neutral	hellooooooooooo !
neutral	anybody out there ???????
neutral	?
neutral	my order did not contain any shipping slip / packing_slip and it was missing an item .
neutral	i was in desperate search of a side_view_mirror for my husbands truck when i finally found one afforable on partgeek .
neutral	i opened as soon as i got it and noticed it has the heat emblem on the glass .
neutral	my husband installed it with no time for a return due to state inspection being due .
neutral	it attached however he could not hook up the power because of the heating mechanism on the back where it mounts .
neutral	it '_s not a big deal to my husband since it '_s on the driver_side he can manually adjust it but i did pay extra for the power !
neutral	bummer
neutral	i have had a problem with ordering .
neutral	i have called your call_centre 0 times in one week .
neutral	by the time someone actually calls back the deal is over .
neutral	i lost two deals this way .
neutral	i was advised by one of your customer_services that even_though i was trying to pay by in putting two different credit_cards it may work better if i went through pay_pal .
neutral	i have since done that .
neutral	if i did not have a pay_pal account i would have stopped dealing_with you all together .
neutral	it provides a good background and insight_into photography but sometimes the on - line experience is limited and could do with a bit more interaction aside from the optional assignments , maybe something more like the last modules which have videos .
neutral	as many videos on you tube are readily_available , something like this in a teaching format would be more ideal as_opposed to searching for videos that contradict each other or give their own input .
neutral	also not everyone will have photoshop , so maybe discoutns off products and a separate course material into editing would be ideal .
neutral	a more interactive experience would bring a better appeal as at present it would attract those who would like to get into photography .
neutral	from my own personal experience , i had played around with manual settings and went to family functions and outdoor experiences which gave a more grounded perspective .
neutral	i could not complete this due to part of the shipment being broken and returned and awaiting refund
neutral	first problem -- i was not able to order online and pay for the book using my credit_card information and have the book shipped to my grandson at a different address .
neutral	second problem -- there was no bookbyte phone_number and i was unable to get the shipping problem_solved online .
neutral	i finally had the book sent to my home address .
neutral	third problem -- the problem was that the spanish book i ordered for my grandson needed and access_code and there was no mention of this on the bookbyte site .
neutral	i only found that out after he went to class with the book .
neutral	i ended_up having to buy two access codes from the publisher of the book at a cost $_00 and $_00 each .
neutral	this increased the cost of the book rental considerably .
neutral	00dollarmall . com is great for providing clothes at an affordable price .
neutral	i '_ve had a couple instances_where it took my product a very long time to be processed and shipped .
neutral	other than that my experiences are positive .
neutral	i do wish they offered more variety of plus size styles and shoes .
neutral	they need more shoes in size 00 or 00 .
neutral	i ordered one pair but they ran way too small and couldn_'_t get my foot into it .
neutral	also , i wish they offered more jackets and dresses with sleeves .
neutral	i would also like to see some pajama sets and jackets .
neutral	paid for saturday delivery at around 0pm on a friday , waiting in all day as you do when you pay for something to arrive that day especially .
neutral	by 0pm i contacted boohoo to see what time latest delivery was , got told 0pm ... which was fine with me as wasn_'_t going out till 0ish .
neutral	was also told my item was out for delivery .
neutral	didnt arrive , then was told my item would not arrive till the following saturday as it was ' saturday delivery '.
neutral	looked at the online tracking on the monday only to find out that the delivery company didnt actually receive the parcel till the sunday !
neutral	boohoo basically took no responsibility for this , i got my delivery money back ... but only credited to my online account !
neutral	very unhappy with the service , paid for a service which i didn_'_t receive !
neutral	i feel that the pages are wasteful .
neutral	i never use labels , so i have to discard so much of the sheet .
neutral	years_ago i would get 00 stamps on a sheet .
neutral	what ever happened to that ?
neutral	i love the chicken nuggets , but at times the food is too greasy .
neutral	i usually have an ok experience , but last_year i got food poisoning from the sausage breakfast sandwich , i still can '_t eat breakfast sausage because i got so sick .
neutral	i love starbucks , but it is too expensive .
neutral	they recently added a new line of juices .
neutral	they are really good , but cost over 0 $ per bottle , it is ridiculous !
neutral	if you want to order online , add online , one time order , repeat ... easy and fast .
neutral	heaven help you if you want to cancel a repeat shipment .
neutral	you cannot do it online , you have to call .
neutral	so if you aren_'_t home and just have internet ... good luck with that .
neutral	absolutely so ruined it for me i will never do auto - ship again with this company .
neutral	if you can spend money without calling , for them to pretend not spending is for your benefit instead of make it hard to cancel .. that insults my intelligence .
neutral	i wish they had a better selection of plus size clothing
neutral	i can not say anything yet until we at the hotel
neutral	i ordered a oil cap for a 0000_dodge jourey and it will not work they sent me the wrong one ..
neutral	on slow hours they dont do so bad , but during meal times , especially during dinner , they ' re super slow and encounter a lot of problems placing our orders at the restaurant
neutral	i recently placed an order from petswag and received a tracking_number a few_days_later for one of my items .
neutral	that one item arrived as_promised but i received no word about the remaining items in my order .
neutral	i logged_into my account and saw that my order was marked as ' complete ' yet i was still missing two items .
neutral	i called petswag and left messages twice and was put off that i couldn_'_t get someone on the phone and i never received a call back .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received my remaining items , which had been shipped to me directly from the manufacturer .
neutral	in the end , my order was completed and i '_m happy with my purchase but i would have appreciated an_email or phone_call from petswag to simply tell me that my items were coming .
neutral	the customer_service at petswag ( or lack thereof ) does seem a bit unprofessional , which will cause me to hesitate before placing another order or recommending this website .
neutral	i found amazing glasses .
neutral	so many to chose from .
neutral	but my order placed on 00 / 0 / 0000 has_been repeatedly put on back order .
neutral	i am so disappointed .
neutral	i am giving 0_stars because 0 of the four bridesmaids_dresses were here with no_issues and all 0 were beautiful .
neutral	however the last dress was ordered late , probably mid june so we paid the 00 extra to have it rush_cut .
neutral	the email said it would be here by july 00 .
neutral	when it wasn_'_t here the second week of august i called and was informed that that '_s not a solid date and the designer can be up to 0_weeks_later then that date ( it was over 0_weeks late ) so of course i would have to just eat it on the 00 extra dollars .
neutral	i will say that the women i spoke to was really nice , and i didn_'_t push the issue .
neutral	she said it would be about one more week with shipping .
neutral	the dress didn_'_t show up till friday the 00 th of august , my wedding was sept , 0 .
neutral	she was the only one who couldn_'_t get alterations and all the other girls had theirs shortened from tea length to right above the knee .
neutral	still , she looked great and i thought all the dresses we pretty ( i kinda wish i had got one ) so in the end i guess as long as you order way in advance things should be great , but the rush_cut was a rip_off , if you don_'_t have at_least 00 weeks i would go another route .
neutral	there is no way to save your cart .
neutral	sometimes i take days to make final purchase decisions but then have to search all over again .
neutral	also , twice_now i '_ve placed an order and several days_later i found out that the item has_been cancelled due to being out of stock .
neutral	big_bus_tours are well run and friendly and informative .......
neutral	in peak_times it would be good to run more buses and they should run school trip only buses .
neutral	we never got to sit on the open top_deck as it was filled by school groups , the majority of the students weren_'_t actually interested in the comentary or views so this spolit it for many tourists who would have loved to have seen the unique view the open top upper_deck offers .
neutral	we heard the same from a lot of visitors both uk & abroad .
neutral	in the end we didn_'_t use the bus as much as we could have due to the crowding and lack of seats upstairs .
neutral	the river_trip was great and once the school trips decamped at the tower of london much_nicer , again spolit by school trips who were disinterested in the commentary and views but wanted the best seats .
neutral	special mention for the riverboat commentary which was provided free by watermen who only asked for a voluntary donation - it was the best commentary of the day !
neutral	ordered item on nov_00th after being let_down by another company .
neutral	item only arrived today dec_00th .
neutral	i didn_'_t realise when ordering that it was coming from denmark !
neutral	anyway panic now over .
neutral	hope it '_s ok when my grandaughter opens it .
neutral	i ordered two books and they were both showing that they were available .
neutral	they shipped_separately , one coming more than a week after the first one .
neutral	there was a huge coffee - like stain on the back couple of pages on the book that arrived last , not sure why - they weren_'_t used books , i an happy to have them both as my class_starts soon .
neutral	they price was cheaper_than a few other_sites , so i ma happy with that .
neutral	i was very pleased with the price of the replacement_mirror for my 0000_toyota_camry , but the option to buy only gave_me 0000 - 0000 passenger_side_mirror as a description and when the mirror arrived , it was not identical to the one attached to my car .
neutral	i did not need the whole casing of the passenger_side_mirror , just the mirrow itself was broken .
neutral	i pulled the mirror , that i ordered from you , out of the casing and it was not identical to the original mirror .
neutral	the backside would not snap into place because one mirror had a square center attachment and one had a round center attachment .
neutral	what i hoped would be a simple fix , is turning into a problem .
neutral	now i will have to hire someone to replace the whole mirror with casing and maybe even have it painted to match my original .
neutral	selecting items on the website was easy , prices are great but i have not recieved my shipped items yet and when i look up the tracking_number it says they are still in california from over a week_ago .
neutral	i booked a room online and paid for it .
neutral	i got to the hotel in osage beach , mo , and they didn_'_t have any paper_work on us booking a room through_travelocity !!
neutral	and they said that they could have given us some more discounts then travelocity did .
neutral	when it came to check out , they said that we owed for the bill and charged me a different amount .
neutral	so i got billed_twice for the same room .
neutral	i will never trust travelocity again !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i paid for 0 day delivery & it took 0 not counting the holiday in there .
neutral	didn_'_t make me happy .
neutral	we like the way the hotels are presented , and it is easy to find what you are looking for , but .... we booked a hotel for $_00 . 00 & tax - only to find when we arrived that there was another $_00 . 00 to pay for resort_fees , which are non_- negotiable .
neutral	if there are charges that are not negotiable , then they should be shown in the booking price , not a surprise upon_arrival .
neutral	we may have chosen another hotel based on those additional_charges .
neutral	got this email before i even recieved the parts !!!
neutral	will let ya know after i know they were right eh .....
neutral	i enjoy receiving our spoiled_rotten_box every_month and the humans are more excited about it then our pets .
neutral	i just wish it had a little_bit more for big dogs in it or that you would have the option to ask for a small / medium / large_breed dog size box .
neutral	i didn_'_t care for there shipping one bag of dog bones the bottom of the bag was split_open and dog bones broke everything was covered in dog_bone pieces .
neutral	wow , this was a wonderful experience up until the last moment .
neutral	i received the part in less_than 00_hours .
neutral	unbelievably fast .
neutral	the part received was correct and functioned flawlessly .
neutral	imagine my disappointment when i found out that i would have to pay return shipping on the core .
neutral	to get my $_00 back , it cost $_00 to ship it .
neutral	this is not acceptable !
neutral	this should just be hidden in the cost of the purchase .
neutral	do something because now i am dissatisfied and will look elsewhere for future parts .
neutral	at_least it should be made clear that the return is on me so that this could be considered with the purchase .
neutral	my husband and i recently toured london , stockholm , estonia , copenhagen and belgium .
neutral	we took the bigbus tours because our friends recommend them highly .
neutral	stockholm was the best with a great tour_guide , modern buses and wi_-_fi !
neutral	!
neutral	others not as new but good trips except for copenhagen .
neutral	worst_experience ever .
neutral	old buses , head sets didn_'_t work , buses dirty and the driver stayed in several spots for over 0 / 0 hour to fill the bus .
neutral	good thing this was our last stop or we would not have used bigbus again .
neutral	waste of $_00 american dollars .
neutral	what a same you don_'_t deliver to jersey channel_islands
neutral	frames were in good condition and perfectly lovely .
neutral	lenses were don e incorrectly and am waiting for a monetary adjustment .
neutral	i had a very quick delivery and i thought the price was brilliant but the bikini was a completely different fit than what i was expecting from the photos and the colour were very different too .
neutral	it '_s not good customer_service when you lock in at a certain price and a few_months later your monthly expense increases by $_00 .
neutral	if i wanted to get a unit at a cheaper price , i would then have to move all my stuff .
neutral	i live in the boon docks in central tx , so i order things online all the time .
neutral	i have no_idea what i bought from this vendor , and the email_asking me to review it didn_'_t bother to refresh my memory .
neutral	the route was very interesting but the commentary was very weak with minimal information .
neutral	long gaps filled with music which became irritating .
neutral	i really found the site helpful but the person i had to deal with over the when i called to ask specific questions fast talking qnd pushy !
neutral	they take long to answer emails through the support email and the products are okthe last two orders i made had a damage product each , and if i send it i have to pay the shipping !!
neutral	!
neutral	items are reasonably_priced and are good fashion but each time i have order something i have had to return them due to them either being too small then next time i learnt to order size_bigger_than normal but they still fit poorly .
neutral	shame as there are some nice styles .
neutral	however very easy to order , quick delivery , free returns and quick refund .
neutral	i also received an_email to say that i had been refunded .
neutral	in the past goldstar has done an awesome job in getting terrific seats .
neutral	this last time you could_barely make out the batter .
neutral	ughhh may not consider buying tickets again
neutral	the delivery didn_'_t come in until a few_days after promised date & when i got it , product was damaged .
neutral	guess price was just too good to be true .
neutral	i was lead to believe that the furniture would be delivered as it was seen in the showroom which was not the case .
neutral	i did not realise that you would have to put the handles on the right side of the drawers and take bits of wood off feet and screw on the foot protectors .
neutral	although it was not flat pack i think the advertising in store was misleading .
neutral	travelocity has_been my go - to travel site but recently they removed the check 0 days before and after feature when researching travel dates .
neutral	shame that some of the erange i need at work ( pe teacher ) is no_longer available -
neutral	the book arrived on time , with the internet code apparently intact .
neutral	i have not tried it yet .
neutral	the book was excessively highlighted in several colors .
neutral	either the student '_s 0 year_old sibling got ahold of it , or the student was unable to grasp a salient point and so underlined everything , in blue , pink and yellow .
neutral	my eyes bounce when i read it .
neutral	books that are in a state this bad should have a warning attached .
neutral	it would only take a minute to give a better description of the book '_s condition .
neutral	i would have paid more if i could have received a book with no highlighting marks .
neutral	i have no problem with your site or the prices of your products etc .
neutral	however , i have a big problem with your delivery methods and the fact that the customer_service reps i have talked to did not even pretend to care about my problem when i brought it to their attention .
neutral	probably 00_% of the people who use your site probably will not have the same problem but 00_% would if something does not change .
neutral	i live in a rural_area and do not get us postal mail delivered there so i use a po_box ... fed_ex and ups regularly delivers to my physical home address .
neutral	your site says it uses fed_ex which i * thought * meant that i would get them delivered to my physical home address .
neutral	that didn_'_t happen , because apparently fed_ex delivers to the us postal service which does not deliver to my home address .
neutral	now the shipment has_been returned to bookbyte , and it has_been a week since i heard_anything from them about when the order will be reshipped .
neutral	the class that i need the book for has started and i do not have my book yet !!
neutral	suggestion_: your site needs to be clearer about the fact that even_though fed_ex is used , fed_ex delivers to the us postal service and that the us postal service is actually the ones who deliver the package to the customer .
neutral	if i had known this up front , this problem would have been avoided and i would not be receiving a grade of 0 due to the fact that i don_'_t have my book even_though i ordered it with plenty of time to spare .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i placed an order last_week , my second order on this web_site .
neutral	your web_site indicated free_shipping for orders over ( certain_amount ) and my order greatly exceeded that amount .
neutral	i ordered 0 items , demarin for large dogs and a flea application for large dogs .
neutral	i was charged 0 . 00 shipping with no_explanation as to why these items did not qualify for free_shipping ; and i still do not have the order .
neutral	i ordered these items before from another online pet_supply web_site and received free_shipping and had the order within 0 days .
neutral	i will have to consider all costs before i decide to order from this web_site again .
neutral	the hotel was a hidden gem .
neutral	looked like a fifties drive up , but clean rooms , great view , friendly and accommodating owner .
neutral	spirit_airlines ...... no_frills flying .... got motion sick on the descent and heaven forbid i get any help without paying money .
neutral	plus the flight was nearly two hours delayed .
neutral	three_days_later , i '_m still recovering .
neutral	usually us another service but always get same carrier company my hermes to pick_up .
neutral	had to wait 0 days for booked pick_up .
neutral	too long so will go back to other company .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	hot and cold
neutral	your prices are good , decent shipping prices , can use discount_codes but your web_site is difficult to use , very slow , did not receive a confirmation
neutral	email and also my order did not show up on your website under my orders .
neutral	i was not sure if i had an order or not but then it showed_up at my door .
neutral	its no different then going to a store except u can '_t try them on before purchase .
neutral	the prices are affordable and the addtional %_off they offer very regularly allow you to buy an_additional pair .
neutral	i bought 0pair shoes , 0 for my sister & 0 for me .
neutral	i knew sizes was questionable , their questionable when i walk in the store .
neutral	i dont see why people get bent outta shape about that when ordering online .
neutral	it should be expected , especially if you dont_know who the ' maker ' is , like when you order from amiclubwear .
neutral	my sister shoes fit , 0 of mine just fit size 0 . 0 and the other was too little size0 .
neutral	i wear anywhere from 0 - 0 . 0 .
neutral	but the last couple pair off brand shoes were too big at size 0 . 0 , even some 0s .
neutral	delivery is awfully slow , even for ground .
neutral	i can get something thru postal service quicker .
neutral	my only real compliant is i had to search for return info because nothing was with the packaging .
neutral	by time locate , it had been 0wks .. may as well keep them .
neutral	i have another sister who feet are smaller then mine .
neutral	her bday next month !
neutral	have used site many_times however i have never been issued with a password so have to enter all details each time i book .
neutral	otherwise simple and easy process .
neutral	jetpark 0 is simple , quick and stress_free .
neutral	i got an online deal for a discounted order from petflow .
neutral	they did have the prescription cat_food that i needed , but it was kind of hard to place the order .
neutral	the site kept messing up and the search wouldn_'_t find my vet .
neutral	it took several tries to get it ordered .
neutral	then the email they sent me couldn_'_t be viewed through gmail , but i was able to finally see it on my phone ( and i swear i am a pretty technical person ).
neutral	after about 0 days i still didn_'_t see the order even_though it says fast shipping from fed_ex .
neutral	i talked to a customer_service guy_who was very helpful and said that it was being shipped usps from somewhere closer to my house and that i would get an_email when it shipped .
neutral	when i got home it was there , but i never got the email .
neutral	so all in all i would order from them again , but i felt it was a little disorganized .
neutral	and they send an_email almost every day for a sale , which is a bit_annoying .
neutral	i required some supplies for a training session so looked online to find the company with the quickest delivery timeframe .
neutral	this is how i came about optomo .
neutral	after_placing my order and entering my credit_card details , an ' error ' occured ...
neutral	i contacted the company immediately .
neutral	the gentleman was very friendly and helpful - explained they were having difficulties with online payments and so i gave him my details over the phone ( i do not like to do this usually ...).
neutral	he said that the package should arrive by monday or tuesday - they arrived on the friday .
neutral	i like that i can make calls to other_countries it '_s convenient .
neutral	the only issue i have is there is a constant ekco and delay .
neutral	i hear myself and the other party ekcoing .
neutral	i ordered 00 boas the shipping on it was almost $_00 !
neutral	about 0 / 0 of my total ordering price .
neutral	i recived them , opened them and they are not what i expected .
neutral	the description seems to be inaccurate , and the photo misleading .
neutral	the boas were very cheaply_made , made a mess everywhere .
neutral	my delivery was despatched one day late , although i was refunded the delivery charge .
neutral	but then my delivery arrived broken ( probably more due to yodel )
neutral	quick customer_service response , i was refunded in full , and they were very apologetic .
neutral	i like the lower price and service was good .
neutral	i got my order promptly .
neutral	however i don_'_t like the taste of the coffee as much as the original nespresso_pods .
neutral	also the decaf is not water processed but treated with solvents .
neutral	their offer wasn_'_t as attractive as what they offered on their website to new customers .
neutral	if you ' re going to advertise a discount and ask new customers to and donate to shelters in an area hit with a tragedy , you really need to make the deal better_than what '_s on your website .
neutral	it looked a little shady to me .
neutral	it '_s funny you should ask for this information as it is now 00 days_later and still no alternator .
neutral	i tracked it and it has_been sitting in denver since the 00th , would sure like them to decide to ship it !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered 0 pieces , one of which was so badly finished that it gave_me splinters , it should have never left the factory .
neutral	i was initially fobbed_off that photos didnt show the issues very well and that they couldn_'_t guarentee the replacement would be better !
neutral	i looked into the cost of refinishing it and sent them the quote .
neutral	a quality checked replacement was delivered promptly and the reject collected at the same time by very courteous delivery people .
neutral	pure_formulas has a great product selection and good prices but i had a problem with one of the items in my delivery and sent them an_email about it and they never even got back with me .
neutral	so one of my items was basically unusable and that part is very disappointing .
neutral	i prefer nutro canned_dog_food for my senior toy_poodle .
neutral	you don_'_t offer a full inventory as compared to my store .
neutral	i also received a substiture in one order .
neutral	however , i like the convenience of ordering online and having the products delivered to my door .
neutral	i also don_'_t think you should charge tax as most online sites do not charge it .
neutral	i am moving all my belongings in storage and this is a stressful time .
neutral	even_though i explained this move involves all my personal_belongings , the assistant failed to ask me if i needed climate_controlled .
neutral	luckily , i read the confirmation and realized the unit was not climate_controlled .
neutral	it would be nice if the assistant could ask just to be sure about whether climate_controlled is needed .
neutral	i had to call back and inquire once i received the email_confirmation .
neutral	love amazon
neutral	although do not sell on market place im still_waiting on funds !!!
neutral	!
neutral	a lovely bed for my daughter , however when we unpacked the box we found 0 damaged sections with also some parts if the bed not having the holes pre drilled in to fix the bed / storage draw together ( very frustrating )
neutral	when we called homebase the bed is currently out of stock so they could not replace the bed
neutral	but could offer us £_00 off to keep the bed how it was which was not expectable .
neutral	0weeks later and still_waiting to hear back from homebase ...
neutral	i would have scored higher but i paid_extra for a vase for the flowers to be delivered in .
neutral	the flowers did not arrive in the vase .
neutral	my mother could not use the vase because the stems of the amaryllis were too thin to fit into the neck of the vase .
neutral	i was shocked to see that all the windows in the bus had screens in them , which prevented me from seeing clearly or from taking pictures out the windows .
neutral	with a different company in washington_dc , i was able to get great pictures out the bus windows , but here it was difficult even to see well .
neutral	the guides and driver were awesome people , though , i really_enjoyed their tour .
neutral	my package arrived 0 days late .
neutral	and it was barely sealed .
neutral	it had nearly been completely been opened .
neutral	i was amazed all my product was still in the box
neutral	i can understand that you need to add the publicity but it is difficult what you have booked as it is tiny in a corner or in the middle of the advertisement .
neutral	it would be easier to follow if you increase the size of the font for the booking .
neutral	it would be easier to follow and at the same time you can keep the advertisement that would not feel too invading .
neutral	i have not gotten my book yet because i had it shipped to my office not knowing it would take 00 days to receive .
neutral	ordered 0 / 00 and delivered 0 / 00 .
neutral	i have never seen a fedex shipment that traveled that long
neutral	i bought a black_cartridge and a color one .
neutral	the color one did not work .
neutral	the black did .
neutral	good choices of quality pet_foods , but prices not so favorable without the discount , and i simply do not want to get into ongoing deliveries .
neutral	i ordered the dress , which was great value and when it did turn up really beautiful and worth it . however it was delievered 0 days late which isn_'_t too bad but considering you pay £ 0 . 00 for delievery . boohoo don_'_t have a phone_number only an_email address and they don_'_t respond to emails quickly so if your package didn_'_t turn up their would be a big problem . overall i love the dress but am not sure if i would order from them again .
neutral	i ordered my costume with click & collect , which was said to arrive at my ' collection_point ' in 0 days - which it did , faultlessly .
neutral	however , the instructions of where to collect my costume from were something to do with debenhams .
neutral	so i went to debenhams , queued for their click & collect , only to be told that giving my full name wasn_'_t enough and that i needed my order number .
neutral	i went away to wifi on my phone , so i could access the confirmation_email .
neutral	when i returned after queuing again they told me they didn_'_t have my order , and suggested i went to the shopping centre '_s info desk .
neutral	i did , and a woman finally directed me to an obscure place , where the locker was .
neutral	finally i received my costume !
neutral	love the jumpers , but bought a new one in response to deal for a 00_%_discount , the voucher_code would not work and i was charged full price .
neutral	i sent an immediate email and received no refund and no reply at all
neutral	when i received my order , it was for the european version of the item that i wanted .
neutral	i am in the us .
neutral	the customer_service rep that i made the order with did not return my phone_calls or email regarding the mix up on the delivery .
neutral	i called and was able to get in touch with another rep and he took_care of everything .
neutral	thank_you for all of your help ron johnson !
neutral	i work with lots of vendors with beautiful clothing and by_far ami_club have the longest processing and shipping ever ..
neutral	great deals which i love and buy all the time but after having some problems will my phone it bought 0 of the same thing .
neutral	i have emailed the returns department at_least 0 times over the past 0_weeks and heard_nothing !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a side_mirror for my saturn ion 0000 .
neutral	side_mirror came intact but you would have not thought so when laying eyes on the box .
neutral	it was so broken and mangled i thought the mirror was broke for sure .
neutral	gladly it wasnt , other than crappy shipping people it was a good deal .
neutral	i purchased some black and colour printer_cartridges for my hp b000a .
neutral	the delivery time was excellent , as i received the products the very next_day .
neutral	however , i am not entirely_satisfied with the ink quality , especially the coloured cartridges .
neutral	the black seems to work fine , but even_though the ink levels are saying ' full ', often the pink and blue colours are priniting very light and faded , almost like it is out of ink .
neutral	i have cleaned my print head by the prompt on my machine , but when i am printing a document this is still happening .
neutral	easy to use , clear_descriptions , somewhat fast results
neutral	i bought a crochet dress which was supposed to be 000_% cotton .
neutral	it arrived quickly , however , only the top smock bit of the dress seemed to be cotton , the main lower part felt and looked more synthetic and the lining was definitely synthetic .
neutral	it is true that boohoo have a good returns_policy , so i could have sent the dress back .
neutral	the measurements were for the outer edges of the bag ( barely ) not the inside dimensions of the bag .
neutral	also so thin a seam there was no width at all .
neutral	buy a bigger_size then what you think you need .
neutral	the bags were color accurate and did arrive quickly .
neutral	the backpack i ordered was a lovely product which my daughter enjoyed using for the first 0 months , until it started to fall_apart .
neutral	she used it for heavy schoolbooks and does not think the backpack i ordered was strong_enough to support the heavy weight but , was still disappointed to find that her new favourite backpack would not last her the whole year .
neutral	the frame could be a little moe sturdy .
neutral	envirophone were good but the reminders that kept sending me about sending the phone even_though it had been sent were irritating !
neutral	everything was delayed because of christmas .
neutral	i got a trip on trip_advisor to see my daughter out in phoenix and it was very expensive !
neutral	well i ordered a product , did not show out of stock on the website , to my dismay i was not contacted to let_me know it was out of stock .
neutral	so i was so excited to get my package and then be let_down because then and only then was i aware it was out of stock ... but i got an eyeliner .. wow !!?!?
neutral	!.. i '_m being scarcastic !
neutral	!
neutral	still_waiting in the refund to be credited_back on my account ; it '_s been almost a month !
neutral	very happy with the price and the car_rental , great car and very convenient , but there was some_confusion with the booking as it hadn_'_t come through complete with the price we had booked at when we got to the car_rental desk .
neutral	i was in a meeting when the call came through so i phoned back later , and spoke with a lady , who was extremely nice .
neutral	she was very helpful , although there was a certain_amount of confusion over payments that i actually made , and what was not necessary .
neutral	i can understand the need for all of the questions from my perspective , after all it is my loan , however to try and give my guarantor financial advice was unacceptable .
neutral	my guarantor was most aggreived by the level of intrusion into his financial_situation and as was correctly stated , the obligation falls to me to pay .
neutral	if i fail that is the only time that a financial burden will be placed upon my guarantor , if that ever occured then a review of my guarantor '_s situation should be taken , not prior .
neutral	just open this parcel .
neutral	very clear for me that price is always is determination of quality . no exception . box itself is in bad condition shape . i would be not surprise if i bought it from private party , but if company provides such poor quality product - ....
neutral	one filter has seal strap partionally detached from the body .
neutral	if its nor fitted well ( i plan to replace it coming weekend ) will return with seller '_s expense .
neutral	however , the bunch of flowers were far too small for the price charged .
neutral	after one week our sectional has a huge hole with the stuffing falling out .
neutral	we had paid for the warranty so we called them and they said it is only a one time fix on something that we did to the couch and not something that they can take_care of .
neutral	freight had me email pics and tell them what side the defect is on and it has_been a week so i '_m not sure what is going on right now .
neutral	i plan to call today .
neutral	when service fee is more than a couple of dollars , that '_s too much .
neutral	placed my order quickly and easily online .
neutral	i set_up scheduled_shipments of dog_food .
neutral	it was shipped immediately and got here sooner_than_expected , which was great !!
neutral	however , the bag had an 0 inch tear down the side that had been taped up to some extent .
neutral	it '_s a really long gash and i wonder_how much spilled out before it was taped up !
neutral	i was given the web address to get $_00 . 00 off my first order .
neutral	i connected and placed my order by was denyed the $_00 . 00 because i would not go auromatic delivery .
neutral	whether my 0 dogs like , love or otherwise isn_'_t even part of it .
neutral	the company should have given me the the discount without restrictions .
neutral	excellent service , record of past orders and delivery very efficient .
neutral	the first time i called for rates and availability i was told there were only 0 rooms left at that price of $_000 . 00 and no other rooms available at other prices .
neutral	i told the young_lady i would check with my sister and call back within 00_minutes or so .
neutral	i called back spoke to a gentlemen and was told there were only 0 rooms left after i reserved mine .
neutral	since other family_members were planning on booking suites as well i called them immediately .
neutral	they did not book until the following_day without a problem however they booked 0 suites .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why they felt they had to tell me that to book it by saying there were only 0 left and then 0 .
neutral	i would have booked anyway .
neutral	if that '_s a way to get people to book with the marriot residence inn i feel that '_s unfair and not real happy with it .
neutral	i hope my experience will be better when i actually get their .
neutral	if not i will certainly let you know .
neutral	my nephew and niece have stayed their many_times in the past so we do give you business .
neutral	sincerely ,
neutral	barbara rich
neutral	i have experienced some merchants not honouring vouchers or changing deal when you arrive or simply not being available to receive your booking
neutral	i ordered my books on the 00th and didn_'_t receive them till the 00th .
neutral	plus they ended_up having to cancel one of the books i wanted because it was no_longer available that should have been determined before they took the money out of my account so i didn_'_t have to wait for a refund .
neutral	had to wait for the money to be refunded before i could get my book from a different site and i received that book from the other site before i received my bookbyte books
neutral	i think your clothing is stylist and affordable !
neutral	your sales manager at cloverdale mall is very unpleasant !
neutral	would go more often if she would use some people skills !
neutral	other people think the same . the same .
neutral	my plants came alive but had been tumbled from shipping .
neutral	dirt was everywhere and it was not fun cleaning up the mess !!!
neutral	i hope my plants will survive .
neutral	:( :( :(
neutral	i paid you $_00 . 00 for a toilet riser with handles and it did not fit any toilet i tried to install it on .
neutral	there was very little information on this product .
neutral	implied it fit all toilets .
neutral	this was the most_important item i ordered due to the fact that my mother is almost unable to have much mobility and has a very time rising from the toilet .
neutral	very disappointed in this product .
neutral	will not use your service again .
neutral	the items sent were not from the same manufacturer nor did the packaging match what was pictured on the website .
neutral	am hopeful that it will work on the application for which it was bought .
neutral	making a reservation thru_travelocity was very easy .
neutral	problem was that i planned to make cash payment at the hotel .
neutral	once i checked in an informed the hotel that i planned to pay cash , i was informed that i couldn_'_t because the charge to my credit_card has already been processed and there was not way for them to change it .
neutral	have ordered several items from this shop online due to their excellent discount offers , however even my first purchase arrived missing items , it was an extreme smock by montane but had no crotch strap supplied as it should .... it had taken a week to arrive even_though royal_mail calls this service express00 , laughable at best , my other purchases have been slow as well and often sit around in the royal_mail hub for quite some time ..... seems a pity that a shop offering such good deals should have such a lousy delivery service ...... gave 0_stars for the deals offerd , would give no stars for the missing item and the delivery system .
neutral	if you are not local to milton_keynes and want something in a hurry i would hesitate to order from them is my advice ....
neutral	takes a really long time to confirm cashback and some payments simply don_'_t get tracked .
neutral	..
neutral	i wouldn_'_t create myself the hassle of chasing it so it '_s wasted .
neutral	really you need to improve .
neutral	products are good quality , however i received unpleasant customer_service each time !
neutral	very polite over the phone promising they '_ll get back to you but it has never happened .
neutral	my account stopped_working since they '_ve changed to maxishop from maximuscle ; i had £_00 worth of points that vanished , nobody got back to me as_promised so decided to forget about , created a new account instead .
neutral	i gave them 0 *** because i '_m happy with the products , however the protein_shakes taste awful , but most of proteins powders are not very nice anyway .
neutral	i prefer to buy their products most of the time from amazon , better service xx
neutral	my order of 000_litres was not delivered as there was insufficient oil on the tanker !
neutral	all i got was 000_litres .
neutral	i was angry as the supplier said there was nothing they could do and refused to take_responsibility for it .
neutral	it would have been a different story if i had failed to pay the full_amount to the supplier !
neutral	i complained to boilerjuice who refunded the difference but i had to actually ask for some compensation before they gave_me £ 0 off my next order .
neutral	i believe their prices are fair and good shipping and i '_m happy with them for the most part .
neutral	however i know this is most_likely my fault but they could enhance their account system because i had a double order because i had two accounts under my name .
neutral	i was not happy on paying for two orders right_away because it was not in my budget and other areas of my budget had to suffer .
neutral	i work long hours , and do lots of shopping online on the weekends .
neutral	i am used to shopping on many websites .
neutral	i think vetrxdirect site , while cute to look at , is very touchy and difficult to use , especially while ordering multiple items for multiple dogs .
neutral	i have also found things i normally order out of stock , while lots of stock exists at the competitors .
neutral	i think the pricing is better_than the others , but it doesn_'_t help me if there is no stock .
neutral	also , most other comapnies will honor the competitor '_s price if they can verify it .
neutral	the folks who work there are very nice , and have helped_me when i have struggled to work with their website .
neutral	nutshell : prices are good , and people are nice .
neutral	website is difficult , and stock conditions are sporadic .
neutral	i ordered a iphone 0 orange unlock in early june , expecting the available unlock max 00 days_later ...
neutral	after a very long waiting ( a big month ) still no news , so i decided to send a pay back email .
neutral	they told me i '_ll be totally refund for the inconvenience but when i asked why the unlock couldn_'_t be done , they finally sent me the unlocking process email .
neutral	it works_perfectly so i '_m very happy but it is a pity they couldn_'_t get it any faster .
neutral	i really love my ring but this is the second time in less_than two years that a diamond has fallen out of the setting .
neutral	it is a pain to send it back each time for it to be fixed so now i end up paying out of pocket to have it fixed near my home .
neutral	it makes me wish i had purchased my stone and setting at a store near me .
neutral	frames were reasonable but did find deeper discount on frames at another site after i had placed the order .
neutral	having_trouble adjusting to this pair of progressives , the mid distance is difficult if not impossible to find and the distance vision is a little off too .
neutral	using them primarily now for near vision at work only .
neutral	left lens also a little squeaky and hoping it won_'_t fall out contacted customer_service about this but they never got back to me .
neutral	not sure i would order progressive rx lenses from them again but maybe frames and lined bifocals .
neutral	i ordered a littmann_stethoscope that was supposed to be purple but it looks like a dark blue .
neutral	i am not thrilled and especially_since i paid $_00 for it .
neutral	i expected it to be the right color .
neutral	it took_ages .
neutral	every time i tried to do it , ít seemed to go in circles and send me back to the start , and say submit a review , epecially difficult on a phone .
neutral	wouldn_'_t have bothered but i wanted to support the place i stayed
neutral	i was really happy with everything about my shopping_experience with fabriah . com apart_from one thing .
neutral	when my product arrived , the plastic pump part of my shampoo was broken into little sharp pieces .
neutral	although it had been wrapped in bubble_wrap , it obviously hadn_'_t been protected sufficiently .
neutral	maybe the fault of the courier used / royal_mail but this is obviously disappointing as a consumer .
neutral	in terms of everything else when shopping with fabriah . com - very happy .
neutral	quality of products and prices - great .
neutral	website - easy to use .
neutral	communication about delivery - fab .
neutral	if they address this issue i would definitely buy products from them again and recommend them to family and friends .
neutral	i ordered this for a birthday_gift for one of my daughters and it was unable to be delivered to her address for some_reason .... it did arrive at my home which is great ..... i now need to send it to her again ..... her_birthday will_continue on .....
neutral	bed is comfortable , easy to erect , easy to pack away single handed , it '_s wide and lightweight , but the carry bag was very disappointing ., and therefore brought the rating down .
neutral	bag not only is paper thin providing little protection but there is no handle or shoulder_strap .
neutral	how is it portable ?
neutral	and how can you call it a carry bag ?
neutral	so , the book i received in the mail was in worse condition than i wanted it to be in .
neutral	the problem was with the packaging .
neutral	the person_who delivered a book ( which was placed in a large usps_priority_mail envelope ) shoved it into a mailbox cubby .
neutral	i spent 00_minutes trying to pull it out of the cubby .
neutral	literally , the person_who delivered it rolled up a large paperback book and shoved it into a small cubby .
neutral	so naturally the packaging and the book was a bit more damaged when i received it .
neutral	we ordered the lion squeaky toy for our dog and once again it took him less_than two minutes to rip out two of the squeakers .
neutral	so frustrating .
neutral	we live in the country and as petflow only uses fedex to deliver and they won_'_t deliver to us .
neutral	they go so_far and mail it the rest of the way .
neutral	because of this i probably will not order from petflow again .
neutral	pub storage took over another storage_space where the people had been much_nicer and accomodating .
neutral	the ankle_brace that i bought is flimsy on bottom , the ankle_support seems great .
neutral	not sure my son will wear it .
neutral	i thought it would be more snug , but the bottom just flaps .
neutral	delivery was very quick at no charge , so very happy with that .
neutral	we still have not received our corrected profile that we were suppose to receive when we purchased the anuity several_months_ago .
neutral	it was supposed to have been sent w_/ our contract .
neutral	we were suppose to get it back in january .
neutral	please send it .
neutral	also , could you send me a link where i can tract the current performance of our anuity .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	< private_data_removed_> was very helpfull getting the profile corrected , but she said another dept .
neutral	had to send it to us .
neutral	we booked our stay for cancun around new years and had an amazing customer_service experience !
neutral	we originally_booked for the bahamas , but changed our mind less_than a day later and chose to visit cancun for our_honeymoon .
neutral	however , when i recently booked a hotel in las_vegas for my bachelorette , we forgot to apply coupon mgm00 at checkout .
neutral	we called less_than a minute after confirmation and were connected to a customer_service agent .
neutral	he was mediocre - at best .
neutral	he wasn_'_t understanding at all , and when i asked if he could honor the coupon , he told me it was already a great deal , inferring that the $_00 and an_additional_$_00 food credit was minor .
neutral	i was frustrated , and he told me there '_s nothing he could do .
neutral	he kept restating the same thing , so i just gave up and cancelled my reservation online , then rebooked it with the coupon .
neutral	i was out the $_00 . 00 for cancelling my hotel , but at_least i was still able to save $_00 and get a food credit ( which , no_matter_how good of a deal it already was , i still thought made a huge_difference in value ).
neutral	anyway , out of the two experiences , my experience with booking cancun was awesome , so i won_'_t forget the great customer_service i received !
neutral	however , the second service agent could use some additional training , or he shouldn_'_t be in customer_service .
neutral	you need to be a little more understanding if " helping " people is your job .
neutral	i loved the prices on the items .
neutral	even_though i paid equal amount on shipping , the price was still great !
neutral	i wore one pair of my boots yesterday and they looked awesome .
neutral	however , today i pulled out the other pair and they were severely damaged .
neutral	now , i have to through the return process .
neutral	i will shop them again in spite of the defective boot - unless it '_s a common occurrence .
neutral	i used silver_shuttle for my ride to heathrow_airport .
neutral	the service overall wasn_'_t bad .
neutral	i used the shared service , which_meant i shared a ride with another customer going to the same location .
neutral	i booked it for 0am and received a message from them stating that my driver would be there at 0 . 00am .
neutral	i think that they ask customers to be flexible with the booking , so i was kinda expecting a different time .
neutral	but then the driver turned_up at 0 . 00 am instead and i wasn_'_t quite ready .
neutral	early is usually a good thing , but not on this occasion .
neutral	it was so annoying .
neutral	then we went to pick_up the other customer and the driver looked like he didn_'_t know where she lived .
neutral	then the customer also said to the driver that she wasn_'_t expecting him so early .
neutral	i give them a thumbs_up for at_least getting me to the airport and also sending a clean , spacious car but the above experience let it down a little .
neutral	overall , i would still use the service , but i ' d probably have to talk things through with the management before booking .
neutral	or i may just used another cab service that i recently found which only charges £ 0 extra for a private cab .
neutral	the product was great but we are still_waiting for a pass - code for the windows 0 application we paid for as a part of the deal .
neutral	we keep being told it is on the disc case - but it definitely isn_'_t and now the trial_period has run_out - so we don_'_t have windows 0 .
neutral	not very happy :-(
neutral	i almost booked this a few_times but stopped when i read all the small small_print on the ' more info ' page that went on about bringing cash in an envelope with your registration_number written on it .
neutral	this left me feeling
neutral	a ) ripped_off .. extra costs hidden in small_print and
neutral	b ) like it '_s such a lot of hassle - when you book this kind of service to be hassle_free .
neutral	it '_s a petty amount of money - just include it and advertise it as including all hidden parking charges and it will be appealing to people for that reason .
neutral	i revisited it because you sent me the 0 %_off offer - but to be honest there are a number of these services available ( i '_ve used them all ) and the prices all vary from day to day and i could just as easily have booked one of those if the prices worked out - so the 0 % deal was in no way enough to bring me back .
neutral	it doesn_'_t even cover one of the 0 hidden car_park charges .
neutral	i still have no_intention of locating an envelope and writing my registration on it etc .
neutral	[ updated after reply entered on 00 / 00 / 0000_]
neutral	you advertise a service - the customer doesn_'_t ( and shouldn_'_t have to ) care whether you ' re an agency or not - that '_s your issue .
neutral	any valet service at stansted will now incur this cost and you can absolutely advertise it as such .
neutral	you should charge the extra money and the drivers should take_care of the payment .
neutral	if you refuse to get involved in that then the minimum you should do is put " plus car_park access charges and booking fee " in the prices advertised .
neutral	otherwise it is false_advertising .
neutral	trying to obtain telephone verification was stressful .
neutral	it took several_attempts to accomplish this part .
neutral	you offered two choices landline or mobile but you only responded to the mobile by sending at text_message .
neutral	i suggest that you inform customers that they should give their mobile number so that you can send a text .
neutral	though you said you could call , no call came for either landline or mobile , otherwise everything else was satisfactory .
neutral	i think the bargains are remarkable , but having to buy a certain_amount in dollars is not clear until checkout .
neutral	also , i placed a order two_weeks_ago or more , and when i checked on it recently , i was told that it hadn_'_t even been picked_up for shipment .
neutral	the order had to be placed again , and i still don_'_t have it .
neutral	when i requested that some small items be added , i was told it couldn_'_t be done .
neutral	i also offered to pay the shipping on a small order , and that was also denied .
neutral	all the phone reps have been congenial and accommodating , however .
neutral	as a technical recruiter , i have been using ziprecruiter for about a year now ... i find the ability to post a position within their site and their cross posting is wonderful and the social networking linking is also good .
neutral	there is room for improvement !
neutral	job_postings ... would like to see the formatting when cutting and pasting from a word or rtf document to remain in proper format .
neutral	when linking your job_postings to your social_networks especially linkedin . com , i would like to see it pull your groups into a drop down selection ... it is very hard to remember all the groups your are a member of when linking .
neutral	when posting a job , would like to see a way for a candidate is disqualified from applying due to non_- citizenship or requires sponsorship to be blocked ... it is a waste of time if you do not sponsor h0b visas .
neutral	daily 0 - 00 candidates require sponsorship .
neutral	search resumes well , this could use a great amount of improvement .
neutral	text resume the format is often unreadable due to distortion of the formatting ... it is just to many steps to review a candidates resume .. why not just pull up the formatted resume instead of going thru so many steps ... it is time_consuming .
neutral	would like to see some advance search capabilities to narrow your search efforts especially if interested in relocating and citizenship .
neutral	i am passionate_about recruiting and i am all about the ease of functionality and productivity .
neutral	i think ziprecruiter could be a fabulous product and i am hoping it gets there !
neutral	my order arrived_promptly but someone got the order wrong in some respects .
neutral	okay , that happens .
neutral	then i called to correct it , offering to send back the unordered treats .
neutral	i was very kindly told to keep them and the right stuff would be sent .
neutral	nope .
neutral	still not right .
neutral	but too much_trouble to continue .
neutral	the dogs love the treats and will enjoy them just fine .
neutral	the niceness of those i spoke with obviously went a long way .
neutral	can you get your suppliers to be sure to indicate where the product come from ?
neutral	my order was made in the usa ( which i wanted to be sure about ) but it didn_'_t say that on the label .
neutral	i have no_issues with the product , but we received no positive effects from using it .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	location to far from my house , but rates were cheaper for size unit .
neutral	so no big deal
neutral	i think the clothes are fair - good they could improve by catering for larger_sizes a lot more , not just the 00 '_s - 00 '_s but the 00 00 00 00 and 00 sizes too as most shops do now .
neutral	i think the shoes are great and for the money you can expect very good quality , however there is one thing that stops me from ordering on a daily_basis and that is the postage .
neutral	it is crazy to pay £ 0 for a small key_ring but then £ 0 . 00 postage , same as a scarf that costs just 00p to send !
neutral	i think you could improve this by doing what most companies do and that is to charge a set amount for how ever many items you purchase , for example £ 0 . 00 for any amount of items be it one scarf or 00 pairs of shoes , that would be a fair price as that is what very , asos , next , etc all charge and smaller companies too that sell items in ebay , one price no_matter_how much you order .
neutral	anyway overall a great site with a reasonable amount of choice and nice quality .
neutral	i understand that mistakes are made sometimes , but when i call customer_service or send in a request regarding a mistake that the company made i expect to speak with someone within a few hours if not right_away .
neutral	it has_been almost 00_hours since i have addressed the wrong part being sent to me and i still have yet to speak with anyone .
neutral	i tried to call the phone_number for customer_service and they no_longer offer customer_service via phone ... how convenient .
neutral	the prices on the website are great , but customer_service surely needs to get it together .
neutral	order was ok , but dealing_with cust service putting in a ticket for your issue takes days to resolve .
neutral	and the resolve was pointed back to it being my fault - not .
neutral	wrong answer .
neutral	also when ordering alot of personalized cards its a timely process .
neutral	the computer kept requiring input of personal information too often .
neutral	process was streamlined and not complicated .
neutral	we received an e_- mail about a recent fare sale , and tried to book two round_trip tickets at the same time ; we were only able to finalize one ticket at the advertised price , then had to book the second ticket at a higher price .
neutral	i loved the food that i liked .
neutral	i '_m very picky and can '_t eat some foods .
neutral	about a third of the menu was still really great .
neutral	with the ability to customize , i should have been very happy every week .
neutral	the problem was the constant replacement .
neutral	i would plan out my whole week , but then some of it would be replaced .
neutral	my last_week out of 00 meals - 00 were replacements that i did not want .
neutral	that '_s over 00_% of my meals for the week !
neutral	customer_service is very nice but not very helpful .
neutral	i asked about replacements , refunds , something - and got no help - 0 different weeks .
neutral	i was told that they couldn_'_t promise what they would have on hand every week .
neutral	then why is it on the my menu for the week ?
neutral	the actual menu for the week wasn_'_t released until after the order was shipped - after which they will not help .
neutral	i wasn_'_t allowed to send it back , refuse it , or get a refund .
neutral	if only my menu was actually my menu , i would still be a customer .
neutral	i loved the site - easy to use , and found my product quickly .
neutral	cheap , and got my package way sooner_than i anticipated .
neutral	but , when i got the tape i purchased all three rolls were stained .
neutral	it looked like someone spilled pink juice all over the white tape i ' d purchased .
neutral	it works ok ... but i can tell it '_s not as sticky as i ' d like .
neutral	so , the product was meh , but service was good .
neutral	may or may not buy again ... as i '_m almost out of the tape since i ' d had to throw_away a nice portion of the stained stuff .
neutral	good products and competitive_prices but despatch dates can be little slower_than shown at point of sale .
neutral	unless u pay for the delivery it can be slow often taking a week to receive goods .
neutral	lucky they use royal_mail so i can pick_up from sorting_office if not home for delivery !
neutral	i got this service thinking that it was a good deal with the dsl internet and the phone combined .
neutral	the whole setup process over the phone was kind of extensive and i '_m sure we discussed that i used internet for gaming and streaming videos , email , etc .
neutral	however , after i get the service and set it up , it runs somewhat slowly and on technical_support call with at & t after my modem just stops working for my computer , i am told that the service i have is not at all recommended for use with video streaming , which i have been using it for with netflix .
neutral	i am disappointed with the service that i got and the fact that it can '_t be upgraded because of the area that i am located in .
neutral	i wish that it would have been clearly_stated that my service would be somewhat slow and not beneficial for what i needed it for .
neutral	the phone service is fine so_far , with the telemarketing calls that start after beginning new phone service .
neutral	i sincerely hope that i '_m not locked into a 0 - year contract so that after my lease ends next year , i still won_'_t be stuck with this sub - par internet service and speed .
neutral	the online booking process is very easy to use , but good luck if you need to make any changes to an existing reservation .
neutral	the system usually tells you that you can '_t make_changes on the site and you have to call customer_service .
neutral	then customer_service wants to charge you for having a rep help you and you have to prove to them that the system didn_'_t allow you to make_changes by sending them a screen_shot of the error_message you received .
neutral	they won_'_t just take your word for it , they want you to prove it , which is unacceptable .
neutral	they also use call centers in regions that don_'_t necessarily speak_english as a first language , which can make communication difficult .
neutral	overall , the problems get resolved eventually , but too much time is spent when you can '_t make the changes yourself online .
neutral	took the shipping that cost more to ensure the cards would be here on time .
neutral	said they would arrive between 00 / 00 / 0000 through 00 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	today is the 00rd and still no cards .
neutral	did find website very user_friendly .
neutral	already bought electric gold 00 lights loved them , but these battery lights were more yellow than the warm gold and really not enough lights on there .
neutral	i wish this product worked in my nespresso pixie for several reasons_: the price , the quickness of delivery , and the amazing customer_service when i had a problem .
neutral	unfortunately , the product needs to be tweaked because it didn_'_t work in my nespresso_machine at all :( my machine wouldn_'_t or couldn_'_t punch through the top of the capsules and made my machine stop dead .
neutral	please fix this so i can use your product !!
neutral	!
neutral	the product was exactly_what i was looking for but it took about 0_weeks to get .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it was due to the weather or not it just took to long for me to get what i ordered .
neutral	i love the prices but most of the items are in small or small and medium .
neutral	it '_s frustrating when you see something you like and go to the page and see that it only comes in small ... or certain shoe_sizes
neutral	the sizing is a bit off to hoodies ive baught else where at 00 / 00 ... first one ive had to get a 00 in before and could prob stand a size_bigger for the baggy look .
neutral	not the most flattering fit but that is most_likely the colour .
neutral	web team were great when asking about changing it in a shop .
neutral	trafford centre team not so great , got the criminal feeling as it was given the full once over .
neutral	courier service excellent .
neutral	however not so good when i requested the name of the recipient for my parcel as they said it had not been received .
neutral	i emailed customers services on 0 . 0 . 00 asking for the name of the recipient .
neutral	i was emailed a document from the courier with the signature which was totally unrecognisable .
neutral	i then said i really wanted the name of the person_who received the parcel .
neutral	i was told that interparcel would get back on to the courier and get the name .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a reply .
neutral	as it happened i took the matter up direct with the company i sent the parcel to and resolved the matter .
neutral	however i am disappointed that i paid for a signature which was unreadable .
neutral	i suggest that the couriers in the future also write down the name of the recipient .
neutral	i found website easy to use and to understand .
neutral	however , when i came to pay it was credit_card with charges or paypal .
neutral	i elected for paypal which i have used before and it would not accept it .
neutral	i checked everything on paypal to the extent of setting it up again !
neutral	i decided to see what would happen if i used my credit_card and as soon as the number was in - before i pressed another key - it was accepted and so i paid with excess charges .
neutral	why could i not have used a debit_card ?
neutral	everything else perfect .
neutral	would use again if this niggle is sorted_out .
neutral	it was easy to order from your website .
neutral	i have still not received the item i bought on 0rd jan .
neutral	i love getting gift_cards here but sometimes there is a time_consuming delay during checkout .
neutral	the verification process of gift_cards states it can take up to 0 minutes and the wheel will just keep spinning , even past 0 minutes .
neutral	i can refresh the page several_times with the same results !
neutral	there should be a ukash voucher for more than 00 dollars .
neutral	some items i would like to purchase are almost 000_dollars , and since you can only get 0 voucher at a time , i have to wait almost a week to purchase something more than 00 dollars .
neutral	the activation_fee for ukash is way to high .
neutral	i limit the amount of times i use this because of that .
neutral	i ordered extension tubing for a hollister leg drainage bag .
neutral	in the picture , the tubing was round .
neutral	this is exactly_what i was looking for , as my supply company sends me tubing that is flat - shaped and it often kinks .
neutral	well , that is the tubing i ended_up receiving from express med .
neutral	if that is the only tubing that is available now , then the picture needs to be updated .
neutral	first time i have used this website and was ok unfortunately the hotel was not .
neutral	they said they had problems with their rooms and they were booking me into another hotel a 00_min drive away .
neutral	got there and they said they knew nothing about me or the other couple who were also being moved .
neutral	awesome driver sorted it out for us .
neutral	not happy i had a room accessed by a lot of stairs in a basement with no window even_though i had special requested a room avoiding stairs because of my bad knee making stairs difficult .
neutral	protested to the person taking my case for me but he said i could ask to be moved and carried on taking my case downstairs .
neutral	having already lost an_hour of my evening and already being 0 flights of stairs down to the basement i could not face the aggrevation of re - climbing the stairs .
neutral	room was nice and clean but got those stairs to climb in the morning :(
neutral	product was fine but i was never sent an_email_confirming delivery .
neutral	also , the gentleman that answered the phone seemed lost and had no information on if my order shipped or not .
neutral	selection is better_than a store , but the try - on feature is limited , so not being_able to see the frames ahead of time makes ordering a gamble , especially with the return_policy .
neutral	also , the order took a loooong time to process , more than a month .
neutral	the product seems fine , nothing i couldn_'_t have gotten at costco , frankly , despite fancy name - brand frames .
neutral	also , filing with insurance was an extra step that took more time to figure_out , do , and get the check .
neutral	i like the selection , but i don_'_t think my next pair of glasses will come from this site .
neutral	it '_s good , although i think they rip you off with some games .
neutral	once you '_ve sent your games it takes ages to actually get them approved and the money eventually sent to you .
neutral	i got a decent rate and it was easy to book , however , when i received my email_confirmation , all it said was my marriott hotel was booked .
neutral	i '_m not even certain i '_ve reserved my nights at the right hotel , although the photo looks like it .
neutral	how difficult would it be to put the specific hotel name and contact information on the reservation ?
neutral	good place to order the only_thing i found with the shoes they run smaller then the original size .
neutral	that should be mentioned in their shoe dept regarding the flip_flops ,
neutral	i had a tough start you guys as it took a lot longer to set_up than i had expected .
neutral	my first payment went missing and i tried emailing and calling but no one could / would help so i am now down $_000 but besides for that everything has_been alright .
neutral	i would recommend to others that need to pay their student_loan
neutral	my first ordering experience with petflow was okay , but not great .
neutral	i emailed the cs department a question about a coupon , but they never responded .
neutral	the order arrived in a timely_fashion , but the box of kitty_litter had broken open and was all over the bottom of the shipping box .
neutral	what a mess !
neutral	petflow offers convenience and decent prices , but their service could be improved .
neutral	i don_'_t like the way you show your orders and no tracking #'_s to check out whats going on .
neutral	but the prices are good .
neutral	recently while strolling through town i saw an ad on a bus " multitrip_insurance " for as little as 00 . 00 yo yos .
neutral	hmmmmmmmmmmm
neutral	that sounds like its too good to be true i thought .
neutral	and so it was ...... logged on and guess what ? i ended_up paying over 00 yo yos for something advertised as 00 . 00 .
neutral	bit disappointing .
neutral	the ordering and payment went fine .
neutral	unfortunately , when the company sent me my plaques they did not include my name on the package address .
neutral	my post_office does not accept packages without names so they sent it back .
neutral	because of this mess - up i did not have the plaques for the event where i needed them which was extremely frustrating .
neutral	so_far , i am noticing that i am not able to access notices that you have sent me regarding activity on my account .
neutral	what '_s the purpose of having something like this if it won_'_t show what '_s going on .
neutral	it just stuck with a blank page and i finally gave up .
neutral	will probably call when i get a chance .
neutral	items were as_pictured on the website but in person , the quality was pretty poor .
neutral	polyester dresses aren_'_t really that nice to wear , even if they look very pretty .
neutral	i rented a 00 x 00 which turned_out to be 0 0 x 0 '_s with the center wall taken out but by doing that it gave_me a 00 x 00 with two doors that needed locks instead of one roll up door .
neutral	i had to pay 00 . 00 for one lock and 00 . 00 for the other lock .
neutral	i should have only had to pay for one lock .
neutral	nit picky but it showed little consideration for the person renting .
neutral	for the cost of the item not worth the price .
neutral	i found it very difficult to navigate placing the order .
neutral	at no point did i find a site that allowed you to view the whole order , plus details when the flowers will be delivered , etc .
neutral	this is my first experience ordering myself on the pc .
neutral	normally i go through my local_florist .
neutral	i just hope , fingers_crossed , that the right order will be delivered at the right time to the right address .
neutral	when we showed_up at the airport , they did not have our reserved vehicle available , however for a $_00 a day upcharge , they could find another vehicle .
neutral	we felt trapped so we agreed .
neutral	when we got to our vehicle , there was ' our original vehicle ' parked right next to our upgraded one .
neutral	after flying 00_hours we decided just to take it and go about our vacation .
neutral	very disappointed with the ' bait & switch '.
neutral	i usually use wag . com because they offer free overnight shipping , but recently i had to switch my dogs food and wag doesn_'_t offer the new brand so i went looking for a new delivery service .
neutral	i stumbled_upon pet_flow and was happy to find that they offer the brand i was looking for .
neutral	i ordered the food on aug 00 and they said it ' d ship on the 00st .
neutral	i was happy .
neutral	but it didn_'_t ship until a week_later taking two_weeks for the first half of the order and another couple days for the second half .
neutral	maybe i '_m spoiled by wag . com but i wasn_'_t super happy with how long it took to get the food .
neutral	plus , the site isn_'_t super user_friendly so i think i '_m going to go looking again .
neutral	service great but felt_like i was giving my books away .
neutral	not sure it was worth the money .
neutral	site very good - however my only bug bear this was my first order and as my husband and i work all day i wanted the goods delivered to my work address , but because this is my first order it had to delivered to my home address .
neutral	which as anyone_who works knows who works all day this presents it own problems .
neutral	but apart_from that i still ordered as it was way cheaper_than anyone_else .
neutral	i guess is not entirely wowcher '_s fault , but i think they should make_sure vendors are really reliable .
neutral	i always check reviews online now before buying anything , and i '_m used to see that for quite a few of them there don_'_t get many good reviews .
neutral	i '_m having_trouble with an item at the moment and i '_ve been trying to sort this out for a month .. frustrating :/
neutral	ordered slippers but can not get on the web_site to redeem will have to phone for help this was later resolved
neutral	i '_ve been calling your phone_number for two_weeks on hold entirely too long
neutral	i would have rated my purchase 0_stars , only not had it fitted yet .
neutral	my plumber is not available until september .
neutral	i only bought as i felt_pressured by better_bathrooms to buy during there 00 year sale , as prices would go up .
neutral	so i did .
neutral	only to find that nothing has changed , prices still the same , just called 00_%_off sale .
neutral	i know have a full bathroom_suite stored all over the house awaiting my plumber .
neutral	one criticism is , they will not delay the delivery to accomodate you .
neutral	once you have ordered , then they will deliver .
neutral	if i was in a rush , this would of been excelllent .
neutral	unfortunately this and the fact the 00 year sale was no more than pressure to get us to part with our money there and then has left me somewhat miffed .
neutral	i ordered my dog_food on a friday expecting to receive it by tues or wednesday .
neutral	when the dog_food did not arrive i looked up my order and tracking_number and found out that the food was due to arrive on friday .
neutral	well , i was leaving for vacation on friday and had to find a local_store that carried my dog '_s food and ask them to special order it for me for thurday . i also had to ask a friend to stop at my house and lug 00_lbs of dog_food inside for me .
neutral	when i emailed customer_service they apologized and told me that they were sorry but they didn_'_t have the dog_food in the closer warehouse and had to mail it from one further away .
neutral	if i had been notified of this i would have cancelled the order .
neutral	they also offered me a 00_% rebate on the food .
neutral	this is why i rated them a 0_star instead of a 0_star .
neutral	for the second time using this website , it was all good until i tried to pay , after_submitting about five times i finally got confirmation .
neutral	this happened on both_occasions and is worrying because you don_'_t know if you ' re being charged once or five times !
neutral	frustrating !
neutral	the collars were not very bright , i was kind of disappointed with that and 0 out of the 0 lights i purchased for on the collar didn_'_t work , but the one that did was nice and bright .
neutral	the charm i ordered is very lovely but i was disappointed that the padded_envelope and the inner box were both torn and broken - especially as i paid for special delivery .
neutral	as it was a gift i was not able to give it in the box which diminished the appearance .
neutral	if you want more customer , please make it more cheaper to call to countries like ethiopia .
neutral	i ordered one bag but somehow got two and it made no sense to me .
neutral	as a result i was charged for shipping even_though i paid for two large_bags .
neutral	not real happy about that .
neutral	recently i ordered love softball , item # a0000f .
neutral	it would not press onto the shirt for nothing !
neutral	that design was $ 0 . 00 plus the cost of my shirt .
neutral	another design was sassy talkin girl item # a0000f .
neutral	some of that design pilled off .
neutral	item # a0000c sun and fun youth was the same way .
neutral	i have made several other ones that have turned_out perfect and i love , but something was wrong with these few .
neutral	i don_'_t know if maybe they were old or what .
neutral	i was very disappointed .
neutral	ordered the brushes as they were cheaper_than going to oral_b .
neutral	they do a similar job but the brush is missing its brisstles in the middle of the brush which oral_b has .
neutral	so with molarclean the middle of the brush is empty .
neutral	the bristles feel slightly softer than oral_b .
neutral	good on the pocket but in the long run will be ordering from oral_b .
neutral	the website was great and very helpful !!!
neutral	unfortunately never got to purchase the item , because it was out of stock .
neutral	seeing that i should have been informed about the product being out of stock , before i push the purchase button .
neutral	( keep that in mind ).
neutral	but my credit_card was refunded swiftly ... so i did appreciate that , maybe in the near_future i can do_business , at this time it is still questionable ......???
neutral	?
neutral	i bought a disneystore discounted_gift_card , however , when i received it , it was a disneystore merchandise credit_card , total_waste of my money .
neutral	i had several problems with wimdu ; firstly they posted my details without my authorisation , then the guy dealing_with it had left so you get someone different answering you queries each time .
neutral	although i wasn_'_t particularly happy i stuck with it and had a decent response .
neutral	the people i have had to stay have all been lovely but wimdu penalise you if you refuse a booking which i think is ridiculous .
neutral	i have every right to choose who stays in my home and if someone puts in a last_minute request , it '_s not always possible .
neutral	if i have one more bad_experience i '_ll be leaving , sadly .
neutral	but could have done with unpacking my desk & taking cardboard with them
neutral	the ‘ free ’ boat_trip was superb .
neutral	the live_commentary was detailed , lively and very entertaining .
neutral	i found the buses confusing as the route each bus was on was not obvious and heavy_traffic made progress very slow .
neutral	we did not ever manage to get on one with a live_guide - i wonder what the ratio of taped to live is ?
neutral	the taped commentary on the bus was minimal with too much ‘ stirring ’ music filling the gaps .
neutral	i like the design and colors alot , but was disappointed to realize they were made of plastic and therefore have melted and the letters get distorted .
neutral	while the part was delivered when you said , it was the wrong part .
neutral	i ended_up going advanced_auto_parts and got the part cheaper ( less shipping !).
neutral	what do i need to do to send it back and get my money back ?
neutral	booking very quick and easy , even when the wrong tyres were booked i was contacted and the error was sorted .
neutral	at the garage every one was booked in at the same time , not a great experience seemed that they were too busy and as i did not know exactly_what my wheel nut was no real help and a fellow customer had to help me .
neutral	ok i should have thought through it but other fitters find it for me .
neutral	priceline bidding is great for getting good deals on hotels .
neutral	however , 0 - star that are dirty , rundown , and have scary clientele are within priceline guidelines .
neutral	you won_'_t get a refund from the hotel unless you stick around long enough to make a formal_complaint , and without that priceline won_'_t do a thing for you except a $_00 off a 0 - star .
neutral	key in my usual area is 0 - star .
neutral	you get a decent clean room with microwave usually and often fridge or kitchenette .
neutral	start bidding with 0 - stars just in case any are biting ;-).
neutral	had trouble loging in as it wouldn_'_t accept my e_- mail address which was and is valid despite what it kept saying .
neutral	i nearly gave up but persevered as i needed the magnets .
neutral	however once i ' d managed to login it was all very straight_forward .
neutral	magnets arrived_promptly and well_packaged .
neutral	i had high_hopes for the spoiled_rotten_box when i ordered it .
neutral	i had to call the company to complete my order because the site wouldn_'_t complete it .
neutral	i have three dogs , 0lbs , 00lbs and 000lbs .
neutral	being dachshunds and a german_shepherd dog , they are all ' power ' chewers !
neutral	i was truly disappointed that there wasn_'_t even one toy in the box .
neutral	there was 0 can of food , 0 roll of food , 0 box of calming treats , 0 pack of beef & cheddar treats , 0 pack of tiny ' brushless toothpaste ' treats , 0 spearmint star shaped chew , a key_chain and a silicone teddy_bear that you can bake or freeze treats in .
neutral	if i gave that to any of my dogs it would be destroyed in minutes !
neutral	all in all , $_00 for a selection of treats is really expensive .
neutral	i would have really liked at_least one toy .
neutral	it '_s helpful to seek out options , but i never find any actual bargains .
neutral	hi !
neutral	i really love this website but i had bad_experience and wasn_'_t one time , that '_s the worst part ...
neutral	long time ago ( more than a year ) i returned a pair of boots they told me that i had a credit store , after a wile i was trying to buy something and my credit store wasn_'_t there i sent an_email and they apologize and told that they will return the money to my bank acc i wrote back and told them that i don_'_t have that bank acc anymore but instead i want a credit store i want to buy stuffs , well they never respond to my emails and i sent many !
neutral	after that i keep buying because i like everything !!
neutral	well i need return 0 item ( was to big ) but they told me that i need a number or code , something like that but they never send me any code ( i was checking my email and my account in the webpage ) the time already_passed ( waiting ) and was only 00 days to returned the merchandise so i couldn_'_t do anything , after that i stop buying , they are very unprofessional !
neutral	!
neutral	shipping is a little_bit of a shock at first but if you watch what you order its not bad at all .
neutral	i ordered a 00_lb of blue_buffalo freedom and a little pack of dog_treats .
neutral	i received the dog_food in good shape , but the dog_treats were smashed by the heavy_bag of dog_food , so they were in crumbles .
neutral	i would suggest putting the dog_treats in a separate package inside the big box for the dog_food to protect the treat bag from getting crushed by the big bag of dog_food .
neutral	i tried multiple_times over multiple days to book online .
neutral	everytime i clicked ' bookit now ' it went back to the beginning and started me all over .
neutral	i ended_up having to call the toll_free number and although the gentleman was very nice and helpful , it took over an_hour to process my request .
neutral	then after it '_s all said and done , i get an_email 0 days_later saying the show i booked is not available on the day i booked it .
neutral	i '_m sure there will be more of that coming before my trip takes place .
neutral	not a happy customer .
neutral	very nervous as to what ' type ' of room i get at the pallazzo ….
neutral	i just worry it '_s going to be not what i ordered and paid for … i read a lot of comments where that '_s happened and the hotel blames it on bookit and won_'_t do anything for you .
neutral	nervous .
neutral	the shipping_costs way too much so only by from them if they are the last option .
neutral	it is often difficult to change an auto - order .
neutral	i have to then make a phone_call , so the convenience is gone .
neutral	to cancel an auto - order , you are directed to make a phone_call .
neutral	again , inconvenient .
neutral	the website encourages auto - orders , so i signed_up for them initially because of the promise of locked - in prices .
neutral	this was a false claim .
neutral	i booked on - line .
neutral	not until after indicating what i wanted size - wise and had moved at_least half - way through the process did i learn that the $ 0 move - in did not apply .
neutral	spoke to several other renters near me who had the same experience .
neutral	i was very pleased to find you could ship the iams premium protection dry_cat_food to me as i was not able to find these two varieties in pet_stores .
neutral	the order process was great ; the delivery was great ... but one of the items shipped was the wrong item .
neutral	i have called customer_support and they should be shipping the correct item .
neutral	as requested , i am sending back the upc code for credit from the incorrect item shipped .
neutral	i '_m hoping the replacement will arrive soon .
neutral	if it does , then i will be happy to report a very good experience with petflow .
neutral	the reservations transaction was fine , however , i am very upset that it wasn_'_t explained to me that i was dealing_with a third_party .
neutral	i was under the impression i was talking with hampton_inn reservations .
neutral	when i questioned my hilton points , your rep told me to discuss that with the hotel when i checked in .
positive	my machine was delivered timely with clear_instructions and lots of samples !
positive	i have been getting steady orders and the machine has not failed me !
positive	thanks !
positive	full service that i really appreciate .
positive	great job !
positive	but you have a really good service , thank_you .
positive	came fast and the goods were not damaged .
positive	when i ordered kitty_litter from petco , the boxes were ripped apart and litter got everywhere .
positive	mychewy has such better packing , everything came in perfect_condition .
positive	plus , the prices are great !
positive	roam_right - does it right !
positive	coverages - done with care
positive	customer_service - outstanding ; friendly ; experienced and factual !
positive	roam_right receives a triple aaa with me !
positive	we will definetly used them on all our future_trips !
positive	i purchased thuja occidentalis to try with my toy_poodle who has some warts .
positive	i have not had it long enough to tell whether it is going to work with her .
positive	i have given her only one dose so_far , and i have read that it works for some dogs and not for others .
positive	order response and shipping was excellent .
positive	very good sight and very quick in shipping
positive	ordered on a sunday and had my dog_food in 0 days .
positive	will_definitely order from them again .
positive	town_fair tire in wet hartford is truly amazing .
positive	my tire caps got welded on and the tire system needed to be replaced .
positive	service was quick , always tried to give me the best rate and the associate jeff was really great .
positive	i have found this company absolutely amazing .
positive	all of their staff are considerate , caring , non_- judgmental and professional .
positive	highly_recommended
positive	a * service - thanks
positive	each year we make my hubby '_s amazing barbeque sauce for holiday gifts .
positive	i enjoy the the choices that i have with my own_labels in customizing our bottles .
positive	there are so many great styles to chose from .
positive	formatting is idiot_proof !
positive	i especially like the fact that i don_'_t have to reinvent my label each time because the information is saved for me !
positive	makes it quick and easy to order .
positive	shipping is quick and efficient .
positive	i would highly_reccommend this company !
positive	thanks to sparefoot , a dreaded move was problem free .
positive	very pleased with this service .
positive	tyres were fitted whilst i was at work so caused me no_hassle what so ever .
positive	would definitely recommend .
positive	i discovered petflow on facebook .
positive	recently , i realized that i was out of pet_food far too often .

positive	you could tell that the people at summerspaw . com really care about dogs and go above and beyond amazing service !

positive	can '_t get much_better_than that .
positive	. however , when i placed my order i had just bought a large_bag of dog_food and didn_'_t need it delivered so quickly .
positive	i can '_t_believe i am complaining_about the fast service , but there was a question that asked me if i wanted the delivery delayed and i said yes .
positive	but the order was still delivered immediately .
positive	i have the food in my basement as i don_'_t want it to get moldy from all the humid weather we '_ve had recently .

positive	dog_food is expensive enough to have it go bad ,

positive	i '_ve just placed my first order - - so fingers_crossed !
positive	london and paris in mid - december !
positive	- we booked the bargain ticket for london that gave_us 0 days of sightseeing plus a free river_boat_cruise .
positive	there were also free walking_tours to key places including buckingham_palace to watch the changing of the guards .
positive	because we couldn_'_t do miles of walking , the hop on & off tours were an economical solution to our needs .
positive	the service was beyond our expectations because there was a bbt person to give us help , advice and directions wherever went .
positive	the commentary was very good with some real characters talking to us about the major points of interest plus stories , legends and tales about related people and events .
positive	doing this in december was really , really cold on top so sat downstairs most of the time .
positive	luckily , london stayed dry and we had some great sunny weather .
positive	unluckily , paris was very wet on the day we chose to take the bus so we did get very wet and cold as the best views were from upstairs .
positive	the free rain_ponchos are a nice_gesture but a rain canopy upstairs would have been preferred .
positive	also in paris , bbt had arranged for one of the other bus companies to take their customers but we weren_'_t advised of the arrangement so we spent some time trailing around in the rain trying to find the bus_stop before we found out .
positive	however , it was still a good way for us to see and hear about the important landmarks of paris and it would have been totally brilliant on a better day .

positive	they are always spot on !
positive	excellent service and delivery , unfortunately neither refills fitted the pen which was in no way your fault as you sent what i ordered .

positive	like many i discovered baublebar via the beauty community on youtube .
positive	baublebar is now my go - to for statement pieces .
positive	they have a variety from classic to colorful .
positive	i find their use of different materials very creative , but what takes the cake is the following customer_service experience .
positive	i received an_email letting_me know that the ship - date for my order was delayed because so many people had ordered the bauble i did .
positive	the email apologized for the delay and mentioned there would be a surprise included for our patience .
positive	at that point i was already impressed .
positive	the email illustrated the integrity of the company to contact customers affected by the delay .
positive	as for the extra , i imagined it might be something small , but i certainly did not expect an extra bauble and handwritten_note .
positive	i have never been so well treated by a retail company in my life .
positive	i was so surprised that a company would send out additional product , that otherwise has retail value to them , to compensate for a shipment delay .
positive	i also really appreciated the brief note ; it felt_like a very special gesture .
positive	i will return to baublebar again and again whenever i feel the need for some new sparkle .
positive	the website was very informative and the guidance provided helped_me to choose the right products .
positive	if you ' re trying for a baby you should definitely have a look !
positive	quick and easy .

positive	very pleased with the packaging , not one little limb broken and nice to see the beautiful plants just waiting to be planted .
positive	easy to use website , helpful sales operators when i called with a query and great delivery team .
positive	my only_downside is that i ordered through a cash_back website and my cashback claim has_been declined .
positive	was informed of the order being_processed and shipping details .
positive	parts arrived quickly .
positive	great service at all times .
positive	not only did i find the site easy to navigate and quick to use , the flowers , i am told , were absolutely_beautiful and delivered on time .

positive	the story doesn_'_t stop there though because they have a facility that goes one better_than price match , they invite you to make them an offer if the price of the watch is more than you wanted to pay ..... not needing to be asked twice i made them an offer and within an_hour they had got back to me with a reduced price !

positive	we have just returned from pollensa , we stayed in an apartment overlooking the sea and marina .
positive	central for everything , on a busy street at the front but the bedrooms at the back are silent , so excellent nights_sleep .
positive	plenty to see from the balcony , in fact if we went out we all could not wait to come_back in and sit there with a glass of wine watching the world go by .
positive	well_equipped apartment with every appliance , though a few basic essentials would have been an added touch , like bin bags , washing up liquid etc , this was no problem as the shops were only a few_minutes away .
positive	if i went again i would pack dishwasher tablets etc .
positive	lovely big balcony , comfy sofas , comfy beds and amazing storage_space for clothes etc .
positive	two large bathrooms one with a sunken bath which was lovely after a day on the beach .
positive	plenty of hot_water for our needs even after filling the enormous bath .
positive	teenagers could wander out at night and we felt that they were safe .
positive	bus_stop outside , boat trips from the marina , plenty of walks to neighbouring towns or just stroll across the road to the beach !
positive	the cleaner came mid week and changed the towels and cleaned through the apartment .
positive	the only_thing we didn_'_t have was the transfers through jv as the cost was £_000 for 0 of us - nearly all the taxis seat 0 so the cost was high for a five seater .
positive	when we arrived at palma airport we jumped on the local bus into palma town centre ( these run every 00_minutes ) and cost 0 euros each , we then transferred on to the pollensa bus which cost 0 euros each , making the transfer very cheap with very little effort .
positive	the bus stopped virtually outside the apartment and even_though we arrived before the allotted_time to arrive the apartment was ready for us .
positive	we would defiantly use again .
positive	my daughter and i wanted a nice overview of the city on our first day in london and we got just that with the big_bus_tour .
positive	we had a wonderful time being driven all over the city and the commentary was excellent .
positive	we also loved the complementary cruise on the thames as well .
positive	it was definitely money well - spent !
positive	from the order confirmation to the tracking update , this was a terrific transaction .
positive	i will absolutely be buying from petflow again !
positive	!
positive	i '_ve my glasses for over two years , but i love them more than the newer pair i got made up recently .
positive	because they are half frames , the bottom of the lenses had gotten chipped and the lenses were scratched .
positive	not a chic look .
positive	when i heard on money saving_expert that reglazemyglasses were offering a £_00 discount to overhaul my beloved specs i sent them off right_away .
positive	got a call - back within days offering various_options and i chose a basic lens with scratch - resist coating .
positive	there was absolutely no annoying up - selling pressure ( unlike my original provider ).
positive	they told me to expect the glasses back within 00 - 00 days and i received them well before the outside date .
positive	i '_m really pleased - i have an - almost - brand_new pair of specs with the frame that i really like , for less_than £_00 .
positive	thanks to all the staff at reglazemyglasses .
positive	amazingly great service , very quick ( and free ) delivery !
positive	well_done .
positive	would definitely recommend to my friends .
positive	fast and efficient .
positive	very helpful and explained conditions perfectly

positive	i also ended_up ordering organza wine_bottle bags for when i visit friends etc with a bottle of wine .

positive	placed an order last_week as i ' d received information about an offer ' curry00 ' ordered 0 curries , 0 rice , 0 dahl and it was only £_00 and came with 0 complimentary celia beers !
positive	order delivered promptly by courier , well_packed .
positive	thought i might treat it like a ' takeaway ' meal one evening as us coeliacs lose out on most takeaway food as the majority isn_'_t suitable .
positive	one evening we were both tired and didn_'_t feel_like cooking from scratch , so used the cardamom chicken and one rice pouch between 0 of us , though my husband ( non coeliac ) also had a jacket potato , but there was plenty in the chicken pouch and the flavours were delicious .
positive	haven_'_t eaten the other bits yet , but confident they will be just as good .
positive	haven_'_t drunk the beer as i '_ve been off drink for 0 years and can '_t decide yet whether to break my drink fast to try it .
positive	but my husband or son can drink it if not .
positive	very impressed with the packaging as ingredients so easy to read in list format - what a brilliant idea .
positive	i would say the pouch ' for 0 ' is extremely generous , but could always make it last 0 days or share with someone like i did .
positive	a great concept and i shall_certainly order again .
positive	we have ordered many_times from strings direct and always had very good service .
positive	this time was no different .
positive	the strings are for my son '_s guitars ( he has 0 of them !)
positive	and i just followed the link he emailed to me .
positive	ordered the strings and they arrived 0 days_later .
positive	an added_bonus was the little winder gadget which came with the strings .
positive	excellent strings , excellent service .
positive	i wrote with a couple of product queries before purchasing and replies were very prompt , polite , courteous , professional and very informative .
positive	if there is a fifth project , i '_ll go back again .
positive	the logo company is not only reasonably_priced , they provide great work and do it quickly .
positive	with my last project , i was quite picky .
positive	they scrapped the whole first set of designs and started over for me .
positive	then they nailed it .
positive	very happy customer here .
positive	good service / price & product
positive	sempre disponibili , e cortesi
positive	spedizioni veloci , vasta scelta è prodotti di qualità .
positive	you all have great sales but the shipping rates are a little_steep !
positive	th quality is amazing also
positive	i ordered the lights for my dogs ' collars for our night - time walks .
positive	i absolutely love them !
positive	i had looked all over at pet_store for a similar product with no luck .
positive	one of my dogs is almost blind with glaucoma , and the light works so well for him .
positive	not only can i ( and any passing cars ) see my dogs , my poor blind guy has his path especially lit just for him .
positive	now he walks with so much more confidence at night because he can actually see a little of where he is going .
positive	thanks petflow !!
positive	!
positive	my fiance and i found brilliance . com when doing web searches on diamond information .
positive	we were interested in doing serious research to get the best quality for the least cost .
positive	brilliance was looking like the best shot .
positive	he contacted their customer_service rep who went_above and beyond regarding information .
positive	she told him what he could do to get the best bang for his buck .
positive	her help was invaluable to me getting an amazing piece of jewelry and for him to be happy with the cost in the end .
positive	they always got back to us within 00_hours , although normally it was more like 0 - 0 .
positive	i would suggest brilliance ( and have ) to multiple friends .

positive	i have to submit a fax to the company i work for once a week and did not want the expense of a fax_machine for this and sending through a shop in town is inconvenient and expensive .
positive	as the fax number i send to is an 0000 number i contacted goldfish customer_support to see if it would work using the service .
positive	they responded promptly .
positive	the first week i sent the attachment as a jpeg and when converted to pdf by goldfish the image was a bit small .
positive	since then i have used a pdf attachment which is full page - perfect , cheap and convenient .
positive	i bought the 00 miler to keep_up with my husband '_s high energy on 00 - 00 mile rides .

positive	can '_t fault lenstore at all - i ripped one of my lenses this week and so placed an order that day for a new shipment - the new lenses arrived the next_day and so saved me a lot of hassle .
positive	i use lenstore to replace specsavers who i had a monthly_subscription to for years - purely out of not having any other choice , but found them obstructive at times and not at all helpful .
positive	lenstore is perfect for my needs and i '_m so glad i '_m a customer .
positive	i '_ve been using this firm for over 00 years and have always found them to be reliable .

positive	when i gave this present to my friend she couldn_'_t_believe it was her photo on the wrapping_paper !
positive	she refused to open the gift for about an_hour cos she didn_'_t want to tear the paper !
positive	it was really quite funny watching her run_around showing everyone the paper .
positive	it definitely had the desired impact .
positive	what the hell are you holding onto your old phone for !
positive	give it up already ;)
positive	there was a problem with the delivery and festive_lights had to do a lot of chasing , but they kept me informed at all times .

positive	all_aspects of this transaction , from the order process to the delivery of goods went like_clockwork .
positive	i ' d particularly like to commend the delivery team bel000 , who made a real effort to locate my house , which is slightly off the beaten track .
positive	i was delighted with the process , and with the goods , selected from the detailed_description and video on the site .
positive	i was always hesitant to use priceline because i didn_'_t understand it .
positive	once i took the time to read secondary reviews and understand the bidding_process and the new express_deals i found a way to get an extra day of vacation in for the same price i was planning to spend for less nights .
positive	i will_definitely use again .
positive	i use ancestrtal .

positive	my husband and i have been traveling around the world for 0 year and we have been booking most of our hostels on hostelbookers . com .
positive	they have the best website , the best prices for hostels , and you can trust that the places you will be staying are good based on previous travelers ' reviews .
positive	i like that you can book online at any time of the day and get an instant reservation .
positive	there is no stress or waiting to hear back from the hostel to know if your reservation went through .
positive	when you are traveling for an extended period of time , you want things to go quickly and easily so you can enjoy your time traveling , not be checking your email 00 times a day to see if the hostels got back to you on reservations .
positive	the website has descriptions of facilities and photos of the hostels as well , so you know what to expect .
positive	i also like that hostelbookers does not charge a fee , as other_websites do .
positive	sometimes plans change .
positive	you can get sick or you miss a bus , or maybe even your bus doesn_'_t show up !
positive	i don_'_t want to lose out on a lot of money if these problems arise .
positive	most travelers who are staying in hostels are on a budget and can '_t aford to pay all these extra_fees .
positive	it '_s good to know that hostelbookers understands the needs of travelers .
positive	this went smooth .
positive	i '_ll let you know more after my check in .

positive	very good service
positive	hi .
positive	they corrected the problem i ' d like my review to reflect that in all fairness .
positive	how do i do that ?
positive	paid me full price for my iphone 0 00gb when they were out of stock and couldn_'_t send me a replacement .
positive	we use this company all the time for battery '_s , they are so quick from ordering to delivery .
positive	all i can say is '' brilliant service ''.
positive	ordered on friday_afternoon and my chocolates arrived on tuesday_morning would of been the monday but it was a bank_holiday .
positive	i will_definitely be using this company again .
positive	exellent company , i buy a lot of miniature whisky '_s for my dad from here , and also unusual whisky '_s for my friends for christmas and also birthday '_s , delivery is really fast .
positive	if you want a present for someone that '_s different this is the place to buy from .
positive	i am always so pleased with the quick service and the great products !
positive	i was impressed by the quality of the knives and baking trays .
positive	i wanted decent knives that were heavy and could be kept sharp .
positive	i then ordered a lot of other items to replace worn out equipment including baking trays that food superglues itself to , chopping boards that are more cuts than board and utensils where the coating has long gone .
positive	i did buy more than i anticipated as they had a 0 for 0 on a huge_range of stuff .
positive	i now have a really useful mango cutter that i did not even know_existed !
positive	i have ordered loads of clothes from boohoo now .
positive	the website has no_glitches so is easy to use .
positive	there are many ranges of clothing that i can peruse individually .
positive	i like the geo range so i tend to look at that .
positive	however before i went to spain , i needed shorts , which i could easily search for across the ranges .
positive	my orders have been delivered quickly to my work address , as i not usually at home during the day .
positive	i have found that i have had to sent things back , as i have just chosen the things that suit me really well .
positive	sending things back is easy and free .
positive	they send you prepaid labels that you just stick on the parcel and take to any post_office .
positive	i have had lots of people at work commenting on how much they like my boohoo clothes , because they are unusual and flattering .
positive	what is amazing is that as the clothes are so good value , it means i can_afford to order regularly .
positive	prices for the meds i bought were have as much as my vet was charging me and i received the meds in the mail a lot quicker_than if i ordered them thru my vet .
positive	i was amazed_at how prompt my order arrived .
positive	i am very pleased and will reorder when the time comes
positive	great value , very help customer help
positive	i believe that it is unnecessary to write a review when i have given the company 0_stars .
positive	these reviews make me want to go to another company .
positive	i '_ve been doing a lot of client interviews at work - recording them and transcribing them myself to try to pull out any interesting quotes we can use in our marketing activities .
positive	it is such a painful process - pause , rewind , restart ... takes me hours for each 00 - 00 minute call .
positive	so i started looking online to see if there was anyway i could make that easier .
positive	rev is perfect .
positive	$ 0 / min is totally reasonable and compared to the time it was taking me , is actually more cost_effective .
positive	the service is easy to use in terms of being_able to upload audio / download files and track jobs .
positive	and their turnaround time is great - they say 00_hours but they '_ll deliver your job in batches if it makes_sense , so i was getting the transcriptions back much_faster .
positive	in the future i probably_won_'_t ask for " verbatim " again - seeing the number of " ums " and " you knows " in my sections was too painful ;) but i will be using these_guys regularly to handle this work for me !
positive	i ordered my kitchen_tap and it arrived in less_than a week .
positive	the first one was faulty , however after discussing it with a telephone helpline ( which was free - phone - great ) i got clear_directions on who to email and the information required .
positive	the email was dealt_with the next working day and a replacement was sent on next_day delivery .
positive	would highly_recommend .
positive	ordering my appliance was easy , the reviews of the products useful and website easy to use .
positive	i liked the fact that i could choose from multiple days my delivery and that you could choose further paid for options such as timed deliveries , recycling of old appliances and installation if required .
positive	the delivery team we ' re great , calling me that day to narrow_down the estimated delivery time .
positive	they we ' re very careful when bringing in the appliance and removing the old one and explained specific details relating to the item .
positive	all in all pretty_much all you need when making an important appliance purchase .
positive	everything i have ordered has_been exactly_what was pictured .

positive	i have been a customer of victoria '_s secret for about 00 years .
positive	for about 0 of those years i was a fitness instructor and that '_s when they really saved me .
positive	i was working a full time day job and teaching at night and on the weekends .
positive	i never had time to shop but was always in need of bras and workout clothes .
positive	they consistently provided functional , breathable , well made clothing that fits like a glove and somehow also manages to make me feel beautiful .
positive	their online customer_service and return_policy for web orders is super easy .
positive	i also really love their casual clothing ( especially the extra long length pants and jeans ), shoes , and dresses for going out .
positive	people always ask me where i get my clothes and when i say victoria '_s secret catalog they ' re surprised .
positive	i guess it '_s kinda my secret !
positive	my thing with coupons is : i clip them , i put them in my wallet , and there they sit until they expire .
positive	and that '_s where i find them , always after i have already paid full price for the thing i needed a coupon for in the first place .
positive	this is why i love coupon shoebox .
positive	because i can actually go and look for a coupon right when i need it .
positive	i don_'_t know how many wonderful people they have working for them but they are like santa claus with a bunch of elves over there .
positive	they scour the internet and find coupon_codes and then they just post them on their site .
positive	and that '_s it .
positive	easy .
positive	you grab the codes and use them on whatever site you ' re shopping on .
positive	christmas time 00 / 0 000 .
positive	such a blessing .
positive	i had no_issues with this company ... was able to find what i wanted quickly and shipping was reasonable !

positive	i '_m very happy i bought from medisave !
positive	i love this site and check it frequently for sales , especially on shoes !
positive	after 0 returns , i finally found the perfect dress !
positive	your staff ( melody ) was so patient and helpful in explaining the process for returns and in - store credits .
positive	she went_above the call of duty to email me pictures of the actual dress that was in the warehouse so i could see the actual color .
positive	she used natural light , flash , no flash and explained the fabric and the design of the dress to help me understand .
positive	she was timely in returning my calls .
positive	she made shopping at newyorkdress a pleasant_experience .
positive	i felt_like my friend was helping_me .
positive	good feeling .
positive	the wine_bottle with the glass on top - what a brilliant idea !
positive	i have bought it for someone as a christmas_present so hopefully stop them from getting up and down to fill there glass !!!

positive	found bedeck products to be excellent quality .
positive	prompt delivery & there customer_service to be 00 / 00 .
positive	well_done .
positive	would have no_hesitation in buying from bedeck in the future .
positive	last_year my primary care physician suggested that i try to find comfrey cream in hopes of healing a broken bone .
positive	i '_ve always been open to natural treatments as_opposed to an otc quick fix .
positive	i don_'_t know how , but i came_across pureformulas website .
positive	the first thing that attracted me was the free_shipping for any order .
positive	then i noticed that the price_ranges are suitable to even the most limited_budget .
positive	i as impressed to see that i didn_'_t have to do additional research because of the information provided for each item .
positive	a few_weeks_later i had another health issue and elected to continue on the natural path .
positive	i '_ve told every person i know to make pureformulas his / her one - stop_shop .
positive	not long ago i wanted to try a treatment for my pet dander allergy .
positive	i contacted the company on a social_media site .
positive	within 00 - 00_hours i received a reply and link directly to all of the allergy medicines best suited for pet allergies .
positive	pureformulas is as close to perfection as it gets .
positive	i brought my broken frames to lenscrafters ( where i got my glasses ) and they told me that they were unfixable ( and then quickly shifted the conversation to buying a new pair from them right_away ).
positive	opticsfast fixed them in less_than a week , for under_$_000 - which is so much less_than a new pair .
positive	thanks opticsfast !
positive	it was great great great great great
positive	the choices and the way they walked you thru it was right on .
positive	i was a first time user of getting professional labels done .
positive	i '_m a happy_camper with my new labels can '_t wait to use them .
positive	it was a simple end to end process with no_hidden_costs and you get exactly_what you pay for .
positive	all documentation send immediately in easy to download format .
positive	i love the wide_selection -- anything i need , they have .
positive	i once had a problem in which i did not receive the delivery because of something which was my fault and not theirs .
positive	they were very understanding , professional , and generous to make_sure that i got my items as i meant to order them .
positive	since i '_ve started_using coveryourhair . com , i haven_'_t used any other hair covering sites .
positive	the prices for kind bars are lower_than the ones on the kind website .

positive	goldstar allow us to see cultural events that are often out of our budget .
positive	your products are fantabulous .
positive	i also participate in the spoiled_rotten program and i must_say you are definitely spoiling the pets .
positive	as soon as they see the box they do their open the box , open the box dance .
positive	i have a suggestion for you .
positive	when the page comes up that says would you like your order repeated .
positive	why not do a check off the item for the repeat .
positive	i order some of the same stuff and would like them sent on a regular_basis .
positive	i don_'_t necessarily want my total $_00 order repeated as i like to try new things .
positive	my last order had an_error .
positive	i ordered a number of magnets ( i love my dog , dogs , rescue etc .
positive	and 00 of them were incorrect .

positive	my 00 year_old cat needs special , hypoallergenic prescription cat_food .
positive	in order to get it from my vet , i would have to take him for a visit every six_months .
positive	that was not going to happen --- my cat is deathly afraid of the vet !
positive	i was worried i was not going to be able to give my cat the food he needs , and that he was going to suffer because of it .
positive	enter petflow . com !!
positive	they took my vet '_s information , made sure i was " allowed " to purchase the prescription cat_food , and set me up on an automatic delivery schedule .
positive	easy as that !
positive	my cat never runs out of his food and i never have to worry_about vet visits .
positive	and the one time i had to deal with petflow '_s customer_service , they were as polite and helpful as they could_possibly be .
positive	all in all , i would ( and have ) recommend petflow . com to anyone .
positive	i truly believe what i said --- they saved my cat '_s life .
positive	we booked our trip to singapore , new_zealand , australia and bali through rwe back in january_0000 .
positive	vicki webster dealt_with all my initial requests for information extremely professionally and efficiently .
positive	she came up with a number of great suggestions and hotels to make our trip as memorable as possible .
positive	knowing that you have someone at the end of the phone or email with a good understanding of what you are looking for made what i initially thought would be a nightmare task into a really enjoyable_experience .
positive	she spent time looking for the best hotels with the best offers to suit my families needs .
positive	there was no hard selling just great advice and help which made the decision to use rwe a no_brainer .
positive	i have just returned from a fantastic month away where everything went exactly to plan .

positive	i find that this is the cheapest online company that i trust for hair , beauty and fragrance products .
positive	my only_niggle is that their delivery times are often a little_longer_than other company '_s that i use .
positive	i would still give them 0_stars because of the quality and price of their goods .
positive	just make_sure you don_'_t leave it til last_minute to order things you need from them .
positive	typically my last 0 orders have taken 0 - 0 days .
positive	it was a real relief that the simple measurement system worked for me .

positive	my laptop is over two years old and all of the sudden i couldn_'_t type any more .
positive	the keyboard wouldn_'_t work at all .
positive	i remembered i had bought a 0 year_warranty and got on the website and checked .
positive	i was so happy it was still under_warranty .
positive	it was a very simple process to have my laptop repaired .

positive	i was so impressed with floraqueen .
positive	being in south_africa and wanting flowers delivered to a small_village in spain , i had no_idea who to approach as i knew it would be a difficult order to deliver .
positive	i found floraqueen on the internet and place my order on - line .
positive	floraqueen very quickly responded with confirmation that it would require a special delivery and therefore they would not be able to deliver within 00_hours .
positive	they offered a full_refund or an option to deliver the flowers a day later by special courier .
positive	i went for the latter and my friend was absolutely_thrilled with her flowers .

positive	they have a great selection and some of the best prices we can find !

positive	this was an easy way to compare several storage_units in my area and locate one that fit my needs the best .
positive	i am very happy with the service and with the storage_facility it directed me to .
positive	well , i bought 0 maxi posters of bands like green day and the red hot chilli peppers and a photographic print of bellatrix lestrange and lucius malfoy from harry_potter and the deathly hallows part 0 .
positive	i chacked the site thoroughly to ensure it was legit and checked the security features as i am always hesitant about using credit_cards on new sites , but everything seemed genuine , so i used the 00_% dicsount code which i thought was fantastic as i '_m always looking for a bargain .
positive	shortly_after_placing my order i recived a confirmation e_- mail with the list of my orders and the prices etc .
positive	i placed my order on thursday ( i think ), and the first item arrived on the monday - the harry_potter print .
positive	it came in an envelope with big red letters saying do not bend , which i thought was cool as even_though it '_s not their responsibility they still took_care of my product .
positive	inside the envelope was the print in a plastic wrap to protect it and a piece of paper with another list of my order .
positive	but this was the only product to arrive - so i started to panic .
positive	since it had the list of my order i thought that everything would be arriving at once and as it hadn_'_t i thought they had been lost in the post or the order had been misplaced .
positive	so i slept on it and the next_day the other 0 arrived .
positive	they were rolled up together in one tube and were suprisingly heavy - exceptionally good quality .
positive	i hung them all up and they ' re perfect , my typical teenager '_s bedroom is complete .
positive	my only dissapointment with the site is the delivery charges .
positive	i want to get 0 more harry_potter photgraphic prints which are quite expensive at £ 0 . 00 each for their size , and finding out i have to pay delivery for each one seems a bit of a joke .
positive	why can '_t they be put in one envelope ?
positive	they ' re small enough .
positive	this aside i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use gbposters . com again .
positive	one mroe thing .
positive	on the paper i recieved with the photographic print there was a code for another 00_%_discount , which can be used with any offers on the site - fantastic !
positive	a bit hard to find with the gps , but very convenient , especially the drop_off of the car after you arrived , so no shuttle back to parking_lot needed !
positive	!
positive	easy to order , with fast efficient service , my order was delivered the next_day .
positive	terrific experience with ease in ordering , excellent customer_service on phone and really strong packaging for safe shipping to protect bottles .
positive	also received shipment days earlier_than promised .
positive	the type of royal_canin dog_food that my dogs like is hard to find .

positive	excellent company !

positive	we needed an etched pen as a leaving present and didn_'_t have a lot of time .
positive	the pen was dispatched the same day and arrived with plenty of time to spare .
positive	i live in de and ordered my flowers from kalas because it
positive	seemed to be the best florist i could locate on the internet
positive	from annapolis .
positive	i ordered a white spray of roses and other

positive	i like ordering food from internet .
positive	when i need stuff i look to see who has specials and free_shipping i '_m not loyal to 0 place .

positive	the ordering process was so simple and easy to navigate .
positive	the items that i ordered were delivered the following_day !

positive	if you had to return any item the return system is straight_forward too .
positive	it wasn_'_t busy at all when i came in and i was offered help straight_away .
positive	the sales_associate was helpful and went to check if she had any back stock of what i was looking for .
positive	she then arranged for it to be ordered ( as hey didnt have it in store ) and sent to my home address .
positive	the delivery took a while , accompanied with some confusing emails ( seemingly automated ), but we got our nappies yesterday and can '_t wait to start using them on my lil ' one .
positive	great jewellery , excellent customer_service , very fast shipping !
positive	!
positive	i am very happy with petflow .
positive	my only_complaint is that most of the coupons can only be used if you are a new customer .
positive	it seems like you would want to reward the people who continue to buy from your company .
positive	i searched several websites for costumes and prices .
positive	this was the best price for the same costume .
positive	we are very happy with the costume and it looks great on her .
positive	quick and accurate delivery
