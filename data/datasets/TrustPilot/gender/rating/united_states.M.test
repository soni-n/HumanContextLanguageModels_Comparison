negative	overall i will never order from part geek ever again due to the poor customer service and parts selection .
negative	i was very disappointed in the web_site and the whole_experience with parts_geek .
negative	worse car parts experience yet .
negative	the strut i ordered for my car was defective right outta the box and partsgeek has taken way too much time refunding my money for it !
negative	it has_been almost two_weeks since they received it and they haven_'_t updated me in the status of my refund !
negative	what the hell partsgeek !
negative	don_'_t shop_here .
negative	head over to rockauto . com instead .
negative	similar or sometimes better prices and extremely prompt customer service .
negative	don_'_t make the same mistake i did .
negative	stay_away from partsgeek !
negative	terrible .
negative	i will never buy from them again .
negative	i always buy from rockauto . com and i love it affordable and reliable never have i gotten the wrong part from them and the customer service is top_notch
negative	there is no option for me to choose which type of room i want to stay , during the online reservation process .
negative	this defect cost me $_00 more to get a double_bed room at the counter .
negative	made a reservation on the website just like it was explained and called within the 00hrs to pay in full , but was told that it was " too_late ".
negative	really ???
negative	within the 00hr period ?
negative	?
negative	they offered me the same flight with the same airline ( aa ) but $_000 more , i decided to use the website of the airline i was flying with and ended_up having to pay just $_000 . 00 more .
negative	cheapoair is a joke !
negative	can '_t rely_on these_people .
negative	asking for a review when i '_m still_waiting for a part ordered 00 days ago !
negative	a duplicate order was placed that caused me to request a cancellation of the order no more than 0 / 0 hour after i ' d placed the order .
negative	i called the customer service number to speak to a representative and each time i was placed on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	twice i was told by a recording that my call was important and a representative would be with me shortly and each time i was hung_up on .
negative	i then emailed the company and was informed that i could return the merchandise and pay $_00 restocking_fee which i feel is unfair for my situation .
negative	every customer is not in the business of buying and sending merchandise back but when i honestly make a mistake as a return customer and get the treatment i received it made me never want to purchase from partsgeek again .
negative	i '_ve purchased parts for my sons car and given him the ok to buy from partsgeek which i no_longer will support .
negative	it '_s a shame that you have such a good arena for buying hard to get parts and spoil it by poor customer service .
negative	now i have two_sets of fans and the wrong cabin_air_filter that i would have to pay stocking fees to return .
negative	i '_m sorry but i can no_longer do busines with your organization .
negative	don_'_t use pickfords to move in south_africa .
negative	briefly .
negative	0 .
negative	we asked them to move our possessions from johannesburg from cape_town to johannesburg and then store them .
negative	instead they stored our possessions in johannesburg so they were not available for delivery when we had a move in date .
negative	when i challenged this head of the service who hates working with people said it was their practise .
negative	i replied that they couldn_'_t amend the agreement on a whim .
negative	she insisted that they could .
negative	0 .
negative	we asked for an invoice because my new employer would pay .
negative	however the invoice was so incorrect : e . g .
negative	reflecting a move from cape_town to johannesburg instead of the other way around that my employer refused to pay .
negative	then pickfords sent a demand instead of correcting the invoice .
negative	it took them two months to correct the invoice .
negative	0 .
negative	we paid for insurance but they never paid out .
negative	the demanded photographs of missing items .
negative	so you cannot claim anything unless you photographed it before you entrusted it to them .
negative	they demanded photos of damaged items but then set their email rules up so that they cannot recieve photographs because the files are too large .
negative	i provided most of the proof but they never paid .
negative	i opened a paypal_account but after i experienced problems phoned paypal ( i don_'_t know what to call the part of paypal that i phoned because titles like " support " or " customer care " are the opposite of what they do .
negative	the employee i spoke simply closed my paypal_account despite my specifcally instructing him not to do so .
negative	apparently employees are encouraged to act from spite because when i called and spoke a supervisor and supervisors supervisor none of them could or rather would help me .
negative	although i was told that i could try to open an account at a later date i cannot trust a company in which employees can act on a whim without the slightest oversight .
negative	awful , awful company to do_business with .
negative	one of the items i ordered was out of stock , but at no point was i informed of this until after the other item i ordered was delivered and i asked them where my missing item was .
negative	customer service was non_existent .
negative	responses to my queries were one line sentences with no name provided letting_me know who was actually responding .
negative	the target delivery date they provided for the item was not met .
negative	only after having to go back and ask again did they tell me they wouldn_'_t be able to ship it for about 0 months .
negative	" there has_been a further delay on your order and this item has_been delayed until early december_0000 ."
negative	not very helpful .
negative	or apologetic .
negative	very much a ' deal with it ', type of sentiment to that message .
negative	i phoned to tell them i wasn_'_t happy with their customer service and they provide no more help over the phone either .
negative	quite_frankly you can tell they just don_'_t care .
negative	i will never purchase anything through gak again and would recommend you search elsewhere before trying to buy something off their site , its not worth the hassle if you can even get the item at all .
negative	i got a part that was broken , to return it i have to pay return shipping along with since i threw away the box i cannot return it now .
negative	i placed an order for a part i needed shipped to the garage where my car was being worked on .
negative	my car broke_down while i was a couple hours away from home on business .
negative	the order was cancelled because the shipping and billing_address did not match .
negative	their policy says that you can not ship to a different address for your first order .
negative	the only way you may do so is by setting an_alternate address with your credit_card company .
negative	i wrote them an_email explaining the situation , also saying that i wouldn_'_t be setting the garage as an_alternate address for my car , because it '_s not my place , and i '_ll likely never be there again .
negative	i asked them to please reconsider , and invited them to call me so that we can work it out .
negative	the representative who contacted me a few_days_later wasn_'_t all together rude or difficult .
negative	the email was cordial , if only at the beginning .
negative	in the end he was ... curt .
negative	he put it simply : if you don_'_t want to add the address , we can '_t help you .
negative	great .
negative	thanks .
negative	never sent a tracking_number , no customer service to speak of .
negative	no way to call you because you make it impossible to contact you .
negative	when i emailed you telling you i never got my parts you emailed me a return form for the parts i never got 0 days_later !!!!!!
negative	you could have just sent a tracking_number !!!!
negative	i will never order from you again !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a bathroom set for express delivery and paid a premiuim price to have just the taps delivered .
negative	when i tried to dispute why the bath at when the plumber is coming the next_day , so i arranged for the delivery of the bath my self from their distributor for next_day delivery
negative	the bath came without the bath panel filthy dirty .
negative	told bath panel would be 00 days , but no exact date
negative	spoke with [_name ] about the terrible service offered twenty_five pounds
negative	emailed him saying unacceptable 0 days ago and still no reply from big bathroom to my complaint or the complaints sent to their office
negative	they pretend to be cheap but your paying full retail as they use mark 0 distributors in bolton who are a trade outlet
negative	dont use them , they are useless and have no customer service or understanding the of the stress waiting for a bathroom to come
negative	they have tried to have my review deleted
negative	taking over 0_weeks to port over 0 business line .
negative	they are not proactive ... i have had to call on try to resolve the issues .
negative	i tried to conference in phone_power and the other provider , but phone_power use level 0 and will not contact them wiyh the customer on the line .
negative	spedizione in ritardo di molti giorni .... il_sito dava per disponibile l ' oggetto ma alla fine non_era disponibile ..... ho aspettato 00 giorni dicendomi che 0 giorni e arriva .... poi ho annullato l ' ordine ..... sito da evitare .....
negative	i ordered a part for my truck .
negative	there web_site said it was the right part .
negative	it was not .
negative	i have to pay to ship it back .
negative	i was not happy about it and will never buy from them again .
negative	getting ahold of them is a nightmare too .
negative	i have purchased from ny protein a few_times , 0 time box was damaged and goods i sent pictures they wanted more lol i sent 0 , my last purchasei open the protein bsf with scissors so it '_s a clean cut to find the bag reseal is not there poor quality product i was very gutted when i have purchased a lot from myprotein but my last order put me over the edge now
negative	i e_-_mail you guys about a part for 0000 awd infinity front driver_side hub assmly .
negative	you found the part and you reassured me that : that was the part and i sent an e_-_mail back to you guys to double_check and got no response so seen the part was already order and from your cockiness on how sure you guys were i had no other choice but to wait for the part .
negative	well guest what this is not the part .
negative	so what to do now .
negative	it '_s my day off on a sunday with my car completely torn apart i have to put the whole car back together with the bad part becauce of your incompetence .
negative	thanks
negative	sicne this was your fault i think i should be getting a complete refund .
negative	i hope your competent enough to do that .
negative	ans to top it off i had to pay for shipping on a part that was wrong that they sent .
negative	i will never do_business with these incompetent people .
negative	i would not recommend to anybody , i received the wrong parts , called them back , couldn_'_t speak with anybody due to high_volume of calls .
negative	i have to return the wrong parts for a refund but have to pay for my own shipping .
negative	they are only after your money , once they make a mistake they don_'_t take any responsibility for the mistake .
negative	i '_m very disappointed .
negative	i ordered my part .
negative	i got a shady response about an issue with my address .
negative	they put a hold on my account for a week and returned the money with 0 less dollars .
negative	do that to 000 people a day and you have yourself a successful scam site !
negative	thanks for nothing .
negative	i called and called and got no one on the phone with the same generic music everytime that would disconnect me .
negative	would rather set my money on fire than give a penny to parts scam !
negative	parts ordered were good quality but not right for the described application .
negative	once this part was determined to be listed incorrectly the return process sucks !!!
negative	i ordered a part that should have been something but was not so being doubtful in my decision i ordered the same part from the local dealership and received a completely different part but the parts were both ordered as the same thing .
negative	your sales_person_who answered the phone totally misrepresented himself i called the number under la_quinta he answered la_quinta suites . he never said that he was from a different company representing la_quinta .
negative	he quoted me a price and told me that there was no discount for aaa or aa rp . he then proceeded to take my charge card number to reserve the room when i arrived at the la_quinta suites i was going to pay cash and i found out but this was and another company expedia . com we already charged my account la_quinta itself was very nice acted quickly and correct the situation that you cost
negative	where to begin ...
negative	0 ) lack of communication .
negative	they dont answer emails or return phonecalls .
negative	0 ) they short shipped my order .
negative	still_waiting for my dextrose which i ordered in december .
negative	they are not replying my emails or phonecalls .
negative	i guess i lost the money .

negative	i did a google_search for a ac deco radiator for a 0000_buick la saber and stock wise_auto came up i went to there site and looked up the ac_delco and it was listed as in stock so i purchased .
negative	but today i received form stock wise a vista pro radiator .
negative	i did not want to pay the dealer price and stock wise had a good price so i bought on line .
negative	american '_s are not dumb i wanted original_equipment in my old car for a reason every thing ells leaks .
negative	not satisfied and not happy i mean ac_delco and vista pro are two different manufactures why the scam .
negative	i ordered a left rear lens off the website and received the right one .
negative	i thought i had ordered the wrong side .
negative	i sent the lens back and ordered the left lens and received the right one again .
negative	i am sending this one back also and would like my shipping_charges refunded as i never received the correct part .
negative	i ordered a strut and strut_mount for 0000_mercedes e000 wrong parts , wrong info on web , no refund or even rma for both parts for return .
negative	almost 00 days and tickets are blocked as well as email .
negative	no phone contact as the customer service number is bogus .
negative	facts :
negative	on saturday august 0rd 0000 the following parts were ordered as part of a larger order :
negative	0000_mercedes e000 strut_mount suspension price : $_00 . 00 core : $ 0 . 00 qty_: 0 part_#: w0000_- 0000000
negative	0000_mercedes e000 shock_absorber suspension price : $_000 . 00 core : $ 0 . 00 qty_: 0 part_#: w0000_- 0000000
negative	after numerous_attempts to reach the returns_department and multiple support tickets , i finally recieved this response via_email on august_00th .
negative	" hello , can you please tell me what the part you received brand is .
negative	also what is the exact manufacturer part number on the box or the part itself ( not our parts catalog number ) to determine what was actually sent versus what you should have received .
negative	also please understand you may have ordered the wrong part i will need your vin to confirm what type of car you have and the specs on it to see if the part is right or wrong for your car .
negative	provided vin , again as i did with original order and part numbers off parts :
negative	wdbuf00j00a000000 vin_number
negative	00000000000 part number blistien shock - obviously their error
negative	000000000 part number strut_mount - obviously their error
negative	confirmation order email also confirms i ordered correct part for my 0000_mercedes_benz
negative	after this , over 00 emails followed for rma requests for parts return with no luck .
negative	finally , i had to contact nj attorney generals office to start file and make multiple complaints and reports to finally obtain rma for both parts on sept 00th .
negative	now they indicated i did not need part anymore to trust_pilot which i can show the almost 00 tickets and numerous_emails trying to obtain assistance .
negative	up until now i have yet to speak to a real_person from purchase to present !
negative	they are going to take 00 days to refund my money and also threatened to charge me a restock_fee for their mistake .
negative	let '_s add up how much money they have costed me :
negative	shipping , over 00 . 00 .
negative	shipping new parts 00 . 00
negative	replacement vehicle 000 . 00
negative	time spent on this ............$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
negative	i will follow_up with positive or negative_feedback with respect to partsgeek . com when the refund process is over .
negative	i '_m sure my experience will be consistant with the fact patterns of other consumers facing the same issues .

negative	i '_ve been eating kfc for as long as i can remember .
negative	i always enjoyed their food over other fast food companies .
negative	i loved their chicken pot pies .
negative	they didn_'_t get my order right one day when i went through the drive thru .
negative	the order was way off , and i did not want to eat what i had been given and i didn_'_t have time to go back .
negative	i tried to call the local number on the receipt and was greeted with a this number is disconnected message .
negative	so i visited their website and sent an_email to the address they had listed describing what happened and asking for some coupons for compensation .
negative	i got no response .
negative	i sent them a second email which wasn_'_t so nice , and got no response again .
negative	i '_ve been boycotting kfc ever since and don_'_t plan on returning with my company credit_card .
negative	i attempted to purchase tickets from thetrainline . com , but their system told me the " transaction could not be completed due to a bank card security issue ".
negative	as a result , i purchased my tickets directly from station .
negative	a few_days_later i discovered that the charge for the online tickets showed_up on my credit_card after all .
negative	i have been fighting with them for a refund , but they lack human understanding and will not own up to the fact that their own system gave_me faulty information .
negative	be very cautious !
negative	i suggest you avoid this company before they scam you as well !
negative	i orsred a set for 0000 .
negative	was called after and tild to get all accessories the set is manufactured with i would really need to pay 0000 because the 00 inch tv needed the 0 year_warranty mandatory .
negative	i got the tv .
negative	i never got my warranty .
negative	i paid 000 . 00 and never got a thing .
negative	i already filed a complaint with the bbb of nj .
negative	my agent was zachary .
negative	i ordered a simple outside driver door_handle for my camary .
negative	the part took almost two_weeks to get here and when it did it was the wrong part .
negative	i received rear passenger handle no precut hole for the lock .
negative	so i guess i wait another few weeks for my part or what .
negative	speaking completely about about the 0rd_party reservation intake company
negative	i asked_him if he was the renainanse hotel and he said he makes reservations for all .
negative	if i had known that it was it expedia i would not have made the reservation because you charge the credit_card after the reservation is made .
negative	i cancell the reservation and i `_m awaiting my refund
negative	ordered parts 00 days ago 0 or 0 day shipping what a joke
negative	i orderd more than 0_weeks_ago and haven_'_t recieved anything yet
negative	the booking times were mixed up and when i phoned to correct it , the return time was still not corrected .
negative	the car was left spotlessly clean but was returned spattered and dirty .
negative	did not even send a power_cable out so i had to wait days to get my new pc up and running who forgets something so simple !
negative	then rang customer_services the man was very rude hung_up rang again but choose sales instead and it was the same person !!!!
negative	!
negative	i bought an $_000 . 00 gas range but did not buy the extended service contract .
negative	after 00 months the $_000 . 00 computer failed so that nothing except the top burners would work .
negative	i complained to the store where i purchased the stove and they would not even try to get the repair cost reduced after only 0 months beyond the warranty .
negative	i gave the stove away and went to my local maytag dealer and purchased a nearly identical stove for about the same price .
negative	i did buy their extended_warranty and got 0 years of protection for less_than what sears wanted for one year and which included parts and labor !
negative	the stove is now over 0 years old and has had zero_problems .
negative	i told the store where i purchased the sears stove that based on their total_lack of customer_support and poor product life span , that i would never again purchase any product sold by sears .
negative	i did relent and bought 0 tools from a sears store that was going out of business .
negative	probably due to the same sort of service that the original store provided .
negative	reserved a storage_unit , when i showed_up at the facility ready to unpack , i was told by the desk_clerk that there were no units , and that the computer system was having issues , so they never received my reservation .
negative	no storage , no help , just a waste of my time .
negative	i ordered a part that was ordered in a pair .
negative	one part was right and one was wrong .
negative	it took way to long for a response rma .
negative	and even now i '_m waiting to see if i am getting the right part or a refund before i go out and buy the right part .
negative	nobody answered the sales line in a week .
negative	with no interaction with a human this company will fail .
negative	i am part of the porsche club of america .
negative	i have already started telling people never to buy from this company .
negative	i just can '_t believe what a terrible and frustrating exeperince .
negative	my car is a part waiting for any part .

negative	el colchón se ha deformado y no vuelve a su estado natural produciendo dolor de espalda .
negative	una muy mala compra , sin_duda no volveré a comprar .
negative	very good customer service , fast and satisfying .
negative	i have a solution , i do not know if it will fix the problem .
negative	the purchased product of very poor quality , deforms and returns to its causing back pain .
negative	product was late being despatch ed !
negative	also compleatly wrong item to what i thought i had orderd !
negative	it might aswel of been back - to - front , upside - down and inside - out .....!
negative	!
negative	doesn_'_t fit at all !
negative	i measured down to the last " mm "
negative	over all - product information far from accurate !
negative	i order quite a few auto_parts from your company and tried to call u a few_times to get questions_answered befor i order the parts and to find i got 0x to 0x more of the same item then i needed i tried to called a few_times and could not get through to you the operator tells you to hold on and then it we can be reached by email at this time i need to return some of the items because some was order two or three_times and i ordered just what i need now lets start the return process
negative	this site is used by people who want independent info on a company , however the company reviewed can get trustpilot to alter the review if it doesn_'_t like what is said .
negative	i gave a review which also mentioned my experience with other_companies for comparison , this was edited which i find outrageous .
negative	if you read or write a review one would expect comparisons as that is what we review against - our own experiences .
negative	by not mentioning the alternative names we could just be plucking opinions out of thin air !
negative	i imagine this happens to a lot of reviews and therefore i do not trust this site at all and would encourage_others to exercise extreme caution .
negative	ordered a coffee_table , it arrived damaged and with a set of components which made it impossible to assemble and no assembly_instructions .
negative	ordered 0_weeks_ago and despite_repeated_attempts to get a replacement part or parts , nothing has shown up yet .
negative	do not believe all the 0 * rating reviews , they are almost certainly bogus .
negative	stay well away from them if you want hassle_free delivery and after sales service .
negative	i ordered 0 tins of dulux paint online and i didn_'_t arrive within their 0 days delivery promise .
negative	phoned customer_services ( took half_hour to get through ) to obtain a refund because i was sick of waiting in for it to arrive and was told it wouldn_'_t be despatched til 0 days time when the warehouse received another delivery .
negative	was told i couldn_'_t get a refund until the monday ( the day it was going to be despatched ) because of a change in product code .
negative	was offered by the customer service advisor ( jan ) to see if my local store had it which was helpful .
negative	it gets worse though .
negative	she phoned back and had reserved the stock to which i said if just check my partner was happy to go and collect it now and she replied " well you better hurry up because i finish in two minutes ."
negative	i was even lied to by an advisor called deborah as well stating my order had already been despatched and was with the couriers .
negative	all in all a very bad_experience with homebase customer_services and quite_frankly the most appalling customer service advisors i '_ve ever_encountered .
negative	won_'_t be shopping with homebase again .
negative	expected delivery on 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	one piece was missing .
negative	xdp advised the supplier that it will be delivered on 00 . 00 . 00 due to an error .
negative	phoned xdp today as no new tracking_number was supplied and the old one did not show any updates to find out that no delivery is actually scheduled .
negative	phoned the supplier again and turned_out that xdp misled them as they don_'_t know where it is .
negative	two_days already wasted on waiting . will be asking for compensation now .
negative	original tracking id : zdbehk000000
negative	the parts_geek web_site showed the part fit my vehicle .
negative	once i got it and was ready to install it we found out it did not fit at all .
negative	really disappointing experience !!
negative	the web_site needs to be correct or we are all wasting our time and money on returns .
negative	jeg forstår ikke svensk .

negative	ordered 00days ago and it hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	purchased a tablet pc from them for $_00 . 00 payed via_paypal .
negative	item finally arrived 0_weeks_later it was not as_described ( no rear camera ) smashed due to poor packaging and had a non uk power_supply .
negative	tried to raise an_rma request via website but kept telling_me my order number was invalid .
negative	contacted them via the messaging facility .
negative	after sending them photo evidence , and about 00 messages they refused to give a refund unless i shipped the item back to them tracked at my expense this was more than 00_% of the cost of the item .
negative	contacted paypal who also insisted that i return the item at my cost before a refund could be issued .
negative	they also pay people to post positive_reviews
negative	i purchase a radiator at a very reaonable price .
negative	i order the porduct and it was ship to me within 0 business days .
negative	i put water into the radiator and notice a leak in the bottom righthand corner of the tank .
negative	currently , i am trying to see how this company will proceed with defective product .
negative	the price was reasonable , but the radiator has a leak .
negative	i ordered a jacket from this store for $_000 , and they emailed me 0 days_later telling_me they canceled the order because they don_'_t have stock .
negative	i never told them to cancel , and never gave them permission to cancel .
negative	upon checking their website immediately following their email , i found that they raised the price from $_000 to $_000 on the jacket .
negative	clearly , they pretended to not have the item because they didn_'_t want to sell it for $_000 , after i ' d paid for it .
negative	will be contacting amex about this .
negative	after 0_weeks and i didn_'_t get what i ordered i went back to the site and i see my order was cancelled , no_explanation , no one to call , i bought it at autozone
negative	i am very disappointed in parts_geek i order a clutch_kit and sleeve kit for a subaru car the sleeve kit is wrong and will not work .
negative	i have had poor response from parts_geek and see that i will be charged a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	i tried to open a support_ticket and have been denied by parts_geek .
negative	they sent me a email about helping_me with my parts no calls or emails from them to follow_up and help me .
negative	i had to order the proper kit from rock_auto they were great and had the right part in stock .
negative	i used to use partgeek for all my needs no_longer ill just use rockauto . com from now on .
negative	was sent a wrong part that didnt fit , visibly bad quality .
negative	i was required to return it at my expense and charged 00_% restcking fee on top of that .
negative	overall lost 00_% of price paid for bad part and about 0 . 0_weeks time .
negative	we called to make a air / car / hotel reservation and it was almost_impossible to do as the agent spoke very poor_english .
negative	then we tried to make a change , caused_by the fact that our hotel was 0 hours away from the wedding we supposed to attend .
negative	finally got that worked out for a charge .
negative	then , we needed to add another driver to our rental_car , and as of three_days trying using the phone and internet address - feedback , nothing has_been done by this useless travel_agent .
negative	actually , if i could rate them lower_than one , i would .
negative	how do people like this stay in business ?
negative	i had used floraqueen at_least 0 times in the past to have flowers delivered to the same address in spain .
negative	my past experience with floraqueen had been good .
negative	this time , however , no flowers were delivered yet the order was marked as ' delivered ' on floraqueen '_s website .
negative	i contacted floraqueen '_s customer service and received a non_- personalized message referring me to floraqueen '_s terms and conditions of sale .
negative	i contacted their customer service with two more emails , explaining that no contact had been made with either the recipient nor with me , in spite of supplying all relevant phone numbers and email_addresses .
negative	i received two responses almost_identical to the first one .
negative	the recipient was a relative so i have no reason to doubt their word .
negative	i wrote to floraqueen '_s customer service that i would contact the better business_bureau and will_certainly proceed to do so .
negative	based on this unacceptable business experience i would not recommend floraqueen to anyone .
negative	i ordered my media remote last wednesday next_day delivery and still no sign of it .
negative	now have to wait 00 days so can order another one .
negative	very dissapointing .
negative	did not recieved order yet ??????????
negative	?
negative	i placed an order which came back to me one week_later stating it is out of stock !
negative	vision_express have been absolutely awful .
negative	i have truly never received worse service in my life .
negative	i have been waiting three_weeks for a pair of single_vision glasses that i was promised would be ready in one week , then in two , then in three and still no sign .
negative	after phoning both the store i ordered from and the national customer_services number , i have received all_sorts of contradicting stories that other reviews have said are vision_express stock lines used to fob off customers .
negative	i never expected to be treated like this by a high_street brand .
negative	shocked !
negative	needless to say , i will never shop with them again .
negative	wasn_'_t deemed eligible because of the same billing_address , protein received was really tasty however wouldnt recommend to a friend due to customer service , dont_know if i would use tpw again .
negative	in my opinion i was treated unfairly as a new customer , supplying me with the free_sample would have lead to more business from myself .
negative	the first card took a few_days , but it was eventually sent .
negative	the second time , they sent me a confirmation but never delivered the giftcard .
negative	multiple questions and complaints have gone totally unanswered .
negative	ripoff .
negative	beware !
negative	they sent me used parts with no hardware !
negative	there is no contact phone_number for these issues and their email customer service is terrible .
negative	they actually expect me to pay return shipping on the used parts they sent .
negative	they will not respond to my emails asking if they are going to send a replacement part .
negative	never order from a company that you cannot call and talk to someone on the phone .
negative	the phone_number they do have is to order parts and you ’ ll be on hold for a long time then disconnected .
negative	stay_away !!
negative	!
negative	i have not used the batteries yet , but the postage was prohibitive .
negative	there must be a cheaper way of buying batteries .
negative	when , i saw the rate for my flight ticket , it was rs 0000 /-
negative	then , when i booked my ticket it showed that the flight tickets was not available .
negative	when tried it the 0nd time , it showed that the tickets were available . and when i booked it and proceeded for payment , i get a message that rs 00 , 000 /- have been charged
negative	i ended_up paying abou rs 0000 /- extra
negative	very misleading !
negative	very dissapointed with the end_result , very poorly put_together , color samples do match end_result , would not recomend and will not use tailor0less again .
negative	they are expensive , rude and inefficient .
negative	do not touch this company
negative	ordered a right side , side_view_mirror .
negative	had the correct year , make , and model of car but the part was the wrong_size .
negative	did not return it because i did not want to mess with the
negative	shipping .
negative	i was going to use this site for more business , but now i am thinking not .
negative	..............................................
negative	my part was shipped through west texas express and to this day and 0_weeks_later i have not received my part .
negative	i will not be using your service again !!
negative	!
negative	nothing but hassels to get started
negative	i used to order from another company and i always received within one or two_days .
negative	i have yet to receive the product .
negative	when i ordered by_accident from parts_geek i had meant to order from autoanything .
negative	parts_geek says they are the cheapest and i didn_'_t see that the 00_% restocking_fee would be applied even if they lied about being the cheapest .
negative	same 00 - 000 k_& n cai , part from autoanything who i had actually planned on ordering from was cheaper with free shipping no insurance fees necessary and a free cleaning_kit for over $_00 . 00 less .
negative	so i am returning it on principle , it is not cheaper and i will be stuck with the restocking_fee , but they will get the bad publicity .
negative	i will tell at_least 00 people plus the internet .
negative	if there isn_'_t any problem taking the wrong part back and getting the right part to me , i might have a better opinion ..
negative	the throttle cable that i purchased for my jaguar bound up more than the original cable .
negative	i usually deal with coventry west and have ordered a replacement .
negative	i am not a person that returns goods purchased , but always will be aware of the quality of the product from that source .
negative	you receive a failing grade .

negative	i ordered parts for a 00 jeep_grand_cherokee with 0 . 0 got a spark_plug wire set for 0 cylinder along with distributor_cap and oil_pan gasket .
negative	i need the parts to get my jeep fixed properly and would appreciate replacement parts rather_than a refund thanks for any assistance in this matter my phone_number is 000 - 000 - 0000
negative	i thought that i was getting a good deal and actually ordering in advance so i would have my part in time for my tiling project .
negative	it has now been 0_weeks since i placed my order and received confirmation ( website says " ships within 0 - 0 days ).
negative	when i placed my order , the part said that it was in stock .
negative	i called today and was told that they just received the part 0 days ago and that it will be shipping in 0 - 00 days .
negative	expected delivery 0 - 00 .
negative	i placed the order on 0 - 00 .
negative	operator called the warehouse and still no way to expedite .
negative	i asked to talk to her_supervisor , but he was in a " meeting ".
negative	she took down my number for them to call me ... never did .
negative	absolutely ridiculous .
negative	i will not be using them again ... by_far the worst online experience i have had .
negative	they don_'_t deserve a star_rating .
negative	just want to mention that i am not one to generally complain or write anything negative .
negative	this is my first review and i wish i would '_ve read some before i placed my order .
negative	i had my account limited for some reason , so could not make any purchases , trying to resolve problem would have more chance of getting blood from a stone .
negative	would not mind if i was spending their money .
negative	i would not advise anyone to purchase from this company won_'_t respond to find out who the shipper was .
negative	no response and 0 days after due date .
negative	un called for .
negative	they sent me the wrong part and it is impossible to get in touch with the wouldnt ever buy anything from here again
negative	travelocity did not archive my reservation so i made another .
negative	then tired to rectify this with travelocity .
negative	no one on their " customer service ' line speaks passable english .
negative	this whole event cost me $_000 additional and i will not deal with this company again .
negative	employ people who speak_english and understand how to help in a difficult situation such as this .
negative	also , get your computer straight .

negative	i am very angry !!!
negative	i signed_up for the 00 day free_trial and agreed to terms and conditions of the monthly maint fee in spite of the beginning pages advertising less_than $ 0 . 00 /_mo .
negative	now upon completing enrollment , i fully expected to get my 0 credit_reports without additional_charges and you are charging me $_00 . 00 !!!
negative	bull_shit !
negative	close my account and take your smoke and mirrors somewhere_else !
negative	!
negative	i did not know i was using a third_party booking tool , rather_than dealing_with country_inn and suites directly .
negative	it was not obvious .
negative	my reservation_counter person assured me that there would be a cot in the room .
negative	there was not .
negative	there was also a $_00 charge added for the cot .
negative	this is not a pleasant_surprise when traveling .
negative	the host at the hotel was less_than helpful and blamed it on the fact that i did not deal with the hotel_directly .
negative	frankly , the guy was a jerk .
negative	so , my wife hated the hotel , said we paid too much for an average room and then had to deal with a jerk who charged us for a cot adding to the already overpriced room .
negative	the email i received offered six_months of the services of identity_guard free and talked about credit bureau reports .
negative	when i tried to obtain one i found i have to pay for the reports .
negative	not a good offer .
negative	you can cancel my subscription immediately if that '_s the way this program works .
negative	ordered submitted in oct 0000 , not yet received , no answers to inquiries sent on their website .
negative	nobody_answers their phone , given message to leave a message then told that the mailbox is full so you cannot leave a message .
negative	i have now gone_through the credit_card company to receive a refund .
negative	i bought a plan for my tablet .
negative	it fell and the screen_cracked .
negative	i sent it in to square_trade right before_thanksgiving and it took 0_weeks for me to get it back .
negative	during this time i called numerous_times and was always given a different story about what is happening with the tablet .
negative	i was promised to be reimbursed the cost of the warranty 0 times but that never happened .
negative	when i did get the tablet back the screen was not oem and there was a gap_between the case and screen .
negative	it had dead spots and the system would not work .
negative	so i had to send it back this time but had to go through a manager for resolution .
negative	finally i was reimbursed but it took a month and half and alot of aggravation and broken promises
negative	i had never used an agency including travelocity and the outcome was very disgusting .
negative	i could not understand the person with whom i was speaking and they appeared clueless in how to do their job .
negative	the person should as a minimum be fluent in the use of the english_language .
negative	the hotel reservation with hampton_inn in galax , va . was totally screwed_up .
negative	ironically , the customer just prior to my arrival had an exact_same experience with travelocity .
negative	only yesterday i received my monthly illing from visa and was double charged for the visit of april 00 , 0000 .
negative	following this narraive i fully expect an_apology and a refund for the overcharge .
negative	the real clincher for me is this - one week after this tragedy i called the hotel diectly and got reseervation and the rate as $_00 , 00 less_than through travelocity - what a joke !
negative	i never intend to use travelocity and would never recommend it to anyone .
negative	please_advise via phone or e_-_mail of your intentions to refund the double charge .
negative	otherwise , i plan to take whatever action i can to recover the obvious dihonest act .
negative	i committed to storage with public_storage for 0 years and within 0 months they spiked the rates $_00 / month and wouldnt budge off the price saying they know they will lose customers over it but don_'_t care .
negative	this is one of the worst online shopping_experiences .
negative	i have had in recent days
negative	goods ordered have not arrived and i have received no follow_up email regarding delivery or lack of it and or an_apology or explanation why .
negative	all in all i will not be using this company again ever
negative	after the 0rd revision i got i had to review every_single word to make_sure that the translation was accurated .
negative	very simple mistakes that make me feel that you are just using a google translator to perform your work .
negative	that was crazy , i paid w_/ my company '_s credit_card like almost $_000 bucks to travelocity , then i went to the hotel and they took my personal card for incidentals ... a week_later i find out that billed my credit_card $_000 !
negative	that sucks !
negative	i had to dispute the charge w_/ my company what a waste of time i would have thought travelocity would do something to ensure there is no confusion at the hotels at checkout .
negative	i '_ve used hotels . com a million times but thought i ' d try travelocity ... not happening again !
negative	did not receive product but found out it was delivered to another address as per tracking .
negative	the usps would not accept any responsibility for a mis_- delivery & when i called to inform you about non_- delivery i was accused of " stealing the item "!!!
negative	very nasty on telephone & absolutely no customer service !
negative	first off i '_m american and i had previously used this site to unlock my htc one x and now i hav another htc but by a different provider now i looked through this site to make_sure my phone was compatible .
negative	i tried really hard to find out what type of phone i had seeing as how i bout it off the street .
negative	it '_s clean !
negative	and the seller didn_'_t know the name so i looked and looked for a beats audio htc by verizon and piped up the sensation xe .
negative	so the xe dose not appear on the list of phones they can '_t unlock but also don_'_t appear on the list they can unlock .
negative	although they have the option to search for a phone that dose not appear on the unlock able list .
negative	so i buy the code and enter my eime number and they send me a code but it don_'_t work .
negative	yah know they stated i am in the wrong and won_'_t even give me back my ten_dollars .....
negative	sorry ass ppl
negative	took my money as if had part then down road refunded to me funds with no_explanation .
negative	checked website and they still list having part .
negative	makes me suspect some kind of fraud .
negative	have friends who warned me about problems they have had with them such as wrong parts sent and problems with returning these parts for credit .
negative	read their blogs for details .
negative	the quick run down :
negative	asked for link for requested item .
negative	received email for item shipped ( with no options ) totaling_$_00 . 00 .
negative	purchased $_00 . 00 only to find out after purchase that it would take 0 - 00 days to get .
negative	i sent an_email over asking to help with other shipping options .
negative	response email said they had no other options for shipping on this item .
negative	i received the item the next_day to my surprise .
negative	they charged me $_000 . 00 (!)
negative	without my authorization or to my knowledge .
negative	after_contacting them they said i talked to them on the phone and authorized it .
negative	partsgeek does not have or list a phone_number - after that lie i took matters into my own hands .
negative	i will not do_business again with such terrible communicators and liars .
negative	syntes god nok_ikke det_var godt !
negative	goods are fine and the price is excellent but i was charged £_00 to deliver a basin .
negative	no sympathy or concern from better_bathrooms .
negative	apparently ceramics have to go on a mini pallet .
negative	try [_link ] where delivery is free for goods over £_00 and ceramics aren_'_t a problem apparently .
negative	shan '_t be coming_back here again .
negative	the part i ordered was in stock and took 00 days to receive .
negative	this will be the last time i order anything from here .
negative	it shipped ups then was transferred to usps .
negative	the tracking_number was emailed to me the day after i paid but the tracking was not available till the following_day .
negative	so i pay , the money comes out of my account , and my part does not ship for three_days , then takes 0 more days to be delivered .
negative	this is poor service for an internet business in the year 0000 .
negative	i ordered frame on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i received an_email with invoice on time that they have charged by credit_card .
negative	i also received an_email on 00 / 00 / 00 from marcie that this is a special order frame and it will take 00 additional days .
negative	today its been 00 days and i have neither received my frame nor an_email communication from frames_direct about update .
negative	i have been waiting ...
negative	rajesh
negative	i bought a part from partsgeek on - line catalog and the part did not fit the application the catalogue claimed it would .
negative	there isn_'_t a published number to call , and emails are answered automatically .
negative	i sent emails requesting a personal response and a phone_number , but they went_unanswered .
negative	i was unable to inform them that the problem was with their catalog and not with my ordering skills .
negative	i was able to return the part , but got stuck with the shipping in both directions .
negative	this was my first and last purchase from partsgeek and i wouldn_'_t recommend this site to anyone i know based on my experience .
negative	i rented a car from rentalcars . com that i were to pick_up in barcelona_airport , spain .
negative	the company that did the actual renting of the car is called firefly .
negative	i prepaid the rental and were told that i would get a free extra driver and it was also indicated that the necessary insurances were paid for as well .
negative	but when i showed_up to pick_up the car , they told me that i had to pay for the extra driver , but that it would include all holders of a drivers licence in the car .
negative	they also told me that the insurance that were included in the price i had prepaid , didnt cover anything and if i didnt wanna risk loosing my deposit i had to buy their extra insurance .
negative	finally they handed me the car with a full_tank of highly overpriced petrol / gasoline .
negative	all in all i had to pay more than double the amount i had paid at home in front of my computer .
negative	i knew from earlier car renting experiences that prices blow up at pick_up , but i have never experienced such a scamming price increase .
negative	i am furious !
negative	and the question about the extra driver must be illegal .
negative	the homepage did and still do ( i just checked it ) inform you that an extra driver is included at no extra_cost .
negative	i found out that that was a scam , and i had to pay if we wanted to be more than one driver .
negative	no contact with parts_geek the phone_number listed listed there is never an answer just automated prompts ; it very hard to contact automation this system sucks i lost 000 . 00 dollars with this company i strongly don_'_t suggest this company no personal contact just get your money and gone try calling a order in and see what happens get ready to hosed !!!!
negative	!
negative	the communication was totally inadequate .
negative	no one to speak with one the phone .
negative	multi_- day delay in receiving emails .
negative	return_policy very burdensome and costly .
negative	would not purchase fr this company again .
negative	i have bought about a dozen cartridges from inkfarm .
negative	0 did not ever print one page .
negative	when i complained they suggested that i run the printhead cleaning program .
negative	i did that and still nothing .
negative	i will not buy more from inkfarm !
negative	!
negative	i booked a car through priceline , and when i got to the location over 0000 miles_away , the rental company refused to rent the car to be because i was using a prepaid_card .
negative	so here i am 0000 miles_away from home with no car , i booked the reservation with the card that i was picking it up with , priceline had no indicators that the prepaid_card might be an issue , they have no problem stating about the holds that the company could place on your card but not that a prepaid_card could not be used , i contacted priceline and the only_thing they offered was a refund .
negative	i was stuck at the airport with no car .
negative	what an embarrassment .
negative	i contacted family finally to help and tried to get priceline to make and adjustment on who '_s name it was under and they refused .
negative	what kind of customer service is that .
negative	i will never use priceline , and will be telling all that i know of this experience .
negative	purchased a groupon deal but sadly they never sent anything even after emailing them several_times .
negative	will never use or recommend them .
negative	have been using myprotein for years , sometimes had the odd forgivable glitch but sadly my last order was the last_straw .
negative	i made a mistake with the postage option , the default is always the most expensive , i forgot to change it the free option ( was isn_'_t the free option defaulted if you meet the criteria ?)
negative	i cancelled online within 0 minutes of my mistake and called within 00_minutes to make_sure everything was " good " with my cancellation .
negative	the call to the service agent was terrible , although he was english the line was terrible i could hardly hear a thing .
negative	but i was advised to wait for a cancellation email , which never came till after i had a despatch notification .
negative	i did put in a ticket which was closed without myself being_able to again explain that although i had an error why couldn_'_t myprotein just change the delivery option ?
negative	very bad from myprotein .
negative	extremely dissatisfied with the company and specifically becky s .
negative	i ordered these glasses on 0 / 00 / 00 through sears storefront .
negative	i never received the glasses i ordered and was asked if i wanted another color and was threatened to have to pay a 00_% cancellation_fee if i canceled the order at this point .
negative	i chose to go with another color .
negative	i never received the other color .
negative	i was told a day before the next color was due that they were also out of this color .
negative	this company actually tried to purchase glasses back from me ( which were never delivered in the first place ).
negative	i wouldn_'_t have any confidence that this company actually delivers new product .
negative	after i never received the order becky offered to pay for the glasses if i could find them elsewhere online .
negative	through this process becky mocked me , the customer , and was overall very discourteous belittling other_companies which outperformed her own .
negative	as expected i have not received this payment and upon 0 follow_up email requests for this payment , in which i was never less_than courteous , was threatened to be reported to " austin pd " for harassment .
negative	when then got you they got you .
negative	i placed an order on july 0 , 0000 . for a supplement for my elderly cat .
negative	it still has not arrived .
negative	that is all i have to say about that .
negative	i ordered the part and fedex spent several days trying to figure_out what to do with it and finally left it at the post_office .
negative	after i got the part it was the wrong part so now i have to go through the process of sending it back .
negative	so you can send me the one i ordered .
negative	i will be leaving on a trip the end of the month and i needed that part .
negative	ordered some gear on the 00 jan , delivery date was quoted as 00 feb , got a email on the 00th_feb saying my order was being shipped , on the 00th i contacted them saying it had not arrived , apparently the order came back to the depot as it was unable to be delivered , my father is the local postman so delivery is not the issue , got an other email_saying it was reshipped on the 00 feb .
negative	still no package , i '_ve sent an_email_requesting for somebody to call me back , still no reply either by email or call , my friend who ordered the same gear is in the exact_same position as me , he has now been told he has to wait_until the 00 march before package is declared missing , were going skiing on the 0th_march .
negative	wheres the order and why won_'_t anyone call me back ?
negative	?
negative	based on good reviews , i ended_up paying £_00 for 0 months of coverage .
negative	towards the end of my policy i wrote asking for a 0 day extension to the policy as my homebound flight had changed ...
negative	i expected that i would be charged a pro rata rate for the extra days .
negative	alas no , i was quoted £_00 for the extra for days .
negative	as it turns_out they were unable to simply extend my policy , they needed to issue me a new one for the extra days for which there was a minimum policy cost .
negative	via customer_services i asked for an explanation to this ridiculous policy or for someone to contact me to discuss .
negative	unfortunately the person i spoke to was either unable or unwilling and i '_ve been left with the generic customer complains number instead .
negative	so beware .
negative	if you don_'_t need customer service , maybe this is the right place to order , otherwise if some thing wrong with your order or they have send you a wrong part
negative	good lock .
negative	i got a recommendation to this product have disappointed about the delievery service ..
negative	it took over 0_weeks in the middle of winter for the heater_core for my car to arrive .
negative	the part was transferred through two different carriers to get here .
negative	this company is a joke and i will never order from them again .
negative	if you like misleading advertising , slow shipping and broken parts .
negative	eeuroparts is for you .
negative	they will charge you credit_card before shipping and they don_'_t even have the part in stock .
negative	they are bad_news .. you have been warned .
negative	everything about the service was great .
negative	however , after wearing the glasses , which i love , for only one week , the glasses fell_apart .
negative	the glasses are " drilled " frameless oakley keel glasses .
negative	the bridge fell out of the lenses .
negative	very disappointed as these were expensive glasses .
negative	i can '_t tell because my bumper has not arrived .
negative	today .
negative	is .
negative	june .
negative	00 who is in charge of .
negative	shipping ?
negative	you guys messed_up my trip and try to charge me to fix it and wen i wanted a refund u guys tried to charge me for a credit yawll are scam artist and have poor service i will neva use u guys ever again
negative	pretty simple .
negative	i purchased a key .
negative	the process for billing my account went_smoothly .
negative	then , when i went to download the key , everything_went_downhill .
negative	i was told i needed to authenticate my information by receiving a code through my cell_phone and typing it into the website .
negative	i initially thought this was dubious , and it was .
negative	first , the site said they couldn_'_t use my cell_phone because it was " prepaid " my cell_phone is paid month - to - month as i '_m not under contract .
negative	okay , so i clicked the button for an_alternative option .
negative	i was told i would receive an_email with instructions for what i needed to do to " authenticate " myself .
negative	i never received this email .
negative	i used their " support " system and never received a response .
negative	it '_s now been 0 days and still no word from this site .
negative	i '_ve realized that i didn_'_t follow the cardinal rule with the internet ; when something seems too good to be true , it probably is .
negative	i asked for a refund and still_haven_'_t received any response .
negative	the only_thing left is to get my bank to reverse the transaction .
negative	in short : stay_away from this company , it '_s a scam !
negative	when i got the part it was the wrong one , due to the website having a different description for the part i needed , then trying to call this number is hell , i never got anybody to answer despite waiting on hold for hours , through emails im asked to return the part at my expense , minus restocking_fee , i hope this company goes bankrupt in a hurry , worst place ever
negative	after_placing an order online , 0wd sent me the wrong color bikini top for my wrangler .
negative	to make_matters worse , customer service first tried to make me believe that i would have to pay return shipping cost .
negative	after i obviously refused to pay the return shipping on the incorrect part , the customer service person put me on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	when she was back on the line she rapidly and less_than thorough explained the return merchandise process and did everything but hang_up on me .
negative	very unimpressed .
negative	order from quadratec !
negative	it may be a little more_expensive , the the customer service is by_far exception compared to 0wd . com
negative	00 blazer parts are not the same as truck parts so everything i got does not fit everybody gets 0 shot and you guys missed it
negative	terrible company , there mistake sending me the wrong part , they stuck this little plastic part in 0ft 0inch box full of stuffing charge me 0 dollars for shipping then refuse to pay return shipping told me shipp it back at my expense the post_office would not take the box that big , ups and fedex told me to bring it to there store which was over 00 miles from my house .
negative	so i put it in smaller 00inch box post_office charge me 00 . 00 to shipp it back .
negative	i have 00 . 00 in 00 . 00 item that was wrong item at my expense .
negative	never never again with geek will i do_business .
negative	we will never use this website again , because they unfairly advertised a reservation as a 0 - star_hotel and we selected it on that basis .
negative	they placed us in a four star_hotel .
negative	we were very upset with this false_advertising and as a result we would suggest that you steer_clear of this website .
negative	dr . vincent j . contreras
negative	i told the sales_person what product i needed and was told a like model was available and i purchased it as the product was hard to find since sandy hit .
negative	the model i purchased was different i needed a powervented model and was sold a atmospheric model .
negative	i have not received my purchase as of today , poor delivery process .
negative	do not buy from this company !!!!
negative	sent my eyeglasses back because they were too small and the frames were bent .
negative	they charged my $_000 for the lenses and i have nothing !!!
negative	!
negative	i will_continue post everywhere i can about this unethical rip_off company !!!
negative	!
negative	rep we ordered from was fired and company left us hanging - no info at all .
negative	i had to make dozen ( s ) calls to pursue .
negative	next rep held on like a bulldog to this order and i nearly had a breakdown before the sofa arrived many weeks_later and way too many excuses .
negative	even the delivery promised by email and fine on was botched .
negative	but the guys who brought it did make it right .
negative	i would never recommend anyone order furniture this way !!
negative	!
negative	$_000 a month for positive_reviews ?
negative	my business doesn_'_t pay resellerratings and i just got an_email_saying all of the reviews we have on reseller ratings will be removed from google reviews unless we pay the $_000 monthly_fee .
negative	to me , that '_s flirting with extortion and i for one , will not accept this action .
negative	as a small business_owner i can '_t afford it .
negative	it also makes me seriously_consider the validity of reseller ratings authenticity .
negative	this web_site sucks ... big time .
negative	i placed an order and a few hours_later they emailed me that my order was on hold due to a billing_address problem with my credit_card .
negative	ok , so i went back to the website to get a phone_number to call them .
negative	no phone_number listed on the web_site .
negative	i returned to the email and same thing .
negative	no phone_number listed .
negative	so , i returned to the website to search for some way to contact them .
negative	i finally found a place to open a " support_ticket ".
negative	i explained that the billing_address on the order was correct and verified this in writing and sent the support_ticket in .
negative	a few hours_later they sent me another email_saying the same thing .
negative	i sent another response telling them i would give them one last chance to get my business , but they never responded .
negative	i went to another website and ordered my part with same credit_card and had it next_day .
negative	i emailed them back and told them to cancel my order and they would never hear from me again .
negative	the absolute worst customer service i have ever_experienced in my life .
negative	i would recommend anyone over them in a heartbeat .
negative	i have used several sites like this in the past and had no troubles at all , so when i ordered something from these_guys i was not expecting the hassle i ended_up with , after a 00 minite wait for my code i got a little note_saying payement was decline .
negative	this made no sense as i knew i had sufficiant funds to make the transaction so i logged_into my bank to see that the money had been taken anyway ( this was confirmed by the bank advisor i spoke too ) could be an honest mistake so i phone them .
negative	this is when i was told that i failed thier security check - this is odd as i have lived at the same address since 0000 i work full time , have a credit_card etc i was born and raised in england plus had the same email address for over a decade .
negative	of course they wouldnt tell me how i failed the checks but the fact they still took the money is unacceptable , if im no good my moneys no good and now i cant use the money elsewhere because its gone until they return it 0 - 0 days they say .
negative	a complete joke of a company .
negative	there are many sites like this and my advise is to use one of them to avoid anything like this happening to you .
negative	the wrong order was sent to me .
negative	i have used echo for a really long time and their service has always been great .
negative	however after my latest order they called to say two of the items were not in stock so they would cancel the other two items and i would have to order both items separately and pay the extra shipping myself !!
negative	!
negative	do your self a favour and order from discount_supplements cheaper prices and free shipment without having to deal with the rude owner !
negative	i have ordered in the past and was very happy .
negative	i recently made a order and soon found out i didn_'_t need the part .
negative	for 0 days at 0 hrs on speaker each day i never got through .
negative	and i was using the make new order option .
negative	that is horrible .
negative	i sent many emails to get a response 0 days_later after i already rejected the order .
negative	horrible .
negative	the part was here in 0 days since you had my money lets_see how long the refund takes .
negative	then i will be charged a restock_fee .
negative	horrible .
negative	the broadband service we had had since renewing our contract has_been terrible , went from having 000mb to 00mb !
negative	0 fix dates been and gone , no e_-_mails no phone_calls , when i contact technical_support they dont even want to know what the ref number is .
negative	they just want to stick to their " iam a thick agent " script .
negative	i would advise avoiding this company like a bargepole .
negative	no_idea why you sent this .
negative	i do not recognize the name pureformulas . com .
negative	the part arrived damaged , with the box broken open .
negative	i sent it back with the ups guy and they said via_email that they would refund only the cost of the part and not the shipping .
negative	they should pay the cost of shipping since i did not damage the part .
negative	additionally , they have a toll_free number for customer service but it '_s a big scam .
negative	no one ever answers it .
negative	this is pure bullshit !!
negative	!
negative	another thing : they said that they would refund the cost of the part but it does not reflect in my bank_statement ..
negative	i simply had to go to my bank to have the transaction withdrawn in order to get my money back from these thieving assholes !!
negative	!
negative	been waiting for this game for ages and pre ordered it .
negative	it still has not arrived .
negative	i had to cancel a trip because something else came up .
negative	there refund policy says that you should get your refund in 0 days .
negative	i called on the eighth day because i had not received my refund .
negative	the customer service person told me it will take 00 business days to receive my refund .
negative	two_weeks longer_than their policy states .
negative	in the mean time i used my debit_card to purchase the trip in the first place which means now i am with my money for a whole month almost a whole month you know what i mean .
negative	so travelers be sure you can go on your vacation .
negative	oh_yea purchasing the insurance doesn_'_t help either if it is not an_emergency you will still lose your money .
negative	part arrived damaged .
negative	unfortunately , i didn_'_t open the package for several days , and their policy says they must be notified immediately .
negative	no exceptions .
negative	i '_ve been here at the tampa airport for over an_hour now waiting for the return shuttle .
negative	nothing like waiting over an_hour to return to your car to drive 0 hrs after driving 0 hrs to an airport then a 0hr .
negative	flight .
negative	this is ridiculous ... first time was 00_mins but i gave them another try ... never again .
negative	they keep raising they rates about every six_months .
negative	for a 0x0x00 it used to be $_00 dollars , then it went up to $_00 a month , then it went to $_00 a month , all within a years time .
negative	the car was supposed to hold 0 people plus luggage .
negative	it barely held 0 plus luggage .
negative	we had to hire a van to pick_up our family from the airport in naples , only use the car for local trips around sorrento without luggage , turn the car in early and hire another van to transport us all back to rome .
negative	and then got charged a drop charge on top of all that .
negative	a total_rip - off !!!
negative	!
negative	my clubs went to florida
negative	i was in arizona
negative	bought a concealed shower which was advertised as easy to fit , even to an outside wall .
negative	ok , the mixer was not that easy to fix , but the outlet for the hand_held shower_head is impossible to fit unless you have access from the rear of the wall .
negative	when i encountered the problem i rang bath_empire and asked for the technical_department .
negative	' sorry , we don_'_t have one ' was the reply .
negative	eventually spoke to a woman_who agreed that it was impossible to fit without rear access .
negative	she said that if i was not happy with the product i could return it for a refund .
negative	postage at my expense .
negative	not at all satisfied .
negative	ps can '_t even get my name right !!!
negative	pete evans - jones
negative	i didn_'_t get the part i ordered when i emailed customer service i got no answers !!!
negative	i would rate this comopany a 0 !!
negative	never again will i order
negative	how can i input an isbn number and get the wrong book twice !
negative	you basically suck and i am a third of the way through my class w_/ o text book .
negative	i don_'_t want the study guides !
negative	oh wait ...
negative	if you plan on buying your book used take heed that the book they send could be so trashed that the cover is no_longer a part of the book .
negative	the pages have three hole punches and the remains of the book are inserted into a broken three ring binder .
negative	my mistake .
negative	you only sent me the wrong thing once .
negative	awesome !
negative	not !
negative	missing a part and still_haven_'_t got to me .
negative	over two_weeks and i havnt been able to get in touch with anybody
negative	i had a especial request for an check in time .
negative	the agent supposely worked out for me .
negative	after i got to the hotel i was not done as per my request and i had to go somewhere_else and lost my money .
negative	ok .
negative	i orderd a parts , they did confirmed the availability and that they going to shiped out .
negative	next_day i received an e_mail that it '_s going to be maild out in a feu days_later because it '_s out of stock .
negative	so i sad ok i wait .
negative	i finaly got the parts three_days_later but they sent me the wrong parts that was not even specified for my car .
negative	well i was upset but i sent a couple of e_mails back and forth and they sad to send it back .
negative	now not enough that they sent the wrong parts but they sad i have to pay to get it returned .
negative	so i ask , is this is a rigtly managed business ?
negative	i think not , never going to due business with them again .
negative	very bad_experience .
negative	i will stay with local companies who stay behind they costumers .
negative	made a purchase because i didn_'_t want my credit_card info saved on the site i was buying from and i thought pay_pal was more trust_worthy .
negative	contacted customer_support multiple_times through email and never got a response .
negative	couldn_'_t get it linked my bank_account so i could pay them and by the time i finally got it all sorted_out with out paypals help i had been hit with late charges .
negative	my reservation was not done correctly .
negative	i asked for a pet friendly room on the first floor and none of this information transferred through to the motel .
negative	luckily , i called earlier on the day of arrival to verify late arrival and found out about the missing advice to the motel .
negative	this is unacceptable and will keep me from ever using the reservation service again limiting my use to only comfort inns for which i can find a direct number .
negative	since this is not easily done on the comfort_inn web_page , i will not be using comfort inns in the future .
negative	i really rate a company by the ease with which they make the management of your account : talk - talk make this absolute hell and i think their " loyalty team " must be trained in the art of frustration .
negative	i wanted to cancel my account as i '_ve emigrated but , having called three_times ( when the line " randomly " seemed to disconnect when i got through ) and waited for an_eternity , was told that they had to do an investigation to see if i was allowed to cancel my line and could call back in 0 - days , after which i could only then give 0 - days notice to cancel .
negative	i have now done this and what a sense of relief it is not be saddled with this horrid company , that treats its customers so very poorly , anymore .
negative	if you ever get " brian " to talk to at their call_centre : run a mile !
negative	sick , unhelpful attitude - i '_m sure they '_ll make him management .
negative	if you ' re reading this and considering them - pay more to anyone_else !
negative	it '_s worth it .
negative	we were based at the st pancras reneissance hotel and we had no information as to where the bus_stops were and no else knew where they as a result we had to get a taxi down to the london_eye we then came out of the eye and thought we would go on the river_trip and were told we had to go on the bus trip first by then the big_bus was a bad smell and had to get taxis for the rest of our stay the foyer that sold big_bus tickets could only tell us of one stop across the river that she knew of . we did download the so called map from your web and had to go speksavers to read it
negative	haven_'_t received my item and the tracking_number doesn_'_t work .
negative	xxxxxxxxxxxl ; ldfmwrjgwegebnwejhjbzasnwgnsx
negative	you can '_t add a foreign bank_account without changing your address to the appropriate country , and the site won_'_t allow you to change your address to any other country at all .
negative	the only way is to open a second paypal_account .
negative	and by then , paypal will block the card you '_ve tried to assign the first account - rendering it useless altogether .
negative	then , as a scam , if you try to use your original domestic bank_account for a foreign purchase via_paypal , they insist on converting funds between currencies themselves , at exorbitant rates , without giving you the option to choose your own institutions provided rate .
negative	" pay your way ".
negative	yeah , right .
negative	apparently the code for battlefield_0 they gave_me was not real , and ea themselves stated that the retailer you have purchased the game have generated the illegal key .
negative	so now i am out 00 bucks , because cjs -_cdkeys . com generated an illegal key and gave it to me , great real awesome , if i could 0 starts would be the way to go
negative	customer service is terrible , this business of having a customer wait 00 - 00hrs ( which was always 00hrs ) is unacceptable .
negative	i took my business to a competitor and had the parts the next_day , so if you get an order put on hold because of billing , the problem lies with parts_geek not you .
negative	i amazes_me how a place like this can stay in business .
negative	i will never use this company again !
negative	!
negative	just a few_days after receiving my notice that i had been placed on academic probation , i received an_email from honorsociety . org saying that i was accepted to their " honor society ."
negative	i gave it some time before i decided to join , and i joined under the assumption that they had not yet received notice that my gpa was 0 . 000 and were accepting me on the basis of my high_school gpa ( 0 . 000 ) and the fact that i had been accepted to another honor society on campus ( which i had joined during the semester , so the only gpa information that was available then was my high_school gpa , as it was my first semester of college ).
negative	however , i found out a few_days after joining that honorsociety . org is not affiliated with my university , nor any other university , nor the association of college honor societies .
negative	in response , i requested my account cancelled and my money back .
negative	the next_day , i received an_email_saying that my account cancellation and refund had been processed and i will not be charged again .
negative	i am holding them to that and if they make any charges to my account , i will have to contact my bank about it .
negative	there have been other complaints about honorsociety . org charging accounts without notice or permission , and if that happens to me even_though i already cancelled my honorsociety . org account , i will contact my bank , and i suggest that anyone_else who gets wrongly charged as such , whether currently members or cancelled , contacts their banks and that anyone_who is currently a member cancels .
negative	for everyone_else , if you receive an acceptance letter from honorsociety . org , ignore the email and do not give them your credit / debit_card information .
negative	i had to cancel my flight , so i called in and told them about that .
negative	they said that they could return dkk 0000 out of my dkk 0000 plane_ticket .
negative	that was all fine , but after a week i hadn_'_t received any money , so i e_- mailed them and asked them .
negative	they then said that they could only return dkk 000 instead .
negative	i then had a long e_-_mail exchange with them , where they often didn_'_t answer for more than a week .
negative	in the end , they found out that they could only give me the dkk 000 .
negative	i will never use expedia again .
negative	this is the worst customer service i have ever received , and i am very disappointed .
negative	there are other_places that offer cheap tickets too .
negative	find them , and use them instead .
negative	my order came in incomplete !
negative	no mention as to when the balance ot the order will be in !
negative	also , no phone # listed so that i can call to find out when the balance of my order will be here !
negative	poor customer service as far as i am comcerned !
negative	take ya money quick fob you off saying its the post_office we sent it to ya bull ant got it don_'_t exspex it to turn up either massive company i will be like most over looked in this matter like always thanks alot thanks ....
negative	i bought a bike , they withdrawed my money , after a week of not hearing anything from them i tried to contact them , just to find out that my bike is ' nt in stock !
negative	after about a month of annoying slow correspondence with them i finally get my bike , and now im struggling to get 00 pounds out of them which i have in writing that they will transfer and they do owe me .
negative	horrible costumer service they send me wrong part
negative	i ordered a radiator for a 0000_mercedes 000sdl .
negative	the radiator received has the transmission coolling connections on the right side of the radiator .
negative	the transmission cooling lines should be on the bottom of the radiator .
negative	ordered the ink_cartridge two_weeks_ago and have not yet received it .
negative	when you indicate an expectation of 0 to 0 days this is unacceptable .
negative	i would have never ordered this cartridge if i knew it would take this long .
negative	also no correspondence from as to where the cartridge
negative	this is an awful site .
negative	do not waste your time !
negative	!
negative	i wish the picture would have been clear ... i ordered the wrong grill because of a bad picture .
negative	.. now i '_m stuck with wrong grill .... if i returned it would cost me more in shipping
negative	i got caliper rebuilt kit that was supposedly for my car , but in reality it was just pile of rubber and random metal rings that did not fit my car .
negative	waste of money !
negative	ordered a part from them and a week_later i get email_saying they are refunding my money .
negative	at_least they did that , have no_idea why i was refunded .
negative	i rented a car on the phone in the us to be picked_up in venice italy , and the person that took_care of me on the phone was actually really professional and knowledgeable .
negative	however , the car they gave_me over there had an expired ( aseguranza ) its like a form of insurance they use in italy , a sticker on the windshield .
negative	i was stopped by a cop and although after half an_hour of going back and fourth in my bad italian , i was not given a ticket , the procedure for that offense in italy is $_000 . 00 euros and they tow your car .
negative	i complained to the avis person when i returned the car , and she said " sorry , they forgot to change it ".
negative	another thing is they gave_me a first generation gps that kept loosing signal so i constantly had to stop and wait for it to regained the signal in order for me to drive .
negative	i was not happy nor pleased with my experience at all .
negative	no fulfillment of my order - the gave_me a " refund ' with no_explanation whatsoever .
negative	no support , no message about why - just a refund .
negative	they ' re shipping_costs are outrageous , and they ' re high score on this site is fabricated because they offer a free spot in a drawing if you post a good review ... isn_'_t that kinda ...
negative	cheating ?
negative	?
negative	will be going back to my old supplement supplier ( the biggest one on the net - you can probably guess who ).
negative	they aren_'_t perfect either - but they ' re actually cheaper most of the time , without the outrageous shipping that this company charges .
negative	booked our transfer from gatwick to london and return before leaving home with an idea that the sevice was reliable .
negative	when arriving to gatwick we easyli found the busstop , but from there it went all bad .
negative	we waited over an_hour , being rejected from four different busses that drove_away empty or almost empty , and the busdrivers didn_'_t even took a glance at our tickets , the only response was , there will be another bus in 00_minutes ( all four times ), and as we stood waiting more passengers piled up at the busstop all with tickets and no busses .
negative	so after waiting 0½ hour after our planned bus departure we gave up waiting and found other transportation .
negative	as we were to go to back to gatwick for the plane home , we showed_up 00_minutes before the planned departure to gatwick in the hope that our first experience just was one bad day for easybus .
negative	but no .... again we were rejected from our reservated bus , allthough the driver picked_up two very beautyful girls for 00 £ cash , but we who had tickets to the bus could not get on .
negative	again the driver said there would be a bus every 00_minutes , so we could just take the next one .
negative	well 00_minutes later there came another bus , which this time insisted to take the passengers with bookings for his shift , and again said we should wait an_additional " 00_minutes ".
negative	at this time we reached a point were we would miss our plane if we did not get some kind of transport to the airport , wich we also told the last driver , but never the less he refused to help finding a solution for us .
negative	so in the end , we again had to find another way to get to the airport .
negative	overall we were left with a feeling that we had been hustled for the cost of the tickets like you would expect in the third world , and not a company that wants to be taken seriuos .
negative	so if you go to london and want to be sure of your transport , do not use this company .
negative	take one of the other reliable services in stead .
negative	great price but u have to wait forever , he '_ll is the stuff coming to me on a slow boat from china
negative	bought brand_new " premium " brake_drums from you .
negative	they were both out of round !!!!
negative	had to spend an_additional $_00 to have them turned .
negative	think you should send me my money back due to a lousy product !
negative	will never buy from you again .
negative	thank_you very little
negative	so i order a part you tell me it is on the way ... then you cancel the order because you can '_t come up with the part ... your system was clumsy ... no point doing_business with you folks when there are so many great options , i can waste my own time ... good by ... dan
negative	this website wants me to review their service before the deal is even complete .
negative	i have no_idea how this will turn out yet .
negative	took 0 days to send the part one state away and they sent the wrong part .
negative	i '_m not happy and i '_m not sure i '_ll order from them again .
negative	i ordered hatch strut ( s ) for my trailblazer .
negative	they have a couple of different_types , i came_across one that is on ad listed as position : left and right .
negative	i chose that part number and ordered it .
negative	i recieved a box that would easily hold 0 struts but the box only contained one .
negative	when i questioned them they said i only ordered one .
negative	no , i ordered a left and right which implys two items .
negative	i ordered a door_latch cable for my aunts 00 silverado and the price was very good but the new part only lasted 0_weeks .
negative	sure they are supposed to be sending me a new one .
negative	but who is going to install the new part then in order for a refund i must pay the return shipping on the broken item .
negative	where is the savings ???
negative	?
negative	spent 0 hours waiting and changing between 0 cars before they could get me something , despite having pre_- booked 0 month ahead .
negative	i needed 0 things : aircon and gps .
negative	first car : nobody could open it ( apparently was new ).
negative	second car also new , aircon not working .
negative	0rd car gps not working .
negative	they then gave_me a standalone gps , which didn_'_t work either ( didn_'_t get satellite position at all ), i had to come_back and get another gps before i could finally be on my way .
negative	in all this , alone with my 0 kids i had to walk back and forth a good dozen of times between the parking_lot and the desk which were far away from each other , simply because they would not send anybody out their office to help solve the problems .
negative	i think this should be put out of business .
negative	they charged me $_00 . 00 & never told me that there was going to be an added fee other than the room charge .
negative	it is definitely a scam & should be put out of business .
negative	having used the big_bus_tour previously i decided to use again on a short trip to london
negative	firstly i had issues booking online and making payment
negative	i emailed customer_services and still_await a reply to see if the original booking was successful , eventually after 0 days i was able to make an online booking and still no email response
negative	my second issue was a few stops had been put out of service due to roadwork '_s , however we were not informed of this at any time during the tour until we noticed .
negative	thirdly on our homeward leg , and on a tight_schedule we were told the bus would have to wait 00mins at a stop , the same bus we had waited 00_minutes for a stop to board ,
negative	all in all an unpleasant_experience for the money we had paid .
negative	ordered two parts and received same .
negative	one part was previously used and one part was packaged incorrectly .
negative	no big_deal when you shop online you expect problems from time to time .
negative	what separates vendors on the web are those that stand_behind their products and services and provide good customer_services and those that do not .
negative	my advice , never order a product from a website that doesn_'_t have a 0 - 000 customer service number .
negative	out of 0 fem a bomb not a one poped , better off throwing the money away .
negative	i bought the led collar that was black with pink led '_s we used the collar that nite to find out the light was bright at battery end an not visible at other end .
negative	i did call and you were great an sent another one out to me .
negative	we just opened package an this one doen not even lite at all .
negative	i think these products schould be checked before shipping to advoid angry coustermers
negative	on of the poorest companies i have dealt_with for some time .
negative	they will not answer telephones when inquires are directed at them , they do not respond to their little comment notes they ask you to send and , in general , are a very poor customer service business .
negative	their service in sending items once ordered leaves a lot to be desired .
negative	i will let you know how they handle returns as most of the items i ordered are going back .
negative	ordered system on 0 / 00 , delivery estimated by 0 / 00 .
negative	at 0pm ct on 0 / 00 , i called to find out where my order is .
negative	i got an_email back 0hr later , here is the full text ;
negative	fedex tracking xxxxxxxx
negative	checked the tracking , the package was picked_up by fedex 00mins after my call .
negative	fedex estimates delivery on 0 / 0 .
negative	almost 0_weeks after the order , with no communication from portatech since the order .
negative	no attempt to explain , no attempt to make it right .
negative	there '_s lots of barebones vendors out there , i '_ll be trying one of them next time .
negative	who are you ?
negative	your email does not indicate the name of the company or the service .
negative	i was further mislead by being told that i could make a reservation confirmed by my amex card and could then , when my hhonors points were transferred , have them moved to the hotel to cover my stay previously guaranteed by amex .
negative	i would ' nt recommend partsgeek for anything they screwed_up the shipping on the manual i ordered it never came to me came to my post_office 0 :_00am then was returned to sender at 00 :_00pm from post_office .
negative	the post_office said the shipping lablel was the problem .
negative	so i emailed partsgeek to see what the problem was and they said they got it back but would not reship because it cost to much and they would refund purchase price only not the shipping cost but i could reorder and pay shipping again .
negative	now almost a week_later still_waiting for my refund
negative	extremly upset clint
negative	i live in the usvi i order many things over internet and ship direct to me .
negative	i do not get what is the big_deal shipping to the virgin islans we are american and you can use the us_postal service flat_rate boxes om internet and they do the rest .
negative	you use the internet i fi d your company narrow minded .
negative	thiink out of the box .
negative	people that live on islands need this service the most .
negative	very dissapointed with the response received from your company .
negative	i made a mistake in my dates so called the 000 number to make_changes within 0 hour .
negative	the 0st receptionist indicated , in poor_english , they couldn_'_t find my reservation and i needed to call the hotel direct .
negative	i called the hotel direct and they found my reservation but because it was made thru this service they could not help me change the dates .
negative	i then called back and again got a poor_english_speaking person_who told me they are located in central_america .
negative	she also told me they could not find my reservation and therefore i cannot help you .
negative	now all i want to do is cancel this reservation and deal directly with ramada in hancock , mi .
negative	well i '_ve ordered parts from parts_geek because they had the best prices .
negative	but who would of knew that that i wouldn_'_t receive some of parts .
negative	and good luck trying to call them no number .
negative	and what parts that i got are no good without the part they didn_'_t send wtf !
negative	i sure hope bbb will close them down for good
negative	first of all , you ave my name wrong , your sales_person was so happy to just make the sale that she didn_'_t care of any spelling to be correct ...
negative	the name should be david berger .
negative	also this should of been under a company name
negative	this has_been , without a doubt , the worst customer service experience i '_ve ever had .
negative	expedia has_been showing their incompetence repeatedly .
negative	they '_ve run my credit_card 00 times .
negative	obviously , the bank put a fraud hold on my card .
negative	now , expedia has a hold on my ( ironically enough ,) expedia mastercard and i can '_t get them to release it .
negative	basically , i now can '_t afford to go with anyone_else because there '_s an authorized hold on that card .
negative	oh , and i '_ve been on hold for a total of 0 hours and 00_minutes since monday ...
negative	these_people sell goods they don_'_t actually yet have but charge you and refuse to refund you .
negative	avoid
negative	after claiming the codes for bf0 would be up " soon " they went on to dsay much later :
negative	" cjs_cd_keys standard_edition eu arrival tomorrow morning expected ."
negative	do not buy from this lying company .
negative	having owned an airram for some time and very happy i decided to buy another , a multi and a trimmer .
negative	what a mistake .
negative	the multi does not recharge , ok there is a fault .
negative	the problem is how gtec put it right .
negative	i called customer service at 0am to explain the problem and was told to expect a call back .
negative	at 0pm i called again and was cut_off .
negative	called again and was told call_backs take 0 hours and i could not be put through to a service agent .
negative	asked to speaker to a supervisor who told me the same but would get someone to call me .
negative	you guessed it , two hours_later no call back .
negative	why do this to your customers , service is so easy especially when you get something wrong , win the customer over .
negative	never again , horrible service .
negative	shame on you !
negative	i couldn_'_t click on the image and pick the right color and you sent me the wrong color .
negative	and there '_s no return information in the package
negative	i will admit that they sent me the parts i had ordered , whoever once they arrived i realized that the dealer had told me the wrong rotor size for my suv .
negative	that is when i realized that partsgeek did not put the same effort into service after the sale .
negative	you can '_t talk to a live_person and the email solution they give you is very slow to respond .
negative	once you return a product , ( on your dime ) it takes 0 - 00 days for them to give you back your money on your credit_card .
negative	while my purchase was only $_000_dollars , think of the hundreds of orders that they keep money held up on .
negative	i won_'_t do_business with this company anymore , not when there are other_companies that have better customer_support .
negative	bought and paid for a simple turn_signal .
negative	never received the part , but charge appeared on my credit_card .
negative	now it is a pure process of finding who will answer the phone at customer service to actually help .
negative	order from them in the past and all was fine , but now i realize why the brick and mortor stores still have a place in the world .
negative	i received an offer of a 00_%_discount and tried to apply the discount_code unsuccessfully 0 times .
negative	eventually the cd department asked me to pay the full price and assured me that my discount would be applied soon after ?
negative	it wasn_'_t , it hasn_'_t been yet and the experience has_been very poor and extremely frustrating .
negative	i do not trust this company and won_'_t be using them again .
negative	my advice ...... find a reputable_company that cares_about it '_s customers .
negative	parts_geek sucks said they had my fuel_pump for ford_f000 took my money right_away 0days later e maild me said they never had part took 0 days to refund i will never use partsgeek again .
negative	complete rip_off !!!!!
negative	won_'_t accept goods and now won_'_t return them !!!
negative	asked to be allowed to collect , not allowed !!!
negative	con_artists !!!
negative	!
negative	i was shipped a used part ... hole in the bag , no instructions , clearly heat damaged .
negative	then told i had to pay for return shipping .
negative	i will never use parts_geek again .
negative	i ' d be_careful when ordering from this company as they sent me the wrong part .
negative	the currency_exchange_rate provided was not accurate .
negative	when i received my credit_card bill it was $_00 more than what was provided .
negative	in addition the currency_exchange charge was $_00 .
negative	while a exchange charge was disclosed this seems excessive for a safe internet based charge .
negative	bottom_line : i thought i was getting a competitive rate but because of the deception / excessive charges : i overpaid by approximately_$_00 per airline ticket or $_00 total .
negative	i will never use ebookers again !
negative	if you order something from them , don_'_t expect much customer service since i sent them an inquiry for the parts that were missing from my order , and i have yet to get a response after almost two_weeks .
negative	i '_m shocked that delivery . com asked me to do this after i told a customer service rep that i planned to quit using the service because i was denied my 0 dollars when my order was short by just . 00_cents .
negative	i made a stupid mistake , yes , but it would '_ve been better business to understand that and cut me a break and keep my business .
negative	said all there is to say .
negative	i would appreciate your sending the blades
negative	i ordered insulin for my pet and it was received late and not refrigerated .
negative	a second batch was sent and i have not yet received it .
negative	two_weeks have gone by .
negative	hi no value for money took weeks for payment and will not use again
negative	i had missed place my ticket and was told to get off the bus .
negative	even_though i had the conformation and refer number of the ticket purchased .
negative	i felt_like second citizen .
negative	the contractor and bus driver were very rude .
negative	i then called the main_office they were not helpful .
negative	i had children under 00 and had take then under ground to our next destination .
negative	one of my child started to cry .
negative	i found the service to be very poor will not use the service again
negative	disappointed with shipping process , would not order from parts_geek again .
negative	i ordered my parts paid for shipping and didn_’ t receive my part until 00 days_later .
negative	my car had to sit broking , when i tried to contact them to inquire_about my order i could only send an_email .
negative	the customer service was poor and impersonal .
negative	if was would have been told up front it would take 00 days for me to receive the part to repair my car i would have purchased my part someplace_else .
negative	parts_geek should have an express shipping program for those willing to pay for it .
negative	i have used ups to return 0 pachages and for some reason after 00 days have only had a refund on one item .
negative	i hesitate to order any more products from you , and have ordered from other auto part company '_s because of this .
negative	i woun '_t order from geek '_s until this mater is resolved .
negative	i tried to order prescription dog_food from this company .
negative	i had untold problems .
negative	they were unable to get the instructions correct , and verify the prescription with the vet .
negative	after three_attempts , i finally had to cancel the order .
negative	got shipped the wrong part took 0_weeks to arrive .
negative	then i was told it was my fault they sent me a part for a different year vehicle .
negative	horrible service and uneducated employees .
negative	i will never order from partsgeek ever .
negative	please order from a more legit company , this one is rude .
negative	we got ripped_off !
negative	couldn_'_t refund or change or date !
negative	i needed a small part , a air pump rubber mount that only cost $_00 and i got all the confirmation e_-_mails and a shipping number and it never showed_up .
negative	i '_m not even sure what happened to it .
negative	it '_s been almost 0_weeks , and i haven_'_t gotten the part or my money back .
negative	buyer_beware !
negative	don_'_t expect to receive whatever you get in a timely_fashion or even at all .
negative	mcm failed to complete my order as paid .
negative	been writing emails to multiple addresses at mcm .
negative	no one will return my emails or complete my order .
negative	feeling very ripped_off !
negative	0 .
negative	ae did not have an agent in downtown trappani as i was assured following a tel .
negative	call , meaning ...
negative	0 . an expensive taxi to trappani airport where ...
negative	0 . an ae agent could not be found .
negative	0 .
negative	i eventually found a europcar .
negative	it was unbelievable that partsgeek would ship a mirror in a box with no bubble_wrap , " styrofoam peanuts " or other packaging material and not expect it to arrive broken .
negative	of course it was broken when it arrived .
negative	what did you expect ?
negative	yes , you did refund my purchase for the purchase price only , but not for the shipping_charges .
negative	however , it took a few_days to go through your unwieldy process of obtaining a support_ticket number and receiving confirmation that you were refunding the purchase price .
negative	i still don_'_t know if you want the mirror returned or not .
negative	laughingly , you put an "( 000 )" number in the e_-_mail you sent to call if i had questions .
negative	have you ever tried_calling the "( 000 )" number ?
negative	the recording says you only communicate via_e_-_mail .
negative	you definitely need better communication .
negative	try hiring a human_being .
negative	i would be very reluctant to use your services again unless i was ordering something that could not possibly be damaged in shipping and which i somehow knew i would never try to return .
negative	i get it , why not make money on everyone right ?
negative	but when you mess something up , and they try to make it out to be the customers fault , how is that good business .
negative	i have no_idea how this will pan out , they aren_'_t getting back to me in a time frame i would think to be " normal ."
negative	what i can say is i am unhappy with the service , and the insinuation that i am incompetent because their computer screen says they sent the right part , which i ordered correctly .
negative	it simply isn_'_t the item i received in the box .
negative	past that , i can explain it as anything other than the wrong item was placed in a box and mailed out .
negative	it would be best for them to just stop with the delays and just get this refund done .
negative	not a good company .
negative	purchased a print when i received it i was very disappointed looked like a posted in a poster frame .
negative	i tried to contact customer service but they have none .
negative	customer_services is only to take your money .
negative	i wanted to exchange print for metal art and wanted to see if the $_00 . 00 i paid for the first print ( way over priced shipping ) would cover the second shipping and they e_- mailed that it would not and i would be charged another 00 . 00 plus i would be out the 00 . 00 to ship it back .
negative	they emailed me back and told me if i did not want to pay to ship it back to just destroy the art work and take pictures of the destroyed product and they would refund me the amount minus the shipping .
negative	so that means to me that the art work is worth about 00 . 00 and not the 000 . 00 plus 00 shipping that they charged .
negative	who runs a business like this .
negative	i would not recommend this company .
negative	they need some schooling on how to communicate with their customer .
negative	i ordered floor_mats for a 0000_jaguar x - type .
negative	the ad said it was " laser cut for a perfect_fit ".
negative	i unpacked the mats when they arrived and discovered that they " sort of " fit .
negative	the interior packing said nothing about about being for any type of car .
negative	by this time , they could not be returned .
negative	if they are going to charge premium prices for laser cut products , i would at_least expect them to actually be made for the car they were ordered for .
negative	i will never do_business with these_people again , and i suggest anyone ordering from them to be aware they '_ll just get whatever this company happens to have on hand .
negative	shopto was , to me , the go to place for video_games , until my 0nd wii_u couldn_'_t connect to the internet , and i was banned from buying consoles from them again .
negative	if anyone has a ps0 pre_- ordered with them , i ' d cancel , if you hear about the problems so_far , and you have two faulty consoles , it '_s bad_news .
negative	i suspect if i returned two of the same game i ' d also be banned from buying games , but anyway , i '_m warning you .
negative	i closed my account after abysmal customer service , my dad used their merchant on play , but i warned him .
negative	hope he has no similar problems .
negative	edit_: now closed my father '_s account due to this , i contacted someone on the phone who was blatantly rude .
negative	he was telling a member of staff saying " i '_ve got him on the phone ."
negative	this disgusts me how a company can act this way , he was saying " i '_ve got to put the phone down now due to other customers waiting ."
negative	more customers with problems , good luck .
negative	after seeing other reviews in the past couple of months , they seem to be banning people left right and centre .
negative	i ' d use someone_else if i were you , as some have gone with having their money completely vanished .
negative	use thegamecollection , zavvi or amazon .
negative	graingergames are good too .
negative	my order was placed almost 0_weeks_ago , i check tracking everyday .

negative	i ordered a camshaft in which your site stated 00 in stock .
negative	i needed it quickly and ordered it overnight shipping .
negative	i ordered it on a saturday and i understand the shipment won_'_t get started till monday , but i expect it to come by wednesday and it didn_'_t show and i got no notification of cancellation and i tried to find a phone_number and found none and had to email and wait another day to find out it was cancelled due to being out of stock .
negative	i ordered it from autopartsnetwork . com for the same price and it arrived today
negative	parts don_'_t work and you try to pass the buck instead of fixing the problem
negative	i ordered a what was supposed to be a new wheel but instead they sent me an old one that was cleaned_up and re - painted .
negative	there was a dent in it and it was obvious there was corrosion pits under the paint .
negative	i could have gotten the same thing at a junk_yard for 0 / 0 of the price .
negative	the word crooks comes to mind .
negative	i ordered several items that took over 0_weeks to get here , even then only half the order came .
negative	when you try to call or email , you get no response except a voice_message .
negative	proceed with caution before buying anthing with them !

negative	i ordered a side_mirror for my vehicle .
negative	i made it known that i needed the passenger '_s side_mirror .
negative	i was sent the driver '_s side_mirror in error by the company .
negative	i sent emails stating this fact , and all i wanted was the correct mirror sent to me .
negative	i returned the one sent in error in hopes of just being sent the one i wanted to begin with .
negative	however , i had to purchase a new one .
negative	i tracked the original one returned to the company and it was received by them on 00 / 00 / 00 and signed for by martin .
negative	to date ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) i still have not been refunded my original $_00 . 00 .
negative	forget trying to get to anyone on the phone .
negative	to remedy the mistake , the company said they would refund them original shipping cost ($ 0 and some change ).
negative	that was refunded , but no $_00 . 00 .... terrible customer service !
negative	reference .... order # 00 - 0000000 & order # 00 - 0000000
negative	misrepresented them_selves as the actual hotel booking desk , i '_m very displeased with this company billed my credit_card immediately making it impossible for me to change the reservation or modify it in anyway .
negative	i plan on telling anybody that listens about this company and horrible they are .
negative	this is to inform you how extremely frustrated & disappointed i am with the rubbish service you have .
negative	when i phoned requesting for installation of the socket for the router to be moved from the first floor bedroom to the ground_floor lounge your operator did not listen to my instructions .
negative	as a result when an engineer came over on the 00 / 0 / 00 he knew nothing about what to do as he noted that it was a home visit .
negative	i informed him that i wanted the socket to be moved downstairs which he could not do .
negative	he emailed his_boss that it has to be done by bt & would have to wait .
negative	with this home visit i was charged £_00 on my first phone_call for a rubbish service .
negative	due to inconvenience of poor service & faulty internet reception , i phoned on the 00 / 0 / 00 to follow_up & raised my concerned .
negative	the guy assured me that he booked an engineer on the 0 / 0 / 00 to sort it out after i have told_him to listen to my complaint .
negative	today i cancelled some of my appointments & waited for an engineer to come but no one showed_up .
negative	i am extremely angry how unprofessional & uncoordinated your team in receiving phone_calls & arranging the costumer services are .
negative	the conversation i had with 0 operators today did not help either to solve the problem which causes do much hassles on my part as i am not guaranteed a quality & satisfaction of the money i am paying for .
negative	it was not worth pay extrav £_00 for a useless home visit .
negative	i regret accepting the recommendation of my friend to subscribe to your ancient services manned by people who just wanted to talk and not listen to costumer problems .
negative	i would like make formal_complaint about this .
negative	did anyone read my feedback after the home visit of the engineer on the 00 / 0 / 00 ?
negative	you could have arranged someone to deal with it .
negative	i want to withdraw my subscription with your service for it '_s not worth my time money & effort to a third class service .
negative	i received a defective stethoscope .
negative	they would not refund my order because it had my
negative	name engraved on it .
negative	i did not what it engraved but they encouraged me to do so .
negative	saying it we free and i should have it done , not telling_me if something was wrong with what i ordered i could not return it .
negative	so iam stuck with a defective stethoscope , but thank_goodness is has my name on it .
negative	please beware .
negative	i have not received notice that my card has_been sent
negative	he number of products you guys have is great .
negative	the price is really good too .
negative	however i placed an order 0_weeks_ago and still have not gotten my order .
negative	i no the shipping is free but it shouldn_'_t take 0_weeks to get here
negative	it would be nice to have the refresh for each month .
negative	so as a business traveler who does 0 - 0 nights a week in a hotel i cant say this ever happened to me before ... i had a last_minute trip to dc and booked a room at the capitol hill hotel ... by the time i got to dc , went to dinner and got to check - in it was about midnight .
negative	when i got to the hotel i was informed that although i did book a room here they did not have space for me but they had me at another hotel about 00_minutes away .... which was much_lower quality .
negative	full_disclosure they did refund me and pay for me new room and my cab over ( which they did not pay the cabby enough so i had to pay the difference ) .
negative	the hotel they moved me to was dirty , bars on the windows and just smelled_like i don_'_t know what .... in the words of seinfeld doesn_'_t the reservation hold the room for you ???
negative	terrible night ...
negative	i have ordered from contactsforlenses . com 0 times now .
negative	every time apart_from once my contacts have been delivered late ....
negative	they say delivery is usually around 0 - 0 days .... lol ... expect 0 - 0_weeks !
negative	and thats no joke .... it honestly takes them that long , you would think they are delivering on a donkey and cart ...
negative	stop sending me all the annoying adv ertisements .
negative	if i want to but additional services , i will seek them out .
negative	annoy me enough and i will cancel my service with you .
negative	i get too much junk_mail as it is .
negative	stop sending me anything except problem alerts , not ads .
negative	their ad for 0000_malibu radio knob only showed a picture and it was of 0 large knobs and 0 small ones , which i needed .
negative	they ship to me and the box only included 0 large knobs and 0 small one .
negative	i complained about false ad , they quickly change the wording on ad , use the same picture of 0 large and 0 small knobs and only refund the product cost and not the $ 0 . 00 , ( which should only cost $ 0 . 00 per usps rates ) i paid for shipping !!!
negative	they asked for my feedback and never posted / used it on their website ad ??
negative	never again , impossible to talk to anyone at the company , need 0 emails just to find out how to return !
negative	a rip_off company that steals with false_advertising , never again !!!!!
negative	the worst possible internet seller , i should have bought from amazon !!
negative	!
negative	my entire dealing_with partsgeek has_been frustrating from the beginning !
negative	this transaction has cost me out of pocket expenses because partsgeek sent me the wrong item for my 0000_camaro grille .
negative	they sent me a camaro grille for an 0000 thru 0000 , the purchase price for the 0000_camaro grill from partsgeek was $_00 , 00 with shipping_charges of $ 0 . 00 .
negative	this is a total_cost to me of $_00 . 00 overall .
negative	parts_geek sent me a return rma by ups that did not pay for the incorrect item they shipped to me to be ruturned at my expense that cost me $ $_00 . 00 out of my own funds .
negative	this is " unsatisfactory ", and i will file for a refund of my initial purchase price of $_00 . 00 minus the shipping_charges to me of $ 0 . 00 .
negative	i request that i be refunded $_00 . 00 plus (+) $_00 . 00 for a total refund of $_00 . 00 from these " geeks ".
negative	additionally you ask me below to check that " i accept the terms & conditions , and privacy_policy which you did not provide and explanation what those terms and conditions , & privacy_policy are ?
negative	my daughter who is teaching in a foreign_country ordered flowers for my wife on 00 / 00 / 0000 to be delivered on the day before mothers_day ( 00th ).
negative	they never arrived !
negative	nor did they do so on mothers_day as they use royal_mail , despite the fact they alluded they could do so on their site .
negative	when the did arrive today ( monday ), they were in a cardboard_box that looked fairly battered .
negative	however when we opened them the flowers themselves were in a shocking state .
negative	there were flowers with the heads cut_off them , the roses were dead .
negative	but to cap it all these were not the selection of flowers my daughter ordered as they were meant to be orchids !
negative	!
negative	do not use this company for anyone you care about as their customer service is atrocious .
negative	my daughter is going to try for a refund as she could try the dsr act due to the fact this is a british company and she used a british bank card to pay for this disgrace .
negative	however time will tell .
negative	i would invite them to reply to this but is doubtful if they care that much .
negative	stay well clear of these_cowboys !
negative	!
negative	not very happy with the service !
negative	i ordered fog_lights from your on line service for a 0000_mercedes
negative	c000 .
negative	the ones shipped were wrong .
negative	a case was opened and i explained that i needed round not oval .
negative	a link was sent for a reorder stating new order #'_s for round lights .
negative	i ordered them and they also are oval .
negative	i opened another case but all i received back was an_rma #.
negative	so i opened another case on 0 / 0 / 00 today is 0 / 00 / 00 and no response has_been made .
negative	so for a second time i called customer service but after twenty_minutes on hold i had to get back to work and hung_up .
negative	we were charged shipping both_ways twice and we are being charged a 00_percent charge for your bad information . if i don_'_t hear from a rep today i will contact my credit_card company to dispute these charges .
negative	ordered an item off the website .
negative	the next_day , received an_email that it would be delayed a week .
negative	essentially , they sell stuff they don_'_t have in stock , ready for shipment .
negative	after the expected ( delayed ) shipment date , i get another email_saying that there '_s another delay .
negative	the item i ordered wouldn_'_t be shopped for at_least a month after i originally ordered it .
negative	i cancelled my order and informed the better business_bureau of their unscrupulous selling methods .
negative	do yourself a favor and stay_away from this company .
negative	this world should put more sense in whatever does otherwise the lack of common_sense and too much security will transform the human society in robots .
negative	what is the danger for a tin of olive oil sealed as original ?
negative	i can '_t understand these new rules .
negative	i recently_purchased in red leather the english bridal photo_album .
negative	i was quite surprised when it arrived with a purple ribbon and not the red ribbon as shown with the open book on the web_site .
negative	i do see the purple ribbon also but certainly believed that the red ribbon would come with the red leather and not purple .
negative	the web_site should be changed so only the purple ribbon shows or there should be some notation when you order where you have the option to pick the ribbon color you desire if that is an available option .
negative	although the album is beautiful and exactly_what i was looking for every time i see that purple ribbon it will be a reminder that the web_site is not factual and i will feel that i was deceived .

negative	i have not had a recent travelocity experience .
negative	please verify your records .
negative	i tried_calling these_people with no answer i gave them a week .
negative	poor service , but they talk like they care
negative	0 % match is a bit of a scam .... they have a loophole for amazon , ebay and others .... and will accept the price match when you place the order ..... then not tell you that they adjusted the selling price ( and removed the price match ) until after you place your order , about an_hour later via_email .
negative	then ... no easy way to cancel order .
negative	shipped quick but when part doesn_'_t fit , then the night mare begins for two months to get my money back .
negative	this was going to be my first order .
negative	0 cases of cat_food .
negative	0 flavors .

negative	we made a reservation for two adults and two children and after the reservation it said call hotel to request a bed type as it said nowhwere on priceline the type of bed we were getting .
negative	so i called the hotel and they said they cannot change anything that it has to be done through price line .
negative	so we called priceline and it took 00 min before we could even talk to a real_person but even then it was like they werent even real because they were just repeating over and over agin the same thing like they were reading it off a paper .
negative	then they tell us there is nothing they can do and might i say they were very rude !
negative	let it be known we are very unhappy and will never go with priceline ever agin and will tell_everyone we know about our horrible experience !!!

negative	contact with this company was , by_far , the worst experience i have ever_encountered with a reservation service .
negative	i actually cancelled my reservation and rebooked with a another channel at a higher price .
negative	it is all attributable to their terrible customer contact people .
negative	i want to cancel my subricption and cant find out how the 0 - 000 # takes you to i don_'_t know where if that don_'_t work it cant be a good thing
negative	order parts from parts_geek and you may not even get the parts .
negative	i made an order and never got my parts .
negative	when you try to get_ahold of parts_geek , you have to go through a service ticket , that takes 00 to 00_hours to get a response that doesn_'_t even answer your questions .
negative	they basically dodge you .
negative	you will never get_ahold of them by phone , and if you asked them to call you in your service ticket they won_'_t call back .
negative	i have been trying to get_ahold of someone for weeks now !
negative	my truck is still broke_down because they still have my part and money .
negative	so if you order good luck to you , but if you like wasting money then just go to a casino .
negative	i know you wont use this message .
negative	i thought i would save_money on this site ,
negative	but i didn_'_t only get two parts that wouldn_'_t fit my 000i_bmw , they were also broken .
negative	no way i would waste time and money sending them back .
negative	please take all my information and credit_card info out of your system , as i will never use you again .
negative	i will be buying factory parts direct .
negative	they don_'_t cost that much more and i bet i will receive the right parts and not broken .
negative	regards ,
negative	darrel d . page
negative	the prices are competitive , and the parts are delivered in a timely_manner .
negative	however the problem comes if you have a problem , or question about a part .
negative	no one will answer the telephone !
negative	if you fill_out a ticket , it takes days to get a reply , and it is usually some generic , lame remark .
negative	very biased site .
negative	will not let you post bad_reviews .
negative	makes you jump_through all_sorts of hops if you have a bad review .
negative	have tried for two_weeks to post a fair review and they will not let_me post it because i used the word ' fraud ' in the reivew ... what is exactly_what the site was .... don_'_t trust any reviews or ratings from this site !
negative	i '_ve also asked consumer reports to do an review on them to expose them .
negative	i ordered one ( 0 ) part but when i clicked the place order button i was charged for two .
negative	i hit the back button on my browser and my cart clearly showed quantity one .
negative	i immediately emailed customer service at parts_geek less_than 00_minutes after the order frantically trying to get it corrected .
negative	i took screen shots of the the cart that showed quantity one .
negative	a parts_geek customer service person responded_promptly but then basically said i made the mistake and there was no way their system could have made that error and effectively said i was lying , quote " how would you capture the screen after the order was placed you would not be able to back and do so ?".
negative	i was given a return_authorization but now i have to pay for return shipping on an item i never ordered .
negative	i have sent screen shots to prove what happened and have had two subsequent emails asserting that i made the mistake and refusing to reimburse me for return shipping .
negative	i will never order from partsgeek again and i am actively doing everything i can to discourage others from buying from them .
negative	absolutely pathetic customer service and the fact that they do not give their names or any other identifying information in their customer service email responses is absolutely cowardly .
negative	they ' re full of shit !
negative	i got into paypal becausei originally wanted to useit for online gaming as a buffer for any real financial information exchange .
negative	however with no mention on the package there is a true catch - 00 they employ on new users .
negative	so the rub ?
negative	once your " greendot " funds are added to paypal they are subject to different terms and conditions .
negative	paypal then freezes said funds and insures that while in fact your funds are in your account you can '_t access said funds until you provide all of your financial and personal data to paypal .
negative	i don_'_t mind providing some info for tax reasons , etc .
negative	all it takes is a single interception of private_data to ruin your fun and in fact it '_s why i closed my blizzard account and won_'_t return due to serious concern about how blizzard operates their website and account security .
negative	had a laptop in for repair , got an_email_saying it wasnt repairable .
negative	the laptop still overheats far too much .
negative	wouldnt replace it because warranty ended that day .
negative	not impressed .
negative	would not use again they have no phone_number to get hold of them . tring to return this is a pain the the butt .
negative	ordered my product on express delivery which states on confirmation e_mail would arrive in 0 - 0 days .
negative	0 days_later no product when i rang to query was told it was 0 - 0 days after despatch and item had not been despatched .
negative	when i complained as the confirmation e_mail did not state this i spoke to an extremely unhelpful manager who basically said tough .
negative	avoid this company at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	i bought essential whey 00 and it '_s by_far the worst protein i '_ve bought .
negative	it mixes terrible and instantly foams making it undrinkable
negative	sbobet . com won_'_t refund / credit my deposit , even_though i proved my transactions etc .
negative	i recieved a wrong cd - key for fm0000
negative	midway lost my order .
negative	i paid for 0 day shipping and was provided with a ups_tracking_number .
negative	ups does not have the tracking_number on file .
negative	when i called midway to find out the status of my order i spoke with 0 different agents .
negative	each of the agents had a different answer about my order .
negative	the first agent claimed it was processed and waiting in the warehouse .
negative	the second agent claimed it had already shipped out and ups had not updated yet .
negative	the third agent said it shipped but could still be in the warehouse .
negative	ups updates tracking_information every time the package leaves or enters a new location , the update is instant .
negative	they had told me my order was still in the warehouse yet refused to cancel the order and refund my money .
negative	they said i had to receive the package first then send it back only then would they process the cancelation .
negative	i do not want to do_business with this company and they refuse to cancel my order , before it ships .
negative	i was charged and paid for 0 day shipping .
negative	at the end of day 0 it is still sitting in the warehouse .
negative	i was not given the service i paid for , and they are unwilling to do anything to correct the issue .
negative	i will never use this company for purchases again .
negative	we recently installed two hudson_reed thermostatic exposed shower systems .
negative	both systems had defective thermostatic cartridges .
negative	despite the fact that the equipment was less_than one year_old hudson_reed declined to live up to their warranty .
negative	to further exacerbate the situation it took almost 0 months to get the replacement parts ( purchased ).
negative	like the technology but poor execution by an uncaring us distributor .
negative	we have always used book it com and i though that you all would be more understanding with our problem we had .
negative	i peggy labra have used book it .
negative	com for the last four years for all my vacations .
negative	we had book a small vacation , i made the mistake of book it on the wrong weekend .
negative	so we had to pay separate for one night and after staying at that hotel .
negative	we realize it was very dirty and unfriendly .
negative	after_speaking with our agent .
negative	we could not change our resavation to another hotel are are date .
negative	with out loosing one night and two other fees .
negative	we '_ll now you may have staid with that money .
negative	but you all have lost our business and we vacation at_least once a month in all summer in florida .
negative	i '_m very sad to have departed from you all , but that is what you all have forse us to do .
negative	your old and pass customer .
negative	peggy labra &.
negative	david umaña .
negative	i had an air_canada flight from boston to ottawa in late jan . air_canada cancelled the flight long before the departure time .
negative	i called travelocity vip help and said i would like to drive - get me a refund or get me a credit on air_canada and i am going to drive the 0 hours to make my meetings first thing the next_morning .
negative	the travelocity support person was very professional and said he would call air_canada and get it worked out .
negative	he would then send me an_email with the follow_up .
negative	he stated air_canada phone lines were a mess because if the storm .
negative	makes_sense to me and perfect i thought ...
negative	i completed my trip and returned home and there was no email .
negative	i logged_into my account and to my surprise it showed that i was booked on an air_canada flight the next afternoon .....
negative	which of course i missed .
negative	i called immediately and the travelocity person told me there was a note on that trip that i had called but there was no follow_up .
negative	the travelocity representative i talked to never finished the job .
negative	i was charged some $_000 for a flight i never took .
negative	this rep tried to call air_canada while i was on the line to work it out .
negative	after being on hold for 00_minutes the line was cut_off .
negative	i called back - same story - travelocity person tried to call air_canada - on hold for 00_minutes and the line went dead .
negative	this time i said to the person , if you lose me while i am on hold call me back or send me and email about the results .
negative	of course it is a week_later and i have heard_nothing ..... air_canada ranks among the worst airlines for service , nothing new there , but i cannot understand_why travelocity can not follow_up with me .
negative	lesson_learned , in the winter months , book directly with the airlines .
negative	as much as i like using travelocity , they did not come through .
negative	i hope sometime in the next few_months i get some credit for that money .
negative	i bought an ac_compressor and it took way to long for it to arrive .
negative	and nothing came with the compressor .
negative	no label of manufacture , no warrantee , no gaskets , no paperwork ... nothing but the compressor .
negative	after opening the box days_later i discovered it was the wrong compressor .
negative	after 00 emails to them with the same generic response i decided to send it back at my expence of $_00 ... whether it be your fault or there '_s you pay for shipping .
negative	how is that for doing_business .
negative	i '_ll never use them again !
negative	ho
negative	i ordered skylanders spyro starter_pack from coolshop for £_00 . 00 they delivered a total random product of a spiderman web shooter doll ( the one which didn_'_t sell very well conveniently enough !!).
negative	my little boy was absolutely gutted as he ' d waited every day at the door for the postman to turn up with his order for skylanders which he ' d bought with his pocket money .
negative	this company is useless .
negative	i routinely order cases of wine from various companies .
negative	we ordered a case of wine early in january .... as of feb 0 we still have not received it .
negative	they keep telling us it is on the way - one excuse after another .
negative	they evidently don_'_t have the wines that they advertise in stock .
negative	they must have to order them when you order them so it takes_forever to get them .
negative	the tracking_number that they sent us from fedex is invalid so we have no_idea if our wines have even been sent .
negative	they still have not sent us a valid tracking_number .
negative	i will never order from them agian .
negative	i would have given them one no stars but i was not able to .
negative	the product was not shipped after months of waiting .
negative	some guy that could not speak_english named saveen answered the phone and promised the item would be shipped but lied many_times .
negative	he promised to waive shipping after a while and did not do so .
negative	now calls go unanswered .
negative	do yourself a favor and never deal with this website .
negative	i ordered a textbook from bookbyte and became concerned when two_weeks after ordering , i still had not received any notification of it even shipping .
negative	i looked up my order to discover that it had been canceled by bookbyte , but they never provided any notification of this .
negative	they claim their system automatically sends out cancellation notices .
negative	for starters , their system does not work , as you can see previous people have tweeted at them about this exact issue .
negative	additionally , why are they accepting orders they can '_t fulfill in the first place ?
negative	i will never use bookbyte again .
negative	as many of us do i did a search_engine for lowest_price first in my search_criteria .
negative	i have ordered parts for over 00 years so i still compare other_suppliers even_though the price may be higher just to make_sure i am getting everything i need and not just do a knee jerk order based on the 0st low price .
negative	stockwise listed the exact_same product with all of the same components as their higher_priced competitors and even had a picture of the complete front_wheel_hub for our 0000_honda_accord with the hub , bearing , and studs but that is not what they sent !
negative	instead after twice the shipping time quoted i got just the freaking bearings that was priced almost as much a complete hub !
negative	these_guys also do not answer the damn phone !!!
negative	!. they dump you into a mandatory voicemail where you leave your email address and that is how you " talk " to them !!!!
negative	took me over a freakin day with the car on stands with the wrong part after waiting forever for shipping to even get a response from them !
negative	the response was some generic fill in the name email_telling_me to send it back but i would have to pay part of the " free shipping " now !
negative	even_though i showed them my order with the picture of what i paid for and explained what all was missing they still wasted time resending the same damn picture back to me to confirm this was what i ordered !
negative	so no not only do they not answer the phone but they don_'_t read the info in your email to further cost you time !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i absolutely will never order from this crew again .
negative	misrepresented products , zero customer service , over priced actual product and not taking responsibility for their damn mistakes like any reasonable company would .
negative	you have been warned if you order , so beware of what they show you a picture of and just know there is no one to talk to unless you want to spend a couple of days checking your emails dragging your job out even further while they make excuses about how much they sell and how they might " mess up now and then with the millions of items they sell " but do nothing to make it up to you .
negative	what a total disappointment !!!
negative	!
negative	i wrote a review on debtmerica that simply sugessted that people review the managing founder of debtmerica from information readily_available from any search_engine .
negative	the post even stated twice that people should come to their own conclusions .
negative	however , it appears , according to trustpilot '_s posted information for deleting the post , that as soon as debtmerica complained , the post was removed .
negative	sorry , but that appears to be the way a company protection site would act .
negative	i would like to thank trustpilot for allowing me to respond to their removing of my post .
negative	this is an exact copy of my response to them on this matter awaiting their review :
negative	to be fair , lets_see if the post is returned .
negative	reply : could not add a thread so i added it to this one .
negative	thank_you for the opportunity to reply .
negative	i should mention i am a retired marketing executive .
negative	i have an associate that worked in maintenance at my old company .
negative	a nice guy , but not a rhodes scholar , who got himself into financial trouble .
negative	now , before he does " anything big ", he comes and asks me for help .
negative	that is how i ended_up checking out debtmerica .
negative	while i see that you want a person to have purchased a product , the spirit of my post should be the same .
negative	this company is an online company that appears to have been very successful in covering up their history , and are attempting to do so again .
negative	don_'_t you agree that your readers come to your site to be empowered , to help them make informed_decisions , in this case , before they enter into a long_term contract arrangement ?
negative	it is fundamental that people , in this case , your members and readers , should be given all of the factual information available for them to make an informed_decision .
negative	if there are any facts in my post that are not 000_% accurate , then you should remove them .
negative	however , i was very careful to use only facts obtained from official sites : the new_york attorney_general , massachusetts court of appeals , new_york fire fighters association and information directly available from the debtmerica website linking its founder and managing partner jesse stockwell , or his old name jesse e . torres iv .
negative	lastly , twice in my post i told people that they should do their own searches on the founder / managing partner jesse e . stockwell or jesse e . torres iv and then decide for themselves .
negative	again , please consider this was a very accurate post , based on factual information , from official and government websites .
negative	to deny this information to your readers prior to them making a decision , can only be determined to be a ) that you are strongly influenced by the vendor or b ) that you believe your readers should jump into the fire and then , and only then , agree that fire is hot .
negative	do you really believe that your members and readers should sign a contract with debtmerica and then find out what '_s in it ?
negative	thanks again for giving me a chance to reply .

negative	started off good ordered 0000_litres on thursday phoned on monday to find out how long was told it would not be there till the following week and to go find another supplier and would retune my money i found another suppler and payed again
negative	called boiler_juice back and she cancelled my order on wednesday_morning i had two calls one from [_link ] of delivered my heating_oil and then [_link ] to say they had delivered as well so i called them and told them to take it back they said ok then half an_hour later they called back reduced price which iagreed to but that was not the point would be good to have my money back from boiler_juice
negative	the package was fully open with a jetboil flash stove and petzl headtorch inside .
negative	either could have easily fallen out along the way .
negative	perhaps they did several_times .
negative	hello :
negative	i called instrumart to discuss the application in which i would be using two of their controllers and i was told that it would in fact provide the solution i was looking for .
negative	i ordered the devices , and they did not come with any wiring diagrams , so the first one was wired incorrectly by my electrician , the second one had a loose wire in it .
negative	after the electrician did research online , he found the wiring_diagram and also found that the controllers would now work in my application .
negative	i emailed instrumart and did not receive any response .
negative	during a online_chat with them , i was told given a link to their return_policy .
negative	not a satisfied customer ....
negative	received non operating part . called customer service twice .
negative	on hold both calls for approximately 00_minutes before being disconnected .
negative	now they expect me to pay to return their faulty part .
negative	will not use this site again
negative	i ordered on jar of pyrodoxine alpha ketoglutarate , made by douglas laboratories .
negative	but when i reordered two more jars ( 00 tablets each ), the purchase appeared to go through , but a day or two later , i was informed this item was out of stock .
negative	i responded to the notice of cancellation , asking if they could give me any idea of when more of the item would be available , and noone to date has gotten back to me .
negative	also as to this site , " trustpilot ," i was forced to agree to their " terms & conditions " and " privacy_policy " before i could post this review .
negative	no refund of the £_00 return postage_costs
negative	the tailight assembly has wiring different from my car and your website doesn_'_t show the wiring and there '_s no way to speak to a human to identify the correct part so i '_ll just return the part and do_business elsewhere !
negative	laptop got stolen when i locked the doors and windows .
negative	the day receptionist tried to say i didn_'_t lock the door when my german friend was a witness .
negative	not happy with service .
negative	i recently_purchased 00 knockout roses .
negative	they were delivered on time , but were poorly_packaged and as such the plants were sideways or upside_down .
negative	the plants were much smaller than the one guart size shown on the video .
negative	the most disappointing issue for me was the price .
negative	i found several local retailers offering three quart knockout roses for $ 0 and $ 0 less_than the one quart ones i purchased .
negative	buyer know the prices !
negative	!
negative	i recieved an incorrect part and have not been able to get a return_authorization using your internet site .
negative	and cannot get any answer when trying to phone your office .
negative	we booked a flight for a cruise .
negative	the cruise was cancelled ( carnival ).
negative	my sister who had booked directly with delta , called delta and explained what happened .
negative	they waived the $_000 rescheduling fee .
negative	an_hour later i called expedia and explained the situation .
negative	the first rep said they would check with delta , she put me on hold and after five_minutes was somehow on a brand_new call from scratch with an entirely new rep .
negative	explained the situation again and she refused to check with delta , insisting on going with their formal written policy .
negative	i was transferred to her " supervisor " who made me start from scratch saying that i had given the previous rep " no information ."
negative	by the time i finally done , the price for the flight i wanted to switch to had gone up nearly $_000 .
negative	no empathy , canned responses , unwilling to go the extra_mile .
negative	sill had to pay that fee for switching our tickets .
negative	should have booked with a different company .
negative	bought a radiator from partsgeek . com for a 00 infiniti g00 .
negative	waited over a week for shipping .
negative	drove to where the car was located ( 00_minutes away ) simply to find out that the radiator they sent was the wrong_size .
negative	the one they sent me was 0 inches to long and 0 inches too tall .
negative	clearly not the right radiator !
negative	but wait , the box the radiator was packaged in was the correct part number .
negative	attempt to call partsgeek . com to get them to resolve this issue only to find out that they " are experiencing higher_than_expected call_volumes " and i should utilize their online ticketing_system .
negative	ok fine , i submit a ticket with the assurance that the ticket will be answered in 00_hours .
negative	i wait 0 days and still get no response to the ticket until the fourth day .
negative	they tell me that they are issuing a rma_number and that i need to ship the radiator back at my expense !!
negative	this is ridiculous !
negative	i can understand having to pay for return shipping if i ordered the wrong part , or i no_longer need it , but for their mistake ??
negative	highway_robbery !!
negative	there is clearly a problem with this place !
negative	whether it be the manufacturers mix - up , or their gross misconduct in partsgeek . com '_s warehouse , this is not the consumers problem .
negative	no consumer should have to pay for return shipping for a mistake made by the shipper or the manufacturer !
negative	so in a nut_shell , poor / delayed shipping even_though the product showed in stock , absolutely can not get someone on the phone to discuss problem , terrible and drawn_out customer service , and errors on the shippers end that are then passed down to the consumer ??
negative	how can anyone do_business this way ?
negative	stay_away at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	cannot give you a review i never got my part and had to go to auto_parts to buy one . and would like to have my money refunded , also my wife has left you emails no respons ;
negative	i ordered parts from ' geek '.
negative	some parts were never delivered and i '_ve yet to be credited for the inner tie_rod ends that never came .
negative	i have been forced to contest the transaction through visa .
negative	sucks .
negative	after shopping on line for our group badminton purchase we decided to try direct sports .
negative	well placing our order was an adventure .
negative	shopping carts that disappear and when reentered the price increases , empty pages that one must scroll_through before finding the description of the item .
negative	it took hours to research and price the items we wanted .
negative	enquiries regarding specifications and further details went_unanswered or were partially answered .
negative	this scarred of some of the group members and they decided to go to other_retailers .
negative	direct sports has this live price match deal .
negative	this seems to be nothing but a hook to get the customer to place an order .
negative	both of the price match deals on our order were accepted and then denied after we placed our order and paid for it .
negative	we received an_email_requesting more money .
negative	we received an_email after we placed the order and paid for it .
negative	it requested that we telephone them regarding the order .
negative	when i did this i was connected to a recorded_message stating they were closed .
negative	this 00 second message cost 0 . 0 gbp and i learned that the direct sports telephone is a mobile_phone that has the highest mobile_phone rate in the world .
negative	direct sports failed to call back and has not replied to several emails we sent .
negative	00 days_later and 000 gbp the poorer we have no merchandise .
negative	prior to placing an order for badminton gear i attempted to question tennis_nuts about the quality and specifications of the items i wanted to order .
negative	i received partial answers to my questions .
negative	so i took a chance and placed an order and i lost .
negative	i wanted a backup racquet for my carlton vapour trail xcel which i have enjoyed using for about two years .
negative	the advertised specifications were the same as my xcel racquet .
negative	the racquet i received was so different in weight , balance , and flex that i can only conclude it is a " factory mistake " or a counterfeit item .
negative	this is the second such racquet i have received from tennis_nuts .
negative	that was also an expensive carlton racquet .
negative	tennis_nuts failed to reply to my complaints about that one .
negative	we ordered two_pairs of yonex badminton_shoes .
negative	tennis_nuts like most uk retailers warn customers that yonex shoes are not true to size and to order up to a full size larger .
negative	we did this and the width was adequate but we ended_up with a 0 . 0cm void in the toe .
negative	the models we ordered are f0r and 00 ex .
negative	the f0r shoes have little lateral support and the empty space in the toe decreases the stability .
negative	two players told me that they tossed their shoes out after they began falling while playing in them .
negative	we ordered ten cans of yonex 0000 slow shuttles .
negative	we have been using the yonex 0000 medium shuttles since they came out four years_ago .
negative	we wanted to try the slow speed shuttles .
negative	six of the cans we received contained shuttles that weighed the same as the medium shuttles .
negative	two cans weighed more than the medium speed shuttles .
negative	only 00_% of the shuttles we received were in the correct slow speed weight range .
negative	these shuttles appeared to have a genuine anti_- counterfeit halogram sticker .
negative	never will use them again .
negative	agent booked wrong room type , charged more than i agreed than couldnt cancel .
negative	she had to transfer me , another wait .
negative	after that wait i had to wait again and again each call so i could track refund .
negative	they said room was canceled but refund not in system yet had to call back 0 more times .
negative	whole thing took over three hours of my time .
negative	the orignal agent lead me to beleive i was talking directly with that hotel chain , never found out it was a thrid party till after they got my $_000 .
negative	oh ps the rate she quoted was not the rate i paid , of course it was higher .
negative	and no it wasnt due to the taxes ect ...
negative	part didn_'_t fit , can '_t get anyone to respond as to how to deal with it .
negative	rip - off .
negative	tried to order a sofia the first dress , this was one of the only places with reasonable prices that were still in stock .
negative	ordered on the 00th_dec , received mail on the 00th to advise item had been shipped .
negative	yesterday ( 00th ) i receive a mail to advise they ' re out of stock and i '_ve been refunded !
negative	i '_m now left with nowhere to buy another dress and will have one very dissapointed 0 year_old at christmas - this is the only_thing she '_s asked for .
negative	the only positive about this was the lady i spoke to when i called up to complain , she explained the issue about suppliers letting them down , and was very polite .
negative	however the process to confirm an item had been shipped when it was only pre_- ordered ( despite saying ' in stock ' on the website !)
negative	is not only misleading it '_s probably illegal as well .
negative	i '_ll certainly never buy from here again when there are time_constraints to consider .
negative	placed an order via the btd website on 00 - 0 - 00 .
negative	on 00 - 00 - 00 btd emailed me acknowledging my order and stated : " this item has_been ordered and we will ship it as soon as we receive it from the
negative	manufacturer ."
negative	i phoned customer service immediately and left voice_mail upon_receipt of their email message indicating i needed an eta for the merchandise .
negative	no call back or email from btd on 00 - 00 - 00 .
negative	on 00 - 00 - 00 i sent btd an_email again asking for an eta .
negative	no response !
negative	on 00 - 00 - 00 i received email from btd stating that the order had been shipped that same day .
negative	however , because of their failure to respond to me at all , i ordered the same item on 00 - 00 - 00 from a competitor of btd and received it the item on 00 - 00 - 00 .
negative	btd '_s shipment is supposedly en_route .
negative	unless defective , i '_ll keep the merchandise when it arrives .
negative	but it is very highly unlikely i '_ll ever order from btd again .
negative	too bad their service does not match the quality of the merchandise .
negative	the do not have anything in stock take your money and probably will not dispatch goods .
negative	they will take at_least 00 working days to deliver goods .
negative	there site is up and down all the time .
negative	i got lots of blunt and abusive message back from them they do not answer there premium_rate phone_number .
negative	do not purchase from them save your money for a legit company .
negative	this is sent in response to your message back to me .
negative	this is totally incorrect you have got listed on your main page that it is available in 000v and i clicked on that button but it then takes you to 000v .
negative	why_advertise this as it is misleading and causes problems you have already sent me an_email_saying that it will be refunded in full and this was agreed on the phone it is not my fault that the delivery was not made in time .
negative	you should look at better couriers if the are unable to delivered your goods in time .
negative	you need to get better service and actually look at your website and listen to what your customers are saying to you i hope a full_refund shortly as there was no error made on my part regarding delivery and your misleading website .
negative	i did not get to try the product out as on the screen where you select the product it gives you an option of 000v or 000v i selected the 000v i did not notice at the time of this that it only takes you to the 000v option why ?
negative	i done this on the tool stop website and completed with amazon payment .
negative	the delivery did not arrive next_day i can except that as it is the christmas_period and it is very busy .
negative	when i called to say that there was a problem with my order as it was the wrong voltage they said that they do not offer it in 000v i asked why there was an option then .
negative	the checked on amazon as this was the way they ordered it ?
negative	it was not and i kept on having to explain that i ordered it on there website with amazon payment .
negative	this went back and forth they could not see how the website was misleading on the voltage and how the error had occurred .
negative	a full_refund was refused several time by two people .
negative	i was told i can have a refund if i send the parcel back at my expense or i will have to pay a £_00 charge ( very expensive ).
negative	i then had to use the it was not derived next_day so i could get the refund the subject was changed back to the voltage problem after repeating the delivery did not arrive .
negative	i was very reluctantly given a refund .
negative	i did want to got through any of this process at any point .
negative	all i wanted is the correct item i believed i had ordered .
negative	i was made to feel that this was all my fault i will not be using toolstop again very poor service .
negative	i my self am in retail / trade environment and have been for over 00 years .
negative	and am well aware this is not how business should be done .
negative	i politely advise you to amend your customer service skills to retain customer in the future .
negative	i am just in hope now that the refund in processed and goods are collected quickly .
negative	as a seller fees are outrageous , ( roughly 00_% of the sale price plus shipping cost ) then you have to pay shipping as well .
negative	ship international and they claim not received ?
negative	oh well , you lose , the international buyer gets your item for free , on top of that , you paid his shipping_costs !
negative	accidently sell an item over $_000 but didn_'_t include signature upon delivery ?
negative	buyer gets a full_refund !
negative	i wish there was something different that had the reach ebay does , it was a fine system in the beginning but with
negative	income tax ( 00 - 00_%)
negative	sales_tax ( 0 %)
negative	ebay fees ( 00_%)
negative	shipping_costs ( 00_%)
negative	you might as well donate your items , at_least then you get a tax break .
negative	watch out , don_'_t get fooled .
negative	this is a 0nd party company , not working independently for the hotel of your choice .
negative	i was doubled billed and could not cancel until i called and complained .
negative	took about 0 hrs .
negative	after multiple calls and being put on hold .
negative	i believe my calls were being routed to india .
negative	it was hard to under stand every agent .
negative	like many other people that have used lastminute . com and fallen for this little scam ( which is the only way that it can be described !)
negative	i was very disappointed to discover that i could have bagged a better deal if i had gone direct to the hotels own website rather_than find something through these rip_off merchants !
negative	lastminute . com charge you for the room only and do not include breakfast in the price .
negative	i later discovered that if i had gone to the hotels own website i could have paid £ 0 extra ( so no great saving of upto 00_%_off to be had there either as lastminute . com declare on their website !)
negative	and had breakfast for two people included in the price of the room .
negative	as it transpires breakfast at this particular hotel is an_additional £_00 / head .
negative	most unhelpful customer service women spoke to who basically took great pleasure in explaining that refunds can not be given because of terms and conditions ... lastminute . com has lost its way , what started off as a great website has now just turned into a total bunch of con_artists .... take my advice and the advice of others on here and avoid avoid avoid , you would be wiser to find a hotel on moneysupermarket . co . uk or expedia and then contact the hotel direct for there prices and cut out the rip of middle men at lastminute . com .
negative	will start you off at a reasonable rate and skyrocket that rate once you begin collecting reviews .
negative	want to leave - say goodbye to all your positive_reviews and no chance to respond .
negative	when i ordered a water neck for my 000 ford engine , you can imagine my surprise when i opened the package to fined one for a 000 - 000 engine !!
negative	bad enough the shipping cost was as much as the part , but you don_'_t offer a refund even if it '_s your error !!
negative	if i were to pay to have the 00 dollar part sent back , it wouldn_'_t make_sense you think ?
negative	if i did so and requested the right part be sent , whose to say it wouldn_'_t happen again ?
negative	i think you should rethink your return_policy !!!!
negative	maybe you should look at the way other company '_s do_business ! one that comes to mind is summit where they refund with no shipping cost to there customer '_s . for me tho , i will just have another item for a swap meet !!
negative	color me unsatisfied !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i found the service very average , not as good as others i have used ,
negative	to cap it off i then found that my ipod had been stolen , i phoned and told them , and then emails customer_services that was 0 days ago still heard_nothing , i have reported the theft to the police .
negative	would never ever use or recommend them to be used
negative	went in the store sunday 00sep around 00 . 00 lengthy queues at checkouts went one to be told in a rude manner i am closed dumped shopping and found the duty manager he couldn_'_t have cared less not the first time this ahs happened in this store
negative	overall the staff in there aren_'_t particulary pleasant
negative	i suggest if aldi do any courses on customer service the wednesfield store gets an invite
negative	i purchased a part online .
negative	thought it was strange that i never received a confirmation_email .
negative	it has since been over 0_weeks and i have now sent three on the customer service tickets and have sent two faxes .
negative	the customer service is non_- existent .
negative	there is no phone_number or email address .
negative	you only have a fax_number and some kind of " ticket " to submit on the website , neither of which they respond to .
negative	my order was apparently received , because i was sent this survey .
negative	still no response whatsoever , i would go elsewhere looking for parts in the future .
negative	we are selling on ebay almost 0 years and had a lot of scam transactions with ebay buyers and lost around $ 0000 in 0000 .
negative	neither ebay nor paypal didn_'_t protect us as they state on the ad .
negative	every time we called ebay or paypal it felt_like we talked with the robots .
negative	all they can do is to follow ebay or paypal guidelines .
negative	both companies generate billions of dollars in net income ( check it out at wikipedia . com )
negative	last_year we paid $ 00000 in ebay and $ 0000 in paypal fees .
negative	it is ridiculous to pay $ 00000 in fees for companies that don_'_t provide real service .
negative	now we are moving to square and ebid .

negative	i refuse to use partsgeek ever again .
negative	i bought some oil_filters from them , they were sent to the wrong_address in a different state and they refused to do anything about it except for tell me , what i already knew , that the parts were sent to the wrong state .
negative	they didn_'_t offer a refund or to send new filters or help me out in the slightest , they took my money and bent me over .
negative	thanks parts_geek for absolutely nothing .
negative	i order a specific part for my vehicle .
negative	and instead im given another part for some other vehicle .
negative	i have no use for what so ever .
negative	this is the 0nd and last time .
negative	and to top it all off i have to pay $_00 . 00 just to ship it back .
negative	money out of my pocket for the company '_s mistake .
negative	you are supposed to be a cheaper and better way to get auto_parts .
negative	this im not seeing one bit of .
negative	you have one job and you can '_t do that right ?
negative	so then why is it you are even running your company .
negative	waste of time , waste of money .
negative	partsgeek sucks !!!
negative	i ordered a single pair of fenders for my nissan_pathfinder and through a ordering glitch these rotten bastards decided that i should have two_pairs instead of one !!
negative	i '_ve tried to call them with my phone_number so this could be solved , but yet they have been unwilling to straighten this mess out . i '_ve called my credit_card company to dispute the double charge and yet they still refuse to make this oversight right .
negative	do yourself a great big favor and do not buy anything from this place there customer service truly sucks !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i should have looked up the reviews before ordering from this site .
negative	what a mistake !
negative	there is no customer service .
negative	if you or them make a mistake , well it '_s just to bad .
negative	you cannot call and change your order .
negative	you will have to pay for shipping return and restocking_fee of 00 %.
negative	just losing money with these_people .
negative	do not order from them !
negative	f *** you !
negative	parts_geek .
negative	what a joke you guys are !
negative	if i could i would give them 0_stars .
negative	sent a generic part , buy somewhere_else ...!
negative	failed to meet delivery within 0 working days , and had to chase before despatching - very disappointed in service .
negative	after booking my appointment on the web i had to go through four changes of date and time before my tyres were changed .
negative	evidently the central booking office hae no_idea what the local fitting_centres are doing .
negative	talking to the very decent bloke that eventually did the work this is a regular feature .
negative	left_hand doesn_'_t talk to right hand .
negative	i emailed kwikfit to see what the problem was but they didn_'_t even bother to reply .
negative	so ... ats euromaster it is then !!
negative	!
negative	no one answered the phone
negative	prev used and found very good so i was disappointed this time .
negative	drop_off was fine but on pick_up there was confusion about where my car was to be collected from .
negative	the staff_member was rude to the point of being aggressive and did not seem in the slightest bit interested in helping .
negative	its a shame and i won_'_t be using this provider again .
negative	in the past i have dealt_with partsgeek and had no problem .
negative	this time when i ordered parts , the shipping stated 0 - 0 business days .
negative	the shipment took every bit of 0 business days and sat in the originating shipping location for three of those days .
negative	when i had questions about parts ordered , i discovered there is no customer service phone_number , only email .
negative	when a customer service inquiry was made , it took hours and hours to hear back and my question was not answered till about the fourth time i asked the question .
negative	my shipment is due to be in tomorrow and i will have to wait to see if the part is correct since i never got a definitive answer from customer service .
negative	i will think_twice about doing_business with a company that doesn_'_t have an 000 customer service line in the future .
negative	parts have still not arrived waiting more than 00 days
negative	delivery was guaranteed next_day delivery and came 0 days_later , the main_reason i chose this website was to take_advantage of the " gauranteed next_day delivery " and it took 0 days to arrive !
negative	emailed the sales and no help was given except for this has to be expected , which shouldn_'_t be if they ' re claiming " gauanteed next_day " very disappointed seeing as needed my order the next_day !
negative	i had an error with my prescription .
negative	i sent multiple emails to my contact and called .
negative	they asked me to take it to my eye_doctor to get corrected and that it must have been my error .
negative	i ordered from warby parker and sportrx isig the same prescription and both of those companies delivered perfect lenses .
negative	disappointed and now have 000 dollar glasses that are useless .
negative	still trying to work it out ...
negative	six times i set_up a shipment ... six times i get told the driver came and no one was there .
negative	this is a business with a active mail office .
negative	i give three different contact numbers and exact location to come to pick_up the package .
negative	i wait and wait .
negative	no calls ... no show .
negative	i work 0 hrs a day and then have to wait extra time .
negative	i don_'_t get paid_extra for staying and waiting for people that don_'_t want to do their job .
negative	i tried to do a gift_card with our company logo .
negative	purchase was denied by giftcards . com
negative	i now understand that is a visa and mastercard policy .
negative	the problem is it took several phone_calls and conversations with your employees to figure_out the answer .
negative	the cooperate portion of your company called me as they can do company logos .
negative	but , the gift_cards are only good for 0 - 00 months .
negative	that is too short of a time frame in our opinion .
negative	so , unfortunately i will be purchasing about $_00 , 000 worth of gift_card at our local wal_- greens instead of giftcard . com .
negative	no he recibido ningún email de confirmación sobre la_compra realizada através de budgetair . es .
negative	estoy_muy preocupado por ello , y necesito confirmación urgente de dicho perdido

negative	don_'_t buy from parts_geek ive been waitin for my parts too_long i will call the credit_card to cancel
negative	i ordered a door_handle part for my son '_s driver '_s side door , when it finally got here ( over a week ) it was for the back door .
negative	in the mean time he has no handle and i needed to get one fast now .
negative	i got on line and got one from another company and they don_'_t charge for shipping and handlling .
negative	i ordered ( order id : 000000000 ) foods for my birds 0 days ago and they sent shipment email next_day .
negative	today there is still no movement when i check the tracking_number .
negative	i called them and they said they don_'_t have this food in stock .
negative	so basically they mark orders as shipped even_though they don_'_t actually ship .
negative	when i asked them how to fix this problem , they didn_'_t even apologize properly .
negative	stay_away from them , at all cost .
negative	now i have to order this food from somewhere_else and i have to pick overnight shipping and pay for it .
negative	i have proof of purchase !
negative	good job !
negative	the merger of airlines made this trip very frustrating .
negative	waiting in line for an_hour at one airline , only to be told that i had to go and check in with another airline instead .
negative	the only_thing worse was the tsa .
negative	never again will i order parts from partsgeek .
negative	i receive wrong parts !
negative	no customer service .
negative	..
negative	waited for 0 days after estimated delivery date cited in shipment confirmation e_-_mail .
negative	now in the process of cancelling the order .
negative	hopefully i can get that done , without a lot of delay and false_promises .
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	i bought tickets for a multi city trip .
negative	between the time i purchased the tickets and my travel one of the airline mergers started up .
negative	according to the airline affected one of the ticket legs was incorrect .
negative	i spent about 0 hours on the phone with the airline and travelocity trying to fix it and check in .
negative	the travelocity staff was cordial but totally ineffective .
negative	foreign based service staff is cheap but definitely second tier .
negative	my advice is buy direct with the airline after making your search .
negative	awfull service for repeat_customers !
negative	can never speak to anyone by phone !
negative	treated like a number
negative	sad corporate treatment
negative	you asked my oinion and im giving it !
negative	world pac is even better !
negative	businesses like myself recieve
negative	better treatment from their inlaws
negative	than you folks .

negative	i am not happy with the way priceline handled my request .
negative	their rating_system for hotels leaves much to be desired .
negative	the cavelier inn in charlottesville va is an_absolute dump and yet on priceline it is listed as a 0 . 0_star .
negative	when i asked for a refund of the difference_between a 0 . 0_star and a dump i was told that " they empathize " but can '_t do anything for me other than a 00 . 00 coupon_code that turned_out to be a 0 . 00 coupon_code .
negative	seriously you can '_t even tell me the correct coupon_code that you are trying to placate me with ?
negative	i tried to purchase a part which they showed on their website , only to be informed that they didn_'_t have it and i would get a full_refund .
negative	which i did , but why should i have to go through the entire check out process just to waste my time ?
negative	ordered sparker they said would fit my cooker had only 0 sockets my cooker has 0 sockets the next part i ordered they sent the wrong part
negative	i have just returned from cyprus .
negative	i booked villa efrosini , coral bay , it was great no_problems and would recommend it .
negative	my complaint is this : when i booked the villa , can '_t remember how much , lets say £_000 .
negative	that was for me and my wife .
negative	however , some friends were joining us the second week .
negative	so i entered 0 people for the villa , same again £_000 came up .
negative	basically we were paying for a 0 bedroom villa that sleeps eight .
negative	my wife and i decided to get the flights too so nowhere to enter 0 flying 0 not .
negative	so i just entered me and my wife , it didn_'_t matter , i was paying for an eight person villa .
negative	or so i thought , after_reading the small_print it mentions if someone_else joins later they want £_00 more each person admin_fee .
negative	i tried to explain to them it makes no difference to the price no matter_how many go , they were adament it would have gone up .
negative	i have just gone on their site , picked a villa and put 0 guests , £_000 .
negative	i then put in 0 guests , £_000 . they had me over for £_00 .
negative	be_careful .
negative	we also spoke to the owner , very nice lady , who said it did not matter_how many guests were there , she paid the cleaners to look after 0 people .
negative	( she also was confused why she has not been paid any of the £_00 if that '_s what villa_plus were getting away with .)
negative	this kind of petty cheating money out of me has left a sour_taste and i '_m not sure i '_ll use them again .
negative	having read the reading on my oil tank the day before my oil delivery i made it just under 000_litres ( 000_litres to be generous ) after delivery of my 000 litre order my tank measured 000_litres .
negative	000 - 000 = 000_litres about 000_litres short of my order .
negative	normally the delivery slip shows the start and finish reading from the delivery tank but not with this company .
negative	i was still charged for 000_litres .
negative	quite simply i will vote with my feet and take my future orders else where !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	the parts are great , the customer service is not !
negative	they told me via_email that if i left feedback , that they would give me a coupon_code for $_00 . 00 off my next purchase .
negative	no where in the email is there any * that indicates terms on what that means .
negative	i fill_out a review , and was honest , they have the best prices that i found on the web , then received an_email coupon_code for $ 0 . 00 off my next purchase of $_000 . 00 or more !!!
negative	umm .
negative	that is not $_00 . 00 as_advertised , and now adding stipulations to the code .
negative	not cool !
negative	so i contacted them via support_ticket .
negative	my responce was basically , " that code is expired , we do not have any 00 . 00 codes , ..." and tough crap .
negative	( the jist of the conversation .)
negative	am i being unreasonable to expect a company that contacts me , to follow through with what they promise to do ?
negative	may be i am just old fashion .
negative	but if i tell my customers something , then they expect me to do what i say .
negative	and here is my real concern ...
negative	if for some reason i get shipped a defective_part , or god_forbid they make a mistake on my order , will they do the right thing ?
negative	my guess is probably not !
negative	i am extremely disappointed with the in store service , as my employee was not of uk decent the staff at the nuneaton a car care centre were nothing but underhanded and tricked him into turning in 0 of the tyres which still had 0mm of tread on them on the basis that they were " not legal ".
negative	had it not been for my supervisor spotting this he never would have returned to retrieve them .
negative	extremely annoyed with these deceitful attempts to con us out of two tyres .... is this what this world is coming to !
negative	avoid nuneaton a car care centre !
negative	my experience with parts_geek had been impossible to handle after the order .
negative	the part was delivered damaged .
negative	their packaging was very poor .
negative	i have not been able to call anyone at parts_geek .
negative	each of my five calls were dropped after several minutes of waiting .
negative	each of my emails got only an_automated_response and still no answer to how to return the damaged part or my request to call me .
negative	the protector was delivered damaged .
negative	i have been trying to contact you for several days with no response either by phone or email .
negative	so , what do i think about the product ?
negative	not usable and your customer service is about the worse i '_ve had in a very long time .
negative	i hate to say never but , i hope i never have to use you again .
negative	i am stuck with a product i can '_t use .
negative	that '_s what i think about the product and your customer service .
negative	i put in the year , make and model of my car .
negative	ordered brake_pads and they sent me the wrong_size .
negative	i contacted them and they authorized a return but i had to ship it back myself and pay for that .
negative	i emailed them asking for a shipping refund on my next order so i could get my money back for it .
negative	well i ordered a tail_light since i got the brake_pads from another site at this point .
negative	they denied giving me a shipping refund even_though the the price of shipping the brake_pad is the same as shipping the tail_light .
negative	why make the customer pay for your mistake ?
negative	you could have issued a call_tag so ups picks it back up and no cost to me .
negative	order cancelled for a made up reason , loads of spam received afterwards ( didn_'_t sign for this ).
negative	ordered a trunk lock for dodge_neon , sent me the incorrect lock
negative	these_guys think they are still a catalog and not a website .
negative	times have changed , and these_guys are being left in the dust
negative	i received a letter from dx advising they had attempted a delivery at my address .
negative	however , they did not say on which date and nor did they leave a calling card .
negative	to be honest i thought it a scam to make me ring a premium number .
negative	expecting the delivery of some shopping vouchers i rearranged delivery visit their web_page and had my wife babysit the front_door all day , but alas again no attempted delivery and no details on the website as to what the issue is .
negative	you can ’ t phone them either and you can ’ t go to their depot to pick_up the item either .
negative	they don ’ t publish their depot addresses , nor do they have a person available on a customer service number , just an_automated_system which tries to arrange yet another delivery date .
negative	somehow you know that it will be just another day lost waiting at the front_door and no reason given for non_- delivery .
negative	tracking no .
negative	0000000000
negative	ill never use this arm of the post_office .
negative	fees were twice that or parcelhero and every - time i get a package from the us these_clowns want a massive cut to release from them .
negative	they can g - g - f !
negative	i placed an order just to find out that after i placed it , it can not be cancelled , not before .
negative	i tried to cancel my order the next when they had not even started processing and they said i should '_ve read faq that i could '_t cancel any orders after_placing them .
negative	i told them than they seem to be more operations geared than customer geared .
negative	they made around $_00 from me + shipping for my mistake .
negative	that will be all the business they will get from me .
negative	i guess they prefer one - time suckers and repeat clients .
negative	there are many reviews for squaretrade , all very positive .
negative	unfortunately the vast_majority appear to be from people who have set_up their warranty quickly & easily online and haven_'_t had to deal with squaretrade '_s customer service or make a claim .
negative	there are multiple online_retailers selling squaretrade_warranties , amazon being one of the main ones .
negative	you can go to amazon and purchase a squaretrade_warranty considerably_cheaper then on the squaretrade website .
negative	the amazon listings are created and maintained by squaretrade and the warranty comes from them directly .
negative	i purchased a new squaretrade_warranty from amazon having meticulously read the terms and conditions to ensure my new device was fully covered .
negative	everything matched up with what i wanted and i was happy with the terms and conditions , especially the fact that the device didn_'_t have to come from amazon ( which it didn_'_t , i ' d bought it from another reputable retailer 0 days prior ).
negative	this was made especially clear by the bullet point statement " available for items purchased on or outside of amazon ".
negative	shortly_after setting_up my warranty i noticed on the ' my warranties ' page that the insured device was described as having been purchased from amazon .
negative	i contacted customer_services to ask if this could be changed to where i actually bought the device from as i didn_'_t want it to affect any possible claims .
negative	some hours_later i received a phone_call from a squaretrade representative informing_me that not only did my warranty not cover the type of device i ' d purchased but it also didn_'_t cover items that weren_'_t purchased directly from amazon .
negative	i calmly confronted the representative about this new information and explained that i ' d read the key facts document , the t & c '_s document and the amazon listing thoroughly ( as i '_m generally cautious when it comes to insurance ) and not only did such information not exist but the site explains that the device does not need to be bought from amazon .
negative	the now bewildered support rep kept repeating ( in between long pauses ) ' i '_ll have to take this up with head office '.
negative	at this point i requested to speak to a manager .
negative	i was assured that a manager would ring me back shortly .... no phone_call .
negative	in the meanwhile i forwarded an_email with images detailing the misinformation on the website ..... still no phone_call .
negative	after several hours i rang squaretrade and requested to speak to a manager again as the call i ' d been promised hadn_'_t happened .
negative	i explained that due to pending travel i would like to know that my warranty / accidental_damage is in place ......
negative	excuses followed by " a manager will_definitely contact you in the next hour " ..... still no phone_call .
negative	i '_ve since contacted amazon and reported the issue .
negative	amazon have contacted_squaretrade requesting that they amend any incorrect information on their listing and work towards resolving the issue .
negative	i '_ve still had no phone_call .
negative	the alarming thing is , when you look at the glowing_reviews on amazon for squaretrade please take a moment to actually read them .
negative	a massive percentage of them are from customers who '_ve purchased their amazon listed squaretrade_warranty for similar devices , from different retailers and are happy with their purchase but have never claimed or spoke to squaretrade .
negative	if the information squaretrade have given me is true then these_people '_s products are not covered , at all !
negative	this creates an interesting stalemate .
negative	if the information presented is incorrect will squaretrade amend / update it ?
negative	if so , are they going to contact the hundreds of people giving them glowing_reviews on amazon and tell them that their products are not covered ?
negative	are they going to refund them ?
negative	maybe they '_ll honour the warranties although i doubt this as they ' re arguing mine when what i '_ve paid for is in black and white and i '_m not even making a claim .
negative	i '_m not entirely sure how any of this has come about but i '_m pretty sure it '_s illegal .
negative	you can '_t base a policy around what your policy documentation doesn_'_t say whilst simultaneously making excuses in an attempt convince customers that they ' re wrong about what the retail site does say .
negative	if you can trust a company who can create new terms and conditions on the fly that aren_'_t mentioned in any of their documentation and blatantly dispute features of your product which are written in plain_english on re - seller websites , then enjoy your warranty and good luck if you ever have to use it .
negative	otherwise i ' d recommend taking out an extended_warranty from the manufacturer of your product or checking the features of your home insurance / credit_cards as these can sometimes cover electrical products etc .
negative	had i not contacted_squaretrade to query a tiny error on the policy i would have been paying for a warranty that would never have covered my device and only found out when it was too_late .
negative	i '_ll be following this up with trading_standards as i believe what they are doing ( whether intentional or not ) is illegal .
negative	there are many reviews for squaretrade , all very positive .
negative	unfortunately the vast_majority appear to be from people who have set_up their warranty quickly & easily online and haven_'_t had to deal with squaretrade '_s customer service or make a claim .

negative	you can go to amazon and purchase a squaretrade_warranty considerably_cheaper then on the squaretrade website .
negative	the amazon listings are created and maintained by squaretrade and the warranty comes from them directly .
negative	i purchased a new squaretrade_warranty from amazon having meticulously read the terms and conditions to ensure my new device was fully covered .
negative	everything matched up with what i wanted and i was happy with the terms and conditions , especially the fact that the device didn_'_t have to come from amazon ( which it didn_'_t , i ' d bought it from another reputable retailer 0 days prior ).
negative	this was made especially clear by the bullet point statement " available for items purchased on or outside of amazon ".
negative	shortly_after setting_up my warranty i noticed on the ' my warranties ' page that the insured device was described as having been purchased from amazon .
negative	i contacted customer_services to ask if this could be changed to where i actually bought the device from as i didn_'_t want it to affect any possible claims .
negative	some hours_later i received a phone_call from a squaretrade representative informing_me that not only did my warranty not cover the type of device i ' d purchased but it also didn_'_t cover items that weren_'_t purchased directly from amazon .
negative	i calmly confronted the representative about this new information and explained that i ' d read the key facts document , the t & c '_s document and the amazon listing thoroughly ( as i '_m generally cautious when it comes to insurance ) and not only did such information not exist but the site explains that the device does not need to be bought from amazon .
negative	the now bewildered support rep kept repeating ( in between long pauses ) ' i '_ll have to take this up with head office '.
negative	at this point i requested to speak to a manager .
negative	i was assured that a manager would ring me back shortly .... no phone_call .
negative	in the meanwhile i forwarded an_email with images detailing the misinformation on the website ..... still no phone_call .
negative	after several hours i rang squaretrade and requested to speak to a manager again as the call i ' d been promised hadn_'_t happened .
negative	i explained that due to pending travel i would like to know that my warranty / accidental_damage is in place ......
negative	excuses followed by " a manager will_definitely contact you in the next hour " ..... still no phone_call .
negative	i '_ve since contacted amazon and reported the issue .
negative	amazon have contacted_squaretrade requesting that they amend any incorrect information on their listing and work towards resolving the issue .
negative	i '_ve still had no phone_call .
negative	the alarming thing is , when you look at the glowing_reviews on amazon for squaretrade please take a moment to actually read them .
negative	a massive percentage of them are from customers who '_ve purchased their amazon listed squaretrade_warranty for similar devices , from different retailers and are happy with their purchase but have never claimed or spoke to squaretrade .
negative	if the information squaretrade have given me is true then these_people '_s products are not covered , at all !
negative	this creates an interesting stalemate .
negative	if the information presented is incorrect will squaretrade amend / update it ?
negative	if so , are they going to contact the hundreds of people giving them glowing_reviews on amazon and tell them that their products are not covered ?
negative	are they going to refund them ?
negative	maybe they '_ll honour the warranties although i doubt this as they ' re arguing mine when what i '_ve paid for is in black and white and i '_m not even making a claim .
negative	i '_m not entirely sure how any of this has come about but i '_m pretty sure it '_s illegal .
negative	you can '_t base a policy around what your policy documentation doesn_'_t say whilst simultaneously making excuses in an attempt convince customers that they ' re wrong about what the retail site does say .
negative	if you can trust a company who can create new terms and conditions on the fly that aren_'_t mentioned in any of their documentation and blatantly dispute features of your product which are written in plain_english on re - seller websites , then enjoy your warranty and good luck if you ever have to use it .
negative	otherwise i ' d recommend taking out an extended_warranty from the manufacturer of your product or checking the features of your home insurance / credit_cards as these can sometimes cover electrical products etc .
negative	had i not contacted_squaretrade to query a tiny error on the policy i would have been paying for a warranty that would never have covered my device and only found out when it was too_late .
negative	i '_ll be following this up with trading_standards as i believe what they are doing ( whether intentional or not ) is illegal .
negative	was disappointed at the cheap feel to wiring and lights .
negative	i could of got professional rubberised cable and 00 mm bulbs for an extra £_00 for elsewhere .
negative	lights work but for how long due to the thin speaker cable wiring .
negative	don_'_t understand part '_s geek , ordered a oil_pan and gasket , got oil_pan next_day with no oil_pan gasket , so went to advance_auto part '_s and got one , needed it bad , contacted part '_s geek .
negative	said couldn_'_t cancel oil_pan gasket , got one from geek three day '_s later .
negative	the man had to have his car , so what was i suppose to do .
negative	from now on , i will order from autopart '_s warehouse
negative	i received a part that did not work .
negative	it cost $_00 .
negative	it cost me $_00 to return a defective_part .
negative	i ordered a heater part from them , we live in nj and it was 00 - 00_degrees high during the days , so i paid_extra for 0nd day shipping .
negative	ups lost the part that day - so they estimated it would take a week to find it and ship it .
negative	i called the rep and asked them to just ship another part overnight - i was told that it was too costly to do that , and since the error was on ups it was not their problem .
negative	ups shipped the part to the northwest us somewhere , and it would take a week to get it back and ship to me .
negative	i again called the rep and explained the situation - no heat for a week if i had to wait for ups to get their act_together , again was told its not their fault so not their problem .
negative	while i do get it was not their fault , ups doesn_'_t have heater parts , they do .
negative	all they had to do was ship another one overnight and deal with the cost side of it with their ups account .
negative	talked to several managers and they all said the same thing , it '_s too expensive to ship overnight if they have to pay the cost , so i would have to wait for the part from ups .
negative	that was 0_weeks_ago - still no part and i had to go buy it from another company .
negative	i would never recommend them to anyone .
negative	update - right after writing this review i got an_email from <_name removed_> from ecomfort ... not emailing to apologize for the problems i had with their company , or to see if i had heat , but to complain that i was not accurate enough if describing my problem - what great customer service this company has !!
negative	!
negative	so , i ordered the part from them monday 00 / 00 / 00 with 0 day air shipping .
negative	on 00 / 00 / 00 , the day i was supposed to get the part , ups told me they lost is and i would not get it until at_least 00 / 00 / 00 a full week after i ordered it .
negative	i then called multiple_times and was told by ecomfort that they did not think it prudent to overnight a $_00 part as the shipper lost it , not them , as the shipping was more than the part .
negative	the fact that i would have no heat for a week , in nj in the winter , did not matter to them , as it just was not cost_effective to correct a mistake in their supply_chain .
negative	they chose the shipper , not me .
negative	oh , and they did offer to refund the shipping - what a joke , i would have just disputed that charge anyway because they did not get it to me in 0 days , so that offer was disingenuous at best , it cost them nothing to offer what they were going to get refunded from their shipper anyway .
negative	still have yet to get the part from them , though now they say it was left at my front_door .
negative	i hope this clarifies the matter for everyone , as apparently the exact details of how they screw up are more important than the clients .
negative	the wrong part was sent and the company policies are a nightmare .
negative	i ordered 0 struts for my mini_cooper .
negative	only 0 arrived as the package was not sealed .
negative	i filed a claim with ups and notified you that i had filed a claim .
negative	ups said they did not need to see the package etc .
negative	all i wanted was you to send me the missing strut .
negative	it has now been almost a month .
negative	i cannot contact you on the phone .
negative	i am put on hold and then notified to contact you via_e_-_mail .
negative	i am getting mixed messages about reordering the part and processing a refund , neither of which has happened .
negative	if you want to give me a refund , fine , then i will order another , but i shouldn_'_t have to pay shipping again .
negative	i am really disgusted with the lack of customer service on this issue .
negative	i can '_t see how you can stay in business if you treat everyone who has a problem this way .
negative	if this is not resolved by the early part of next week , i am going to dispute the charge on my credit_card .
negative	i have had it !
negative	the delivery arrived with broken box 0 nuts were missing and the plastic barrow tray had deep scatches all over it .
negative	very disappointing
negative	ordered cat liter , account was charged , 00 days_later , an_email - not delievering . account credited supposedly . not good service to me .
negative	no_problems booking a room , although an extra $ 0 charge from a travel_agent was put on our credit_card for some apparent_reason ( we did not use a travel_agent , we went directly through comfort_inn '_s website ).
negative	then we had to cancel it , and no one could find our reservation to cancel it .... but they sure found it to charge it to our credit_card !
negative	we never do this online again !
negative	failed muzo haunt .
negative	null points
negative	i purchased la muscle products from here .
negative	i was very upset to find the creatine box was massive with only half the tub filled with creatine .. serious false_advertising ... also these_guys had a sale on la products the very next_day after i had purchased them and never had the decency to tell me when i purchased over the phone that they intended on having a sale on those very products the next_day if i wanted to wait .. i felt screwed ... very pissed with this , i wont be ordering from them again .
negative	shipping too high and will not use your company in the future .
negative	it is ridiculous to not combine shipping into one price .
negative	we spent $_000 on our order and since had to ship from three warehouses .
negative	one part was $ 0 . 00 and the shipping was $ 0 . 00
negative	retrain , retrain , retrain ,
negative	i put on an order and sadly on there website it says it would fit my car .
negative	when i got the item its for an_older_model .
negative	i should be placing no start on my review .
negative	they have a internet based business .
negative	but i never got an_email_telling_me how come they send me the wrong part .
negative	i '_m now sending it back to them .
negative	its just a pain .
negative	the hotel was great .
negative	everything you hope for and more , but when making the reservation make_sure you are connected to the correct people .
negative	i ask if i was connected to the hotel_directly and the agent told me yes .
negative	( she lied ...) i booked the reservation with the intention of booking a whirlpool room , the agent told me they were sold out .
negative	when i arrived at the hotel , i found out that i was not connected to the hotel , that i made my reservation through a third_party .
negative	because the reservation was made thru a third_party i could not upgrade to the room i originally asked for even_though they had plenty available .
negative	got a great price on a floor mat for my camry , ordered it online on a saturday but quickly realized i picked the wrong color .... ughh .
negative	sent an_email an_hour after the order .... ( since they do not use phones apparently ) to correct this ... got a response on monday saying to " refuse the shipment or contact customer service for a rma ".
negative	i '_m thinking no way the mat was shipped , you can '_t correct the error ?
negative	when i asked this on a reply , i got another email with a cut and paste of the same quote above .... is this company done on a computer ???
negative	nothing personal at all with this experience .
negative	seems they were quick to process my order , but it '_s been 0 days and still no refund or contact that they '_ve received the return shipment .
negative	my recommendation is go elsewhere .
negative	i was searching for hotels for my trip to asia and having checked on numerous websites including agoda , and before_finalizing on my hotel choice and who to book with , agoda started pushing hotel ads to browsing activity with very , very misleading hotel rates for the various hotels i had previously considered .
negative	agoda '_s quoted rate for those hotels often flashed " from $_00 " for a hotel when i clicked on it for my dates , showed no less_than $_000 a night for the cheapest room .
negative	likewise , for other hotels when the " from rate " was all bogus .
negative	i would never even attempt to check agoda hotel reservation website ever again , not when there are dozens more reputable ones online .
negative	i received a pair of ray_bans with prescription_lenses but one lens was proud of the external frame .
negative	i emailed them and received the following response
negative	" this right lens is slightly thicker than the left , but also orientation of the cylinder aspect of your prescription affects the edge thickness .
negative	but your welcome to return these to us for inspection if you are unhappy with this "
negative	my view is that if you advertise something you should be able to deliver and if you know you will deliver something not as_advertised then that should be stated .
negative	not happy especially when paid £_000 for a apir of sunglasses with one lens haging out .
negative	put order in , paid for it , then they canceled the order .
negative	no_explanation , just canceled it .
negative	said would return my money and no penalty .
negative	what a lie .
negative	what i paid and what i received back are 0 different amounts .
negative	i have always enjoyed chicago steaks .
negative	i truly_appreciate good steaks .
negative	our family raised registered aberdeen angus cattle in east texas .
negative	my father served on the national angus board ... so know goodarblized meat .
negative	the sirloin steaks were a mistake to be sent .
negative	they must have been mixed up with a reject pile ... one steak was 0 / 0 fat .
negative	got a picture if you want .
negative	mistakes_happen , but very disappointed .
negative	i ordered a part for a car and received the part for that car .
negative	the year was right but the model was wrong .
negative	when returning the item , i had to pay return shipping myself $_00 . 00 , and was charged a restocking_fee of $_00 . 00 i am out $_00 . 00 because they claim i ordered the wrong part when the right year and model are plainly written on the invoice .
negative	needless to say i won " t be doing any further business with partsgeek and i urge others to avoid them also .
negative	scam !
negative	scam !
negative	scam !
negative	worst company i ever worked with .
negative	i have been their customer for more than 0 months .
negative	i have processed around 0k in payments .
negative	yesterday i have recieved an_email_saying that my account cannot be verified .
negative	so i contacted support :
negative	chris : hey there
negative	→ i have just received an_email from you saying we could not verify the information you submitted to verify your account kurt winter .
negative	→ my name is kurt winter
negative	→ and my email is info @ storebronx . net
negative	→ i just didnt get it .
negative	i have been your customer for a while
negative	chris : let_me see here
negative	→ sure
negative	chris : ok
negative	chris : unfortunately we won_'_t be able to process payments for your account .
negative	our banks and processors hold us to strict guidelines on what we can and can '_t process for , and we won_'_t be able to offer you our services .
negative	chris : i am really sorry for the inconvenience
negative	→ well .
negative	i still got money on your account
negative	→ and i need them as soon as possible
negative	→ helloooooo
negative	------- no response .
negative	dont even try to open account with this scammers !
negative	made a purchase on supplimentwharehouse . com this is my second purchase becuase the 0st went well .
negative	this one is horrible .
negative	i placed my order online 00 / 00 .
negative	i didnt find out via_email no phone_call that they cant ship my order because my billing adress and shipping adress is different and that i had to call in to verify .
negative	i called in on the 00th to verify that it was me ordering and that it was okay to ship to my other house .
negative	i stated that i needed my product to be shipped by 00 - 0 the latest .
negative	they assured me that they could .
negative	i then on the 0th look online and it shows it hasnt been shipped yet so i call .
negative	i talk to a guy and he says he will check on it and email me the status .
negative	guess what ... . no email .
negative	i called today 000 and got karen or kristen she said she was the lead in the department who was blaming black_friday sales for the dealy when i clearly orderd my producst before black_friday .
negative	she said she would contact me today as a status but could offfer no garauntee as to when my product would be shipped .
negative	she also offered nothing as reconsiliation for the troubles .
negative	saving a few_bucks inst worth the headaches .
negative	this is horrible customer service .
negative	** update - i recieved a follow_up email from them stating they are waitning on product ????
negative	it didn_'_t show on backorder .
negative	this is rediculous .
negative	the also didn_'_t acknowledge their customer service blunders or offer anything in returen .
negative	stay back .
negative	i have the same issue as the post below mine
negative	" i ordered a game which i found at a good price .
negative	gamesrocket immediately billed my paypal_account and proceeded to send me an e_-_mail requesting a copy of my legal id / passport along with a photo of myself holding it in order to " verify " payment .
negative	gamesrocket did not feel the need to " verify " the payment in order to take the money but did feel the need to do so before delivering the product .
negative	i contacted support requesting a refund since at this point they are effectively holding the product hostage to me provinding personal information , it has_been over a week and i have received no response whatsoever "
negative	please refund my money .
negative	you could have at_least had a warning before taking our money which says a verification may need to take place which includes scanning your passport etc .
negative	worst service .
negative	not recommend one because i made 0 purchases on 00 / 0 / 00 and 00 / 00 / 00 and never received another or even satisfaction of my requests .
negative	and also not getting answers to my email , nor with the carrier .
negative	because travelocity . com mysteriously changed the start date of a ticket i was attempting to purchase , i accidentally bought a ticket for a month before i intended to .
negative	i then had to cancel that purchase and re - purchase a ticket -- with no guarantee that i won_'_t be charged a $_000 fee by the airline .
negative	every time i '_ve tried to call to sort the situation out , there is a wait time of two hours or more .
negative	so i '_m waiting to see what happens with my credit_card before spending a large chunk of a day trying to speak to someone about it .
negative	where do we start ?
negative	0 .
negative	they don_'_t sell original merchanise but rather cheap knock - offs
negative	0 .
negative	they don_'_t let you know that when you order from them
negative	0 .
negative	they are expensive for what you get .
negative	i ordered from them as they were the cheapest price - by a few pennies - for the real branded batteries i thought i was odering .
negative	they ' re prices are through the roof for the cheap knock - offs the actually deliver .
negative	0 .
negative	customer service is not helpful - they won_'_t provide the item ordered and will only take back their shoddy merchandise if i ship it there myself and subject to a restocking_fee .
negative	all around terrible experience - avoid at all costs .
negative	the online part selection engine that they offer to help non_- gear - heads like me find the right part actually identified the wrong one , which they sent me .
negative	when i asked for help identifying the correct part , i was told that if i was dissatisfied with my part , i would have to go to their website and complete a request for refund .
negative	after that , if it was approved , i ' d be issed an_rma ( whatever that is ) authorizing me to return my part for a refund ; however , i would be required to pay for return shipping , including the insurance and delivery verification fees they " highly_recommend " as they ' re not responsible for lost or damaged returns .
negative	overall , a very dissatisfactory experience that i never intend to repeat .
negative	when searching by style number the style never shows up in search .
negative	when you receive an approved credit not sure if it gets applied right_away to a new style or you pay again then credit back the credit_card used .
negative	i ordered my product over a week_ago .
negative	still_haven_'_t gotten an_email_letting_me know if my product has shipped or not .
negative	not to happy
negative	i would not ever order from this vendor again as they are unable to communicate rationally when they make an error , charge for 0 day shipping , send the wrong part and then take for never to get you the correct part .
negative	i mean what is the use of 0 day shipping ?!
negative	refund the cost of the part after many e_-_mails , but eat the shipping cost !
negative	and try to get you to pay the return shipping for their error .
negative	no phone to talk to someone directly to resolve_issues !
negative	all they care about is getting the wrong part back but they have no care about getting you the correct part that you paid_extra to get it right_away .
negative	oh just order it again .
negative	right !
negative	partsgeek is terrible !!!
negative	the package for my steering damper came with no hardware like bolts , nuts , washers and bushings and i tried to contact them but i got no where ... will never use them again
negative	poor customer service .
negative	extremely disappointed with this company !!
negative	if they can '_t find the original replacement for your sunglasses , they '_ll put their " inhouse " replacement ..
negative	wtf ????
negative	and they will charge you full repair price .
negative	once you pay , and receive your item , and realize is a cheap replacement , they will say that " their policy " states that they will replace your original with another " inhouse " option .
negative	means : chinese crap .
negative	don_'_t waste your money !!!
negative	!
negative	this company is not serious at all !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered an item 00 feb 0000 and messaged the site on 00 feb asking if it had shipped .
negative	said would check and get it sorted .
negative	messaged again 00 march , got excuse that their stock was damaged , more arriving end of week .
negative	messaged 00 march saying if not shipped by 00 march , please refund ; was promised goods and refund .
negative	messaged 00 april , gave deadline of 0 april to refund or ship else i will initiate chargeback ; responded with refund was issued ( it wasn_'_t ) and could i verify last four digits of card used .
negative	i did so , no further responses , goods or refund .
negative	on 00 april i contacted my credit_card company to chargeback .
negative	i expect site owner was trying to get purchase past 000 day limit for chargeback .
negative	so very glad i used a credit_card instead of debit_card , otherwise i would have had no_recourse .
negative	caveat_emptor .
negative	sucks !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	will never us partsgeek again
negative	unwilling to replace an incorrect item .
negative	became argumentative when dealing_with replacement .
negative	went to another company in the end .
negative	would never use again
negative	don_'_t even bother with these_guys .
negative	they messed_up the delivery in brussels , sent them to germany for the weekend and finally arrived three_days late .
negative	a paltry half dead display for the best part of € 00 .
negative	absolute rubbish and customer service was virtually non_existent with stock replies to my complaints .
negative	zero out of ten for an all_round disastrous service .
negative	shame on you flora_queen !
negative	repairing a washing_machine :
negative	- was 0 days before they could have a look
negative	- no text was sent with estimated_arrival time
negative	- apparently needed a spare part which will take another week
negative	nearly two_weeks without a washing_machine - are you joking ?!
negative	?
negative	and a week to get hold of a spare part ?!
negative	?
negative	wrong part shipped and unusable .
negative	did not discover until after i went through the process of installing to find out it was missing a key connector .
negative	i rented a full size nissan_altima from dollar out of orlando , fl .
negative	it was the best price i got on travelocity .
negative	i was initially disappointed the car had no goodies , like power seats , xm radio , etc , that i thought i ' d get with a full size .
negative	00_minutes away from the airport i found the car had a terrible shimmy at higher speed and pulled to one side on the highway , i did not go back to exchange .
negative	this was a 0 week rental , 0_weeks in , the car would not turn off .
negative	no matter what i did i could not turn off the radio , lights , etc .
negative	or the engine , i could not turn the car off .
negative	i read the manual that gave_me instructions for an " emergency shut - off " procedure , which i did and everything then turned off .
negative	from then on that is what i had to do to turn the darn thing off .
negative	then the turn signals would not work , no gauges or lights on the dash would work … so i could not tell how much gas i had or how fast i was going , and had to use hand signals for making turns .
negative	i called dollar and they agreed to exchange my car .
negative	but , i had to drive over an_hour to get a new car at another facility , which i did .
negative	that replacement car was not as well_equipped as the car i had , and it had a shimmy that was worse .
negative	for my troubles and time dealing_with the exchange , probably 0 hours of driving time , dollar credited me $_00 on a $_000 rental , i didn_'_t think that was very fair .
negative	in fact , when i turned the car in , i asked for a refund , the attendant said that was all she could do , she told me i ' d have a $_00 credit , but only $_00 showed_up on my credit_card .
negative	you get what you pay for … my experience tells_me dollar rental_cars are lemons .
negative	cheers , john
negative	after all this waiting , this radiator ordered is wrong .
negative	in order to make it fit i must drill new new holes to secure the unit .
negative	very disapointed .
negative	the car that hertz gave_me was in terrible shape , a lot of dents all over the cars , the wheels in bad shape , the rear tires with almost not tread , filthy , with dirty under wear in the rear pockets and sand all over the rear seats and front passenger_seat .
negative	the excuse that they gave_me is that they subcontract the cleaning with another company and didn_'_t have another car to get a replacement .
negative	at the return date they hit me with 00 euros extra fees !!
negative	!
negative	won_'_t rent from hertz ever again
negative	tis beengoing on 0_weeks thay sent the wrong part and im still_waiting for them to send info so i can send it back then i still need the right part

negative	the wait for the was not so unusual , but it was a long 0days .
negative	i was so upset that i received the wrong part .
negative	using your site and verifying the picture i ordered the part . i submitted the order giving all the info that was asked of me . i looked at the picture to make_sure it had the right connections the part i received had different connections that was made for an earlier model .
negative	i tried_calling to set_up an exchange but after waiting more than 00_minutes on my cell_phone i could not wait any longer . i hope to get a response thru these e_-_mail s as to the process of the exchange . i need this vehicle for work . please inform_me of the method to get the correct part as soon as possible .
negative	/ thank_you my number to reach me is 000 - 000 - 0000
negative	i ordered filters from this company on november 00 , 0000 / called them 0 days_later and they stated " we forgot to ship them " as of december_00th , 0000 i have still not received them .
negative	will not order from them again in the future ,
negative	i '_m very disappointment with my first experience with parts_geek .
negative	the website said it was the right part for my car ; however , it wasn_'_t .
negative	i had to pay right shipping , then was charged a $ 0 . 00 restocking_fee , even_though it was never installed and returned in the exact packaging that i received it in .
negative	in the end , i was out of pocket over $_00 . 00 on a $_00 . 00 part .
negative	i bought an xbox key card and couldn_'_t get it transfered to my xbox_live account .
negative	i tried to get in contact with the g0a . com support to solve the problem , but they refused to answer to my trouble tickets .
negative	even after_contacting them multiple_times , through tickets , through chat and even through paypal , they still refuse to even acknowledge the problem .
negative	terrible customer service !
negative	can not recommend at all , be aware !
negative	i ordered products and after two_weeks it didn_'_t get shipped .
negative	i e_- mailed them and they told it it was coming .
negative	still a month later nothing .
negative	i filed a paypal_dispute with them to get my money back .
negative	horrible customer service , act like they don_'_t get your emails , even through their contact form on the site , then try to blame your spam_filter .
negative	won_'_t address customer questions_regarding products or orders .
negative	many items listed as in stock really aren_'_t anymore .
negative	with so many other much_better jewellery shops online , i would avoid this place like the plague .
negative	look at their forums to see that customer service and other problems have gotten worse .

negative	i spent 00_minutes with someone_who said they were going to check and call me back .
negative	i never received a call back .
negative	i had to call back where you had to confirm what i '_m saying was true .
negative	do you know what it feels when someone questions your integrity ?
negative	after my horrible ordeal i '_m still_waiting for my credit to my credit_card .
negative	feeling very disappointed with your service .
negative	i discovered that the rate i paid this booking service was $_00 . 00 higher_than the rate i would have paid directly on checking in to the hotel .
negative	never again !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	im living in the us and ordered flowers to delivered to my mother in ireland for mothers_day .
negative	they werent delivered ..
negative	i certainly paid enough for the flowers and delivery at a rip_off price so the least you might expect is that they ' re delivered ..
negative	one leg of our trip , originally booked and paid for through travelocity , had a flight cancelled .
negative	travelocity said that they were not able to help and referred us to the airline which booked the revised flight , as travelocity was not able to do so .
negative	they left us to our own devices and efforts .
negative	if you have a problem with a flight , travelocity is not able to assist you .
negative	the international connection to the overseas customer service has consistently had a very bad connection .
negative	the operators have limited ability to do anything beyond the basics .
negative	why_bother to book through a travel_agency like travelocity if they are not able to provide you with competent assistance .
negative	in the future , i will either book the travel directly with the airlines or use another travel service .
negative	would definitely recommend
negative	we arrived in madrid_airport and followed the instructions to the resort hoppa desk for our pre_- paid booking .
negative	despite their conditions of a maximum 00_minutes delay we were told the driver would be 00_minutes so go to the cafe by the desk and he will fetch you .
negative	00 minute later nobody arrived so we went back to the desk to be told that she was unable to contact the driver .
negative	this was now one hour after we ' d arrived .
negative	on asking when the diver would arrive we were told she had no_idea as she couldn_'_t contact him . i told her therefore i had no choic ebut to take a taxi .
negative	these events were reported the following_day to resort hoppa but apart_from a note_saying they were looking into it and would get back wiuthin 00 days ( which they havent ) i have heard_nothing .
negative	they are completely_useless and i would advise agaainst anyone ever using them
negative	i ordered a pearl_necklace as a special gift for a friend in the us virgin_islands while i was visiting recently .
negative	i checked with my uk card company and got the go - ahead from them .
negative	pearlsource accepted my order and payment , but then a few_days_later contacted me to say that they could not send the pearls to a different coutry to my home address .
negative	why on earth not ?
negative	i wish they had let_me know before i ordered .
negative	because of their actions i missed the oportunity to give a special gift .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	ordered an atv repair part , did not work when received , so i called and got a merchandise return , and was e_- mailed a return shipment label .
negative	while waiting for the new part to arrive i ordered another part .
negative	after 0_weeks of not receiving either part , i called to check on the status , the guy i talked to said he has no_clue on the returned part and the other part was on backorder and would probably be another week before it would be available .
negative	( and no notice of backorder ) when i asked what about my returned part he said thats between you and fedex .
negative	offered no help at all .
negative	so now im out the part , the $_00 dollars for the part and the shipping !!!
negative	so i refunded the backorder part .
negative	never again ordering from mr cycles !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i get it , this is a place to cheaply buy parts and i understand that in order to supply parts at the prices they do they have to keep their over head low .
negative	but when i received a severely_damaged strut i expected some semblance of customer service .
negative	i had to report the issue via a website form , i have called their number multiple_times only to wait on hold for 00 plus minutes and never talk to a single person .
negative	a week after i reported the problem i finally received a return e_-_mail and it came with unclear instructions .
negative	now i have to pay to ship the damaged part back and on top of that i have to re - order the part instead of them sending me a new one automatically .
negative	if i knew i was going to have to deal with this stuff i would have gone to the corner store and gladly spent the extra $_000 that i saved .
negative	it is now the 00th witha little luck it will arrive by the 0th of july where the hell did you send the ink .
negative	there are no minus stars
negative	i am not happy with my recent_purchase .
negative	although the pricing was very reasonable , the shipping was horrible !!!
negative	i ordered a radiator on 00 / 00 / 00 , it was shipped on 00 / 00 / 00 , and when i tracked the package online that day , it stated the scheduled delivery date would be 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	i never received the package because i moved the first of november , and the post_office forwarded the item .
negative	upon checkout , there was no information stating it would be sent through united_states postal service , and was originally shipped through ups .
negative	there was also no option to receive expedited_shipping .
negative	i will_definitely think_twice about giving a good word about this site .
negative	order a watch they said they had .
negative	they took my money .
negative	waited a week while order was awaiting fulfilment .
negative	they only admitted they didn_'_t have the watch and could get it when i queried it .
negative	rubbish control and process .
negative	very poor customer service .
negative	never even apologised
negative	reservation was made incorrectly .
negative	tried to cancel and was disconnected 0 times by the customer service rep . would never recommend this company .
negative	complained to hotel_directly about reservationcounter .
negative	when i made my reservation i thought that i was speaking to marriot directly .
negative	interesting that your company name is trust_pilot because the person lied when i asked if they could take my personal info off of my rewards membership and the person said " sorry but our systems are down and we can not retrieve at this time ".
negative	in short i will never use your services again !
negative	i am still_waiting for invoice for my purchase ( which i really need ) i did receive product on time ; however i have no success in contacting customer service to receive an invoice or any e_-_mails regarding this purchase .
negative	hope they come through soon !!!!
negative	!
negative	the timing was great however the man who delivered the fuel was not , running the pipe over my car , i may not use them again
negative	traveloicity was awful there phone help is in the philipines and the guys english was
negative	awful they refused to send me a confirmation e_-_mail and thus i had the wrong return flight had to pay estra $_000 .
negative	just come_back on dates i wanted ... theuy aadmitted they didnt send e_-_mail confirmation but so sorry too bad .... never again will iclick on travelocity .....
negative	sms og mailen om at pakken er klar , det_er_den så bare_ikke , det_er heller_ikke nogle nyt i fik_jeg besked på .
negative	airsoft megastore has failed to complete my order and refuse to pony - up to their mistake .
negative	they shipped the incorrect product to me , and want me to pay shipping to send it back .
negative	the merchandise i paid for is was not delivered .
negative	did they ship it ?
negative	did they sell it to someone_else ?
negative	these are bad business_practices .
negative	i read a review of a similar situation that did not work out for the customer .
negative	this may go to small claims_court .
negative	it took 00_hours for customer service representative to respond to this situation .
negative	i placed my order and the price was great , almost too good to be true .
negative	well you know what they say about things that sound too good to be true , they usually aren_'_t .
negative	everything_went well with the order process and i waited for the item to be delivered , and waited , and waited .
negative	by the way , i '_m still_waiting ....
negative	i tried to use the tracking feature that directed me to the ups web_site , it just said that the order was placed / shipped , no further information .
negative	this same info .
negative	remains unchanged 00 days_later .
negative	i tried to contact parts_geek and their customer_support_ticket process has_been off line for about a week now .
negative	i tried_calling their 000 number and was greeted_by an_automated attendant that said to go to the web_site and complete a customer_support_ticket ......
negative	i can '_t find an option to email them and their automated attendant didn_'_t give me an option to speak with a real_person .
negative	at this point i '_m hoping that this review finds it '_s way to parts_geek and i can get some satisfaction , but somehow i doubt it .
negative	i can '_t believe all my information in the hand of foreigner supporter .
negative	you can '_t outsource all my information to philippine to do supporting .
negative	so silly ...
negative	i will never register with transunion anymore .. bad ... save cost but selling out our information ..
negative	i will give bad rating on transunion 000 %..
negative	the worst and the worst of all .
negative	selling out customer information to third country .
negative	you are betraying you customers .
negative	still_waiting for fifa_00 totally_unacceptable
negative	my flight was cancelled and i was put on a later flight i couldn_'_t use .
negative	i tried to call their number to cancel ( since i couldn_'_t do it online ) and was on hold for more than 000 minutes ( not exaggerating ).
negative	no one helped_me .
negative	tweeted about the poor customer service to the carrier ( jetblue ) and they helped_me cancel the flight in less_than 0 minutes , through twitter , with no interaction .
negative	travelocity didn_'_t even respond to my tweets until hours_later .
negative	then they sent me emails to call them again to discuss " changes to my itinerary ."
negative	as if i would spend any more time on hold with them .
negative	suffice to say , i am never using travelocity to book travel again , which is a shame because their online portal has_been my favorite to use out of all of the services .
negative	after_contacting the representative .
negative	they told me refund can only be given if the product is un - open .
negative	how am i going to know if the skin will work , without trying it on .
negative	do not suggest buy .
negative	the skin does not cover the whole phone and it does not look as good in the picture .
negative	very easy to be stretched out of shape .
negative	i probably_won_'_t be buying anymore auto_parts from you folks because of your shipping procedures .
negative	not only is your shipping expensive , it lacks any logical precision .
negative	your website said ground_shipping , so i gave you my residence address , expecting you to do what you said you would : ups or fedex .
negative	instead you mailed the parts and pocketed the savings .
negative	i don_'_t get mail at the house .
negative	that '_s why i have a po_box ( that your website wouldn_'_t let_me use as a ship to address ).
negative	so - guess where it ended_up when it hit the po ??
negative	not my house , not my po_box ( since it wasn_'_t listed on your label ).
negative	nope , it ended_up in my ex - wife '_s po_box .
negative	so , go_ahead , enjoy the laugh ....
negative	i '_ll find another company to buy from .
negative	you don_'_t want to know .
negative	it took five days to even ship my part , wich was very unacceptable , especially since they say your order processes the same day .
negative	the only information i received was that my order was processed and that my payment was processed
negative	they made sure that was done in a timely_manner .
negative	i will not order anything_else from them .
negative	it shouldn_'_t take five days to ship a part , especially when they say it takes 0 - 0 days , and it processes the day you order it .
negative	has taken almost 0_weeks and still have not see product i ordered .
negative	i had to change the name on a return flight due to family illness .
negative	the terms and conditions and email of confirmation refer to a particular fee for changing passenger details .
negative	the amount is € 00 per flight .
negative	i was charged over €_000 for a return flight , so 0 flights .
negative	not a huge_difference but it '_s an expensive exercise overall anyway .
negative	the customer service rep and manager failed to explain to me why i was charged the additional amount after an_hour on the phone .
negative	they then referred me to the faq on the bravofly website that states that an_additional_fee may be charged .
negative	i don_'_t read all the pages of a booking website when i book my flights - and i shouldn_'_t have to .
negative	i refer to the email_confirmation and any applicable terms and conditions of the booking .
negative	very disappointing experience .
negative	will never use bravofly again .
negative	i was unable to board my flights due to a booking error through expedia .
negative	not only did they refuse to help me get any flights changed but also refused to refund me .
negative	as an active_duty military service member yrying to get home to see family obviously i was unable to do so .
negative	købte_en maxam r00 monster 0 . 0 fjernstyret bil som kun kørte en tur , så_var drivakslen defekt .

negative	i had a problem with my purchase and the support refused to speak with me .
negative	i did not receive the bosch parts , 0 oil_filters 0000 infinity i 00 and a cabin_air_filter for a 0000_honda mini_van odassy .
negative	please e_mail me at benkshahbaz @_yahoo . com or call me at 000 000 0000
negative	advertise items as being in stock on the website and then when it comes down to it it gets cancelled because it was all one big lie .
negative	i brought accessories from elsewhere for my purchase that i can no_longer use .
negative	thanks a bunch .
negative	spoiled my christmas .
negative	today 0 / 00 / 00 i received a copy of my credit_report .
negative	it turns_out my beacon scored decreased because of a closed revolving credit_card from decrb / smrtcn , closed on 0 / 0000 .
negative	i had no_idea what that was nor i had applied to it , so i googled it .
negative	results came up as " paypal ".
negative	i contact paypal and talked to 0 people .
negative	customer service reps have no_clue what a credit_report is .
negative	they said that the " e_-_mail report " i am reading is incorrect and that my paypal_account is temporarily closed due to inactivity and that i need to go online to re - activate my account .
negative	the last manager finally was able to tell me that when i apply to a paypal_account , they apply for a revolving credit_card on my behalf .
negative	i told them i never received a credit_card from paypal .
negative	they told me that it is an online credit_card through ge financial and transfered me to that company .
negative	i talked to 0 people over at paypal ge financial who told me that because i had 00 months of inactivity , my credit_card was closed by them in 0 / 0000 which decreased my beacon score .
negative	i asked them when did i apply online or sign an application for a credit_card through them .
negative	i demanded to see such documents .
negative	they responded that such documents are not available but they can send me a copy of the terms and condition , which were modified this year .
negative	i asked them that since i am supposedly a credit_card member , i should have received a copy of those terms and conditions and i didn_'_t .
negative	the manager again apologized and said there is nothing she can do the account was closed and i can re - apply again , but ge money - paypal smart connect cannot contact the credit agencies to let them know that i was not informed that my account would be closed .
negative	i told her that there is no accountability on their end , that i would have made a transaction should i had known that i had a credit_card with them ( which i didn_'_t know because i did not apply for one ) that was about to be closed because i did not make any purpose .
negative	again , i didn_'_t know i had a " credit_card " through them , therefore i didn_'_t make any purchase using such online credit_card .
negative	i told her that i am a credit analyst at a bank and that i would report ge money - paypal smart connect to the bbb because they falsely issued an online credit_card without my consent and without an application from me , and furthermore , they closed such credit_card again without my consent or without previous notification , without receiving any terms and conditions , and now my credit has_been adversely affected by their negligence and unethical practices .
negative	then she ( kelly , she would not disclose her last name ) hung_up .
negative	i am shocked that both ge and paypal would do such thing .
negative	i was sent the wrong part .
negative	i only realized it after the car was put on a lift and the old part removed .
negative	after an exhaustive search , one was located a 00 minute drive away .
negative	the old part was replaced , i picked_up the right part , and returned to the shop to have it installed .
negative	the lack of the correct part cost me $_000 for to replacement and $_00 extra to remove and install the part the second time .
negative	i can '_t afford to do_business with you .
negative	i ordered an ecu model number mc 000 and they sent me 0 with a different model number that the car would not start up with cold then called customer service and was on hold for over 0 hours of calling and then you know anybody answered the phone
negative	february 0 we did buy tickets for 0 persons thru bravofly .
negative	amount debited was 000 . 00 eur inclusive noproblem travel_insurance .
negative	february 0 we did find out that we had to cancel the tickets because our meeting we were to go for was cancelled .
negative	we did only get 00 . 00 eur back which is a low sum back .
negative	we will not use bravofly anymore .
negative	dpd do not deliver my parcel to my home .
negative	no bell when they come before my house , only left paper in mail box where they inform_me about my parcel and that i must collect my parcel from they warehouse in next 0 working days , or they send my parcel back to sender .
negative	when speaking with somebody from dpd it was polish , with very bad english , which give me his wife to speak instead of him and even his wife has bad english , so i do not understand nothing as well .
negative	this could take hours , but i '_ll give the short version .
negative	placed order on 0 / 00 / 00 , was told the order would ship in 0 - 0 days .
negative	after no contact for 00 days , ( my credit_card was charged day one ) i had an online_chat with a " customer service rep ".
negative	was told that my prescription was " incomplete " even_though the prescription was recorded in my order on their website !
negative	i gave them the info ( i opened another page and actually read my prescription to them from their website ).
negative	was told the order would be rushed .
negative	several phone_calls , emails , and chats later i gave up and attempted to cancel my order .
negative	surprise , surprise my glasses shipped the next_day .
negative	six_weeks after_placing the order i recieved my glasses .
negative	be very careful if trying to book hotel on marriott site .
negative	expedia is fooling people .
negative	read web_site to make_sure you are on marriotts web_site , otherwise you will pay too much .
negative	fool me once , shame on you !!!
negative	you will never get my business again , and i will warn all of my friends and co - workers of your deceptive ways .
negative	item was never packaged , it was dirty , warped , full of dents , labels with a glue that never comes off , etc .
negative	really unacceptable .
negative	nothing i would want to put on my car .
negative	will never by from this company again .
negative	this item was for a show car for the love of god , not a lawn tractor !
negative	one star is to much .......... :-(
negative	i thought i was working directly with hampton_inn , not a 0rd_party and there was no notice i was working with someone other than hampton_inn .
negative	i found this out when i checked in and the hotel could not help me because the reservation was not made with them directly and when i checked out and the hotel could not even generate a receipt for me .
negative	as a result , i will never stay at hampton_inn again .
negative	not only did you screw up my order by not sending me what i purchased but it took days to hear from your customer service .
negative	its been a week and i need this part as soon as possible because it is a critical part to my car .
negative	and now your asking me to return it and go thru this whole_process .
negative	its faster for me to just go to another website and order the part from someone_else .
negative	unbelievable how terrible rthe service .
negative	ordered part and recieved part in a reasonable length of time .
negative	however , upon_receiving the ( electrical casted part ) in a box that looked like it came over on the mayflower ( delapidated ) not only was the seal on the box broken it had been taped and re - taped finding the part broke in two pieces & wrapped only in one small sheet of bubble_wrap .
negative	very poorly_packaged for shipping a fragil casted electrical coil_pack that should have been shipped in a solid casted styro foam protectant .
negative	i instantly contacted geekspart . com telling them about receiving the damaged part .
negative	they replied telling_me how to send back the damaged part and how they were not responsible for shipping of a pooly package part back to them !!!!!
negative	after several emails explaning to them how all the above requesting them to call me asap , all i receive is email after email how to re - order and send the damaged part back .
negative	nothing about refunding the damaged part and sending me another .
negative	i am so glad that they sent me this survey as i continue to battle them on just getting someone from geeksoparts . com to call me .
negative	extremely unhappy with the response and now going on the second week and still nothing !
negative	i have never had this poor service from any other auto part web_site .
negative	please somebody from geeks part . com call me .
negative	my next step is to call my credit_card and stop payment on order .
negative	we had a wwii london tour booked a couple of months ahead of our visit .
negative	on the morning of the tour , we called to confirm that everything was on schedule and they said it was .
negative	we wasted the morning just walking around and having a lengthy lunch so that we ' d be on time for the 0pm departure .
negative	when we showed_up at the tour office , they told us the tour had been cancelled due to not enough people booked on it .
negative	so they screwed us .
negative	they easily could have called us because they had our phone_number and we had service in the u . k .
negative	i don_'_t want my money back , i want my vacation time back .
negative	i will never book through viator again .
negative	i tried to cancel this order within five_minutes of submitting it and they claimed it cold not be done that it had already been fulfilled by their warehouse .
negative	i don_'_t believe it .
negative	will not use them again because i found the product at half the price they charged .
negative	ordered a 00 - 00 000 cassette and got an 00 - 00 so a real_pain and just extra hassle to have to change .
negative	disappointed as first order .
negative	rather_than explain in detail why i was unhappy with my experience with cash 0 phones i feel it would be more appropriate to give helpful information to others who are either considering or have already used this company .
negative	it '_s a bit of a review within a guide .
negative	firstly , as you are probably aware , c0p '_s is somewhat of a scam company and uses a variety of classic methods to essentially extract as much money out of you as possible .
negative	here '_s how it works ;
negative	0 .
negative	on price comparison_sites you will notice that c0p '_s offers the best cash for handsets , far higher_than mazuma or any of the other legitimate recycling phone companies .
negative	this is the ' bait '.
negative	0 .
negative	you will receive an extremely flimsy piece of packaging to send your phone to c0p , you will then consider to send your handset via special delivery .
negative	this is of course expensive so you will be far more tempted to simply use the packaging they provided and ' chance it '.
negative	you will of course now be worried that your handset will be broke in the post .
negative	0 .
negative	you will receive a email from c0p '_s indicating that your handset has ' significant wear and tear ' and you will be offered a revised figure anywhere between 00 - 00_%_off the original value .
negative	it doesn_'_t matter what condition you sent the phone in , 0 times out of 00 you will receive this standard email .
negative	those_who used the flimsy packet to send the package will be receptive to this ' wear and tear ' excuse as you will likely already be concerned that the handset was damaged in the post .
negative	0 .
negative	you will be given only 0 days to make your mind up regarding whether or not to accept this value .
negative	the option is to accept this poor offer or reject it , you will obviously want to reject this offer but it will then become clear that if you reject their poor offer you will have to pay them £ 0 . 00 in postage_costs this is the ' hook '.
negative	at this point several different outcomes can occur .
negative	a ) you do not act on this email or have not checked your email for a few_days , after 0 days the offer is accepted automatically so c0p '_s will have extracted a decent sum of money from you .
negative	b ) you think that it is probably not worth the hassle and just accept , the delivery cost to reject the phone back will reinforce this thinking .
negative	those of you who decided to send the phone by special delivery will have already made a loss and are therefore receptive to ' cutting your losses '.
negative	those that did not will also psychologically think that it '_s your / royal mails fault anyway .
negative	either of these situations are ideal for c0p '_s .
negative	c ) you email c0p '_s regarding the situation and express your unhappiness ( more on this in a bit ) and do not phone , it '_s a 0000 number and you will be kept on ' hold ' for a very long time .
negative	also do not click either ' accept offer ' or ' reject ' if you plan on contesting it .
negative	0 .
negative	if you are contesting their offer they will apologise for ' human_error ' in terms of the valuation and offer you a revised ' counter - offer '.
negative	the extent of the ' counter - offer ' very much depends on your correspondents and the ' human_error ' excuse is stock , everyone will get it .
negative	if you came_across angry or ill - informed they will likely offer you a improved but still ' poor ' offer , knowing that you feel strongly about this situation and are emotionally invested .
negative	they will use this to their advantage as this indicates that you want a resolution quickly and will accept a poor offer .
negative	if you come_across as well informed and calm then they will give you a significantly improved offer that '_s very close to what they originally offered .
negative	the best way to do this is mention that you are in contact with trading_standards , the gravy train at c0p '_s will soon be running out and they know it .
negative	a trading_standards investigation is currently ' ongoing ' and bbc watchdog is keeping a close eye on c0p '_s and they know it .
negative	exploit this fact !
negative	0 .
negative	the ' sell part ' in both situations in number 0 is that their counter - offer will nearly always be less_than what they quoted , just below the actual market value if you have come_across well in correspondents but because you have already been through the scam '_s initial hassle you are very very likely to just take this value .
negative	you will think you somehow ' won_' because you got a reasonable_amount of money but really you didn_'_t because you still got less_than what you were originally offered .
negative	although to be honest it is probably best to indeed accept this offer rather_than fight for the full_amount .
negative	in my own personal experience i was offered £_00 , reduced to £_00 . 00 when received and by following the above advice managed to get £_00 .
negative	0 .
negative	the final part is that c0p '_s is prone to delaying payout '_s , this is their last line of defence and works in that statistically some people will not notice that they did not receive there payment .
negative	if this occurs , just keep emailing them and eventually they will know that you ' re not going anywhere .
negative	just remember c0p '_s operates just like most other scams of this nature .
negative	they have a set series of scenarios that statistically demonstrate a high probability of customers ' giving up ' and just accepting the scam and play on simple psychological evaluation .
negative	i go there with high_hopes knowing ive been there years_ago and that was my home town and i had faith in the people in the town and business ........... and to make a point of the reason_why i say i am truly unhappy is ... my usb 00v charger was missing from the socket after a couple minutes from leaving the bussiness ........
negative	i will truly not recommend this place and will with not much effort spread the word ......
negative	thank_you new britain town_fair_tire !!!
negative	..... its the principal that counts here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	i received my valentine '_s flowers on february 00 .
negative	they were scheduled for delivery on february_00th and the order was placed on february_00th .
negative	turns_out that this gift was supposed to include balloons as well .
negative	were you looking_forward to coming home and seeing that knowing look on your valentine '_s face ?
negative	how about that intimate phone_call of joy and happiness for the thoughtful gift you had delivered ?
negative	not with avas_flowers !
negative	someone should sue them !
negative	i can '_t tell you the damage that was created by the trust that was placed in this avas " company ".
negative	naturally , me and my valentine worked it out and realized it was the fault of these love scammers but as long as it isn_'_t for a major holiday , you don_'_t order early , or expect to get what you paid for , then by all means , give this place a try .
negative	because , if you are going to forget about someone , might as well pay someone to help you do it !
negative	i have bought alot of different parts online and i have to say that parts_geek is the worst . i ordered a heater_core and a radiator both where not even close to what i have .
negative	now i have to pay to ship back parts that they screwed_up .
negative	these_people should go back and check thier part numbers .
negative	and now i have to wait at_least a month to get a refund .
negative	plus im out shipping_charges i hope everyone reads there return_policy before they order from here .
negative	plus you cannot call them they must not have time to talk to anyone . whoever reads this think before you buy and good luck this place sucks .
negative	sent me wrong part , plus not easy to return !
negative	now i will wait another week for the part !
negative	we had dirty stained towels , fridge didn_'_t work , and water was cut_off on us .
negative	i called the front_desk to complain .
negative	i was told we would have to wait at_least 00_minutes before water would come_back on .
negative	they were working on the pipes .
negative	they also delivered only 0 clean towels for a room of 0 people .
negative	asked for more but never received .
negative	we were charged an extra $_00 per_night upgrade fee for oceanfront .
negative	i asked for a refund because it was not an upgrade if you can '_t shower when you want .
negative	the front_desk_clerk told me no .
negative	we will never waste our money here again .
negative	total dump !
negative	!
negative	absolutely the worse experience i '_ve ever had with an online purchase .
negative	first item we were shipped was a completely different set of glasses we had ordered .
negative	had son try them on anyway to check the prescription and it was also wrong .
negative	contacted customer service to return and was told they would immediately get started on and ship out correct pair .
negative	a week after i had confirmation they had received the incorrect order back i received a phone_call , and email with another shipping_label , telling_me i need to ship the others back .
negative	when i told the woman i had confirmation that they had already received them she proceeded to hang_up on me .
negative	two_weeks_later we received the second_pair of prescription_sunglasses and they did not have the transitional lenses in them that were ordered and paid for so we had to send them back as well .
negative	i refused to let them try for a third time as we are already 0 - 0_weeks into this process and out almost $_000 on the glasses .
negative	still_waiting for our refund even_though i have confirmation that the second_pair of glasses has_been delivered back to them .
negative	i '_m extremely shocked that the major brand_names , like oakley , allows them to carry their product .
negative	we will absolutely never try to purchase anything from this company ever again and strongly_recommend no one else does as well .
negative	my fly from madrid to london was cancel about the strike on french .
negative	i pay the ticket , i will try to return the money , but nobody writte to me .
negative	i will make_sure everyone_knows never to buy from partsgeek !!
negative	they have no customer service and no way to talk with a live_person if you have a problem .
negative	the only way to contact them is through email .
negative	there are a lot of other reviews out there explaining the same thing .
negative	wished i ' d seen them first .
negative	they just buy parts from outside sources and have them sent to you .
negative	they have no_idea what you are getting .
negative	do your research and buy it from someone_else .
negative	there are other_places selling the same items at comparable prices .
negative	don_'_t let partsgeek stay in business by ripping you off !!
negative	!
negative	on day 00 of chivalry acquired a key to pay at the moment , i have not received anything , the live_chat does not work and i do not answer to the support_ticket , it seems a shame ... in the end it '_s not worth saving a euros
negative	it took 0 days for them to charge my card .
negative	then about a week_later , they sent me an_email_telling_me that they were issuing a refund , but did not tell me why .
negative	i had to file an inquiry , for which it took them 0 more days to reply .
negative	it turns_out they never had the part nor any idea of when they would get it .
negative	they also had the nerve to ask me to call them back in 0_weeks to see if the part would become available .
negative	what a joke !
negative	the product i ordered was not shipped in any form of protection or box .
negative	i received it as is but only in two_separate pieces .
negative	the part i needed was keeping me from driving my vehicle making it difficult to go to work everyday .
negative	so not only was i upset when it took_longer then expected to receive it , but i was more upset when it wasnt packaged at all and was broken .
negative	all in all i will not be buying from parts_geek ever again due to their laziness .
negative	p . s .
negative	i emailed them two_days ago about this and i have yet to hear from them
negative	my items didn_'_t turn up .
negative	i rang them to which their response was royal_mail may not have put a missed ticket through my door .
negative	even_though i had been in every time the post turned_up .
negative	he then said they won_'_t send a replacement until they receive it back to them as undelivered because they didn_'_t want to be 0 products down .
negative	very very poor
negative	i have now been to my local depot and suprise it is not there it now seems that its my problem i i chose royal_mail non tracked
negative	needed to return a part , then figure_out that i did not have to after all .
negative	never got to talk to anyone , customer service number just goes on and on , you never get anyone .
negative	everything you get is automated , you get like 00 emails , but you can never talk to anyone if you have a problem or need to clarify something .
negative	ordered part and did not receive it .
negative	customer service is not responsive with any useful info .
negative	where is my part or my refund !
negative	!
negative	no one ever answers the phone .
negative	returning a part is a process from hell .
negative	the only communication you have with partsgeek . com is a half a ## email ticket that no one ever returns your call .
negative	bought a game on shopto paid for next_day delivery which was £ 0 , had an_email the same night from shopto to say my game would be delivered between 0 - 0 the next_day with a reference to track the parcel .
negative	it got to 0pm the next_day and i had not had any delivery so i phoned the courier dpd and they said shopto had not forwarded anything to them to be delivered and i should phone shopto , i phoned and spoke to a man who said " sorry as you ordered after 0pm you were not able to have next_day delivery " i asked why the website would let_me pay for next_day delivery and he said " what do you want me to do cancel the order ?"
negative	so i cancelled the order and will never buy anything from shopto again .
negative	it '_s a shame as you were recommended to me and no the person_who recommended you will no_longer use you either .
negative	this feedback is probably a waste of time i don_'_t expect anyone to read this and action it let_alone an_apology letter or compensation
negative	yours
negative	a truly unhappy former customer
negative	i would not recommend .
negative	pay more and to auropart
negative	000_% fakes , i bought armani watch the quality of the watch was relay bad even from the box you can say its 000_% fake don_'_t waste your money on them because its fakes . the quality of the watch was really bad so disappointed just good one thing didn_'_t spend a lot that '_s one good thing ...: ddd keep away from that site ....
negative	still_waiting for a reply from superdry .
negative	i ordered on tuesday 0 / 00 .... i finally get a tracking_number 0 days_later and my part arrives on the 00th at 0pm ... are ya fkin kidding me ??
negative	00 days from order to arrival ??
negative	yeah that '_s fast ....... if this was 0000 !!!!!!!!
negative	ok yeah i saved $_00 but it backed_up my actually doing the repair by a week since i don_'_t have another day off until oct 0st .
negative	they do not get you the best rates ...... they simply offer you the reduced rate based_upon you paying up front for the hotel booking .
negative	you can do this on other_sites .
negative	difference here is that they make_sure to hide the fact that most hotels do not allow you to cancel you reservations , even the day after you booked it .
negative	they have horrible customer service reps and they are difficult to reach ....... stay_away !!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a part and it was the wrong one - right part number , wrong part in the box .
negative	it took_forever to get another one .
negative	their customer service replies were horrendous and when placing a phone_call to the customer service , one got a recording then music -- forever .
negative	when trying to get to another line to place an order , more music and no one picked_up .
negative	when trying to get a second rma_number , i was told i had maxed out my number of tries and to refer to the original ticket .
negative	i did and it kicked me out again .
negative	no one has called , i cannot get in touch with anyone , just the same " thank_you for ordering and a customer rep . will get in touch with you ."
negative	never did .
negative	this is the most horrible experience i have ever had in ordering online .
negative	this company needs to go out of business .
negative	i just opened the box and filled them with water and 0 out of the 0 have leaks .
negative	just very disappointing .
negative	y
negative	i am not happy that you did not even respond to my email request for the information on how and where to send the core , for the return of the core_charge .
negative	please send asap
negative	well , i suppose one positive is that they asked me to review them , even_though it '_s been 0 months since i placed my order , never received anything from that order , and they never responded to e_-_mails , and their phone inbox was full .
negative	thanks to this company , i now have some experience getting my credit_card company to reverse a charge , because mosaic tile direct was completely unresponsive to my questions about why my order hadn_'_t shipped over two months after i placed it .
negative	saying they have poor customer service would be an insult to companies with poor customer service which actually responds .
negative	mosaic tile direct did not respond in the slightest to any of my questions asking why my shipment hadn_'_t happened .
negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone at all .
negative	my most_recent experience with travelocity was a disaster .
negative	the snowstorm on january 0rd closed down the airports in new_york .
negative	when i called customer service i got a guy in india who was clueless as to what was going on in the northeast part of the united_states .
negative	i needed to re - book my flight .
negative	he told me to go to the airport as my flight was not delayed and wouldn_'_t even offer me any help !!!
negative	ended_up calling delta directly and the guy there re - booked our flight for the next_day -- no_worries .
negative	how can someone on another continent provide customer service when they don_'_t know what is going on with the weather -- totally stupid .
negative	will think_twice about booking with travelocity again .
negative	this place has really low price , but there costumer service is horrible .
negative	when i ordered my part they canceled my order after 0 days , so i called them , and was on hold for over 0 hours and still no one picked_up .
negative	so i sent an e_-_mail from there ticket and it took 0 days to get an answer from them .
negative	and they told me the pace was never canceled .
negative	then they redid my order and sent me a tracking_number that was to a different state than i live in .
negative	i did finally get my part after 0_weeks from when i first ordered my part .
negative	so they do have the best price , but you will pay for it by there lack of cs and poor shipping .
negative	i will much rather buy form other place for a few more bucks than ever buy from partsgeek . com .
negative	still_waiting to receive the contacts we ordered .
negative	no word on when they will arrive .
negative	my buddy introduced me to vpx meltdown diet pills but they are kinda expensive so i started looking all over the net and found supplementwarehouse . com .
negative	they advertised lowest_prices guaranteed !
negative	i didn_'_t believe at first but after entering a website that had a lower price to my surprise not only did they match lowest_price but i also got an_additional 0 %_discount .
negative	wow you don_'_t find companies this good any more .
negative	upade …..
negative	0 day later they ship me the product at regular price .
negative	what a piece of shit company .
negative	thanks for wasting my time !!
negative	now to get my money back i have to refuse the package and once they receive it back they '_ll refund my money .
negative	hello .
negative	i was looking for a standing punch bag over internet .
negative	i found one on uk_sport imports .
negative	so i bought it and was waiting for my item for 0_weeks .
negative	too_long , isn_'_t it ?
negative	ok , i got it .
negative	i tried my bag the same day as i received it .
negative	i found it useless .
negative	a light punch makes the bag shaking as drunk .
negative	a kick pushes the bag as it were a baloon .
negative	ok .
negative	i decided to return it back to the sender .
negative	they said they had 0days money back warranty .
negative	i got the address the item to be sent to .
negative	i paid for this service 00 pound , the bag costs 000 pound .
negative	now the whole week passed i have not gotten any message from the uk_sport imports , no money back , nothing .
negative	it is paid 000 pound at the moment with having nothing at the output .
negative	sure i will fight for this matter with uk_sport imports .
negative	in other_words , everyone who_likes stuff like this can purchase from them .
negative	as to me : never , don_'_t recommend to my friends .
negative	in researching my code p0000 , i purchased a catalytic_converter from parts_geek , thinking it was a good move because it was less_expensive then the dealer price , but i made a huge mistake !
negative	yes it was $_000 for both pieces , compared to dealer price $ 0000 . 00 .
negative	however , my check_engine_light remains on !
negative	i have a 0000_toyota sequoia .
negative	i cannot register the vehicle , because this part is a fraud !
negative	i sent my vehicle to a toyota_dealership and spent $_00 .
negative	on a diagnostic test .
negative	they told me the part was useless , it cannot perform the needed tasks to clear the check_engine_light .
negative	the part looks exactly like the original , but its useless !
negative	parts_geek never even warned me it might not work !
negative	i will never purchase from them again !
negative	why can '_t people be honest ?
negative	totally disgusted !
negative	!
negative	rude , liars , un professional .
negative	after booking my trip for 0 / 00 they made the tickets for 0 / 00 and did not notify me nor rein verse my money and i bought the protection_plan !!!!
negative	!
negative	great product , great price , very quick door to door , but a big no do not use bc of the surprised shipping_charges !!
negative	!
negative	this is the second time that the picture wasn_'_t the same as the glasses recieved .
negative	the last time it took a month and a half to get a refund which didn_'_t cover the shipping .
negative	also one pair was broken when we opened the package .
negative	visited this site to purchase a steel cutting blade wednesday_morning , said the item was in stock , and because i had ordered early morning i could expect the item in two_days , monday i phoned customer_services to find out where my order was , i was told told it was coming from the manufacturer direct ( why say it was in stock ) i was promised it would be delivered tuesday , wednesday i phoned again explaining all that had gone on , i was then promised the blade would be with me between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 , finally arrived at 0 . 00 , think carefully about ordering from this firm if you have a deadline to meet , e . lynch .
negative	purchased a set of rear_struts for my veichle using parts_geek '_s part numbers .
negative	the order was accepted but i was informed in an e_-_mail the part number was changed .
negative	i looked up the revised part number in the manufactures catalog and found it was not compatable with the year listed my vehicle .
negative	submitted a customer request to try and stop the delivery .
negative	according to parts_geek once an order is placed you cannot stop or revise a shippment .
negative	there is no phone_number to call to interrupt their ordering and delivery scheme .
negative	needless to say the substituted wrong parts arrived and it cost me $_00 . 00 dollars to have the parts returned to parts_geek .
negative	at this point i '_m not sure i '_ll get full purchase credit back for a mistake that was not my fault .
negative	when the part number was changed by parts_geek i feel that i should have been contacted and given a choice to accept or cancell the order and not just rammed through a system they find convenient and irresponsible .
negative	i learned a hard and expensive lesson .
negative	be very carefull when ordering from this company .
negative	fluctuating shipping prices to make it appear as a discounted price .
negative	if you have a coupon , your shipping_costs become more .
negative	bought a hosting plan for a school projekt , at first everything was fine but after a couple of hours my account was immediatly suspended for completely bs reasons .
negative	i got my money back but i will never buy from them again !
negative	købte_en server sammen_med_min ven , og_der_har_ikke været end problemer .
negative	ftp var broken og serveren kunne_ikke stoppes .
negative	having placed my order i was told there would be a delay in dilivery ... not a problem i first thought but when some time had passed i contacted tennisnuts to ask when i might recieve the goods .
negative	i was promised next_day but the following_day i was e_mailed by another member of staff saying they were out of stock of one item and did i still want the other item .
negative	total case of one hand not knowing what the other hand was doing .
negative	ordered a side_view_mirror for my car .
negative	it did not fit .
negative	i returned the mirror and have not received a credit too my credit_card .
negative	it '_s been over 0 three 0 months .
negative	never again will i order from "" partsgeek ""
negative	service is fine , but i cannot turn off the ridiculous amount of spam they send .
negative	i have unsubscribed repeatedly , but i can '_t tell you how many emails they ' re sent just today .
negative	screwed my order up after 00 days waiting eventhough they phoned to confirm the item with me !
negative	which they then denied they had done , obviously so they could deny liability and refuse a return .
negative	cost me a fortune as not only am i stuck with a bumper i have no use for but i have had to return the car to the leasing co . who are now billing me 0 times as much to fix it !
negative	google '_s new privacy_policy sold us out .
negative	do no evil .
negative	ha
negative	totally unsatisfactory experience .
negative	still trying to get a simple wiper_blade .
negative	$_00 shipping_charges back and forth and still counting .
negative	bad company .
negative	don_'_t walk , run away from parts feel .
negative	received the wrong part and am still_waiting a week_later for authorization to return and have not hear if they plan on shipping the correct part .
negative	will be contacting my change card company and filling a dispute .
negative	0st time ever buying a part online .
negative	the part was not new as it said on partsgeek . com on top of that it did not even work .
negative	and on top of that now i have to spend more money to ship it back .
negative	i will never buy a part online ever again thanks to them
negative	i need to talk to some one about a defective a c compressor .
negative	messed_up my consignment twice , stating that an item was out of stock .
negative	called 0 days_later and was told it wasn_'_t out of stock but this meant shipping had been held up .
negative	still didn_'_t arrive , had to continually chase my order .
negative	was then told it was complete and would be sent .
negative	then i was told that another 0 items were missing ( shower cubical and tray ).
negative	how can these be missed ?
negative	ended_up cancelling these items and buying them from another supplier .
negative	i was told that i would receive a call from courier to arrange delivery - i didn_'_t .
negative	i had to call the day it was arriving for delivery time was told they would call me back - didn_'_t happen .
negative	called again and it arrived as i was on the phone .
negative	rarely returned my calls , cost a fortune on a mobile .
negative	stated 0 - 0 working days that ended_up to be 0_weeks that cost me extra to pay a waiting plumber .
negative	i am considering legal_action .
negative	friday june_00th 0000 .
negative	dismal start to fortnight '_s italian holiday with thompsons holidays .
negative	all check - in procedures carried_out on - line before arrival at airport with pre_- printed boarding_passes , expecting to only have to drop - off bags on arrival .
negative	arrived at 0 . 00am for flight departure at 0 . 00am , had to join existing horrendous queue that was for all thompson flights , regardless of departure time or destination .
negative	this took 0 hour to get bags dropped - off , then we joined another queue for passport control that took almost another hour , and ended_up with us being given priority to enable us to catch our plane on time .
negative	this situation appears to have applied to most people on our flight .
negative	we have never experienced conditions like this before and will seriously_consider our options in future .
negative	i '_ll write telling you like it is .
negative	ordered two hoses for 00 isuzu rodeo both hoses were wrong for the app .
negative	inside dia .
negative	and length , had too improvise the 0 / 0 in .
negative	hose to fit , ate the other because wrong inside dia .
negative	0 / 0in .
negative	instead of 0 / 0 .
negative	didn_'_t have anymore time to wait for corrections , went to auto_zone and they helped .
negative	also had to pay separate shipping because the two parts came from different_warehouses but showed_up in the same box .
negative	if this is how you do things no thanks , will not recommend to no one
negative	placed the order for my moms driver_side_mirror feb 0th 0000 .
negative	it is now march 0st and only mirror i have is in my bathroom upon further contact , and that in itself is stressfull with disconnections happening to the point of frustration and hours on hold then kick off and you start over .
negative	then you find system canceled my order not informing or asking me ? it is my order .
negative	i placed second order two_weeks_ago and still no mirror & i am not getting on the phone will order some where else and return parts_geek mirror if it ever come i will go else where and pay more but worth the peace of mind ....

negative	try their contact centre - all lines busy , even and callback doesn_'_t work .
negative	never complain_about the post_office again , these_guys are useless
negative	i ordered a hozelock bioforce 0000 from you because it appeared to be a good price .
negative	it seems it was to good to be true , i ordered it at the beginning of the week which would have given time for delivery and for me to fit it whilst still on holiday .
negative	i decided to call a few_days after ordering to get a eta to be told it was discontinued which i already new and could not get anymore .
negative	the job could not be completed on my holiday because of your inadequate system .
negative	it took 00 days for them to tell me they were out of stock of products i ordered .
negative	0 email run - arounds during that time - frame .
negative	no_recourse but to ask for refund , which to their credit they did do , 00 days_later !
negative	avoid them , they don_'_t know what they ' re doing .
negative	got this cause my other identity sold out through my bank , i was under the assumption that i would get updating credit_reports with my monthly_fee , guess i was wrong .

negative	first question that should be asked by customer service is - do you have private insurance ?
negative	if you do then you do not need this extra insurance .
negative	fact .
negative	i recently went on line and searched local delivery for the los_angeles area .
negative	avas came up with the caption " local delivery for los_angeles " i ordered the flowers i wanted expecting for them to be delivered locally .
negative	when i got to the check out they added an_additional $_00 . 00 which was not disclosed anywhere until the check out .
negative	i decided to go forward with the order so as to not have any delays since they were for my girlfriend the following_day .
negative	my main_concern was that i did not want them to arrive in a ups box the whole point of getting delivered and searching for local delivery was that they would be delivered by a driver .
negative	not via_ups in a box .
negative	immediately after the order i received an_email which said if i had any comments or concerns to please contact them .
negative	immediately i emailed them expressing my concern about not wanting them to go ups .
negative	they never replied .
negative	the next_day i contacted them again and was told they did indeed to out ups .
negative	they said those flowers i choose didn_'_t apply for the delivery and that i received such a good price i should basically live with it .
negative	horrible customer service .
negative	after i realized that the flowers did not arrive in a vase as i had indicated in the order .
negative	not only did i not receive the order the way i wanted to but the order was wrong .
negative	since the flowers went in a box and they didn_'_t arrive in a vase or where handled locally the flowers immediately died .
negative	i '_ll never use them again .
negative	i dislike any company on the internet that offers a free_trial then requests my credit_card ?
negative	00 essential contracts to legally bulletproof your business includes :

negative	noncompete agreement
negative	independent contractor agmt .

negative	corporate bylaws

negative	i have had too many bad_experiences trying to cancel credit_cards with online marketers that have recurring billing built into their products or services .
negative	kind of a shame because it looked promising .
negative	i ordered a netball hoop set for my daughter and as i needed it for saturday_morning i ordered thursday , paid the extra for next_day delivery and waited at home friday for it to arrive .
negative	no such luck .
negative	with no sign of the delivery , despite a ' your item has_been dispatched ' email , i called the company at the end of the day , i got a recorded " we are now closed " on saturday i managed to get through to someone and was told " sorry no deliveries over the weekend , it '_s outsourced but i promise someone will call you 0st thing monday " annoying but hey , sometimes these things_happen .
negative	on monday_morning i received a call assuring me the delivery would be there that day , not convenient for me to spend another day home but i really needed the item .
negative	by the end of monday , with no sign of the delivery , i was pretty annoyed .
negative	another call to the company to be told " no no it '_ll be with you tomorrow " no apology , no_explanation and no responsibility taken .
negative	it did finally arrive on tuesday , three wasted days how frustrating .
negative	utterly , utterly useless service .
negative	my advice would be to use any of the other_companies out there offering the same items , same price with some semblance of customer service !
negative	!
negative	easytobook . com isn_'_t a pleasant agency to work with .
negative	with all of the distractions in booking with all the stuff on the screen , it is easy to make a mistake .
negative	easy to book doesn_'_t allow for human_error .
negative	they are all perfect there .
negative	i purchased a game card from this site , the activation never came so i e_- mailed them .
negative	they said they were aware of the problem and to e_-_mail the customer_support of some other website .
negative	should have either given me the code right then or refunded my money .
negative	now i have neither
negative	parts did come quick .
negative	axles were not empi as_advertised on website !
negative	in fact empi doesn_'_t even make complete axles anymore ( i called them ).
negative	the axles were poorly_packed and the axle nut was damaged and unusable on one axle .
negative	will not be using partsgeek in the futere , i should have payed more attention to the reviews !!!

negative	ordered polk audio in - wall speakers on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	on my emailed receipt i received a notice that my products were back ordered and estimated to ship in 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	it is 00 / 00 / 00 and the tracking_number link continues to display my product will ship in 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	flustered i reached out to samtech today and received an_email_stating that my product is scheduled to be shipped at the end of next week ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) and then of course tack on another 0 - 0 for shipping .
negative	i have requested my money back at this point .
negative	although i paid by credit_card and my money was instantaneously taken from my account , it is going to take 0 - 0 days to refund my money through paypal ?
negative	not happy with my experience but will happy to be done with this company .
negative	steer_clear .
negative	truly disappointing that polk audio would distribute through this company .
negative	next email going their way .
negative	order number 0000 - 0000 from samtech 00 / 00 / 0000
negative	i first ordered my glasses on 0 / 00 .
negative	initially the frames were on backorder so it took three_weeks to receive - i do not fault framesdirect for this .
negative	however , when the glasses arrived , the lenses were incorrectly made - as they included an astigmatism feature that was not in my prescription .
negative	i mailed them back , only for it take another two_weeks for them to re - ship the order .
negative	it is now 0 / 00 and i still have not received the glasses , which appear to be stuck somewhere along the delivery .
negative	to correct their mistake , the least they could have done was ship the package with expedited delivery .
negative	framesdirect has offered no apology or compensation for the trouble .
negative	based on this experience , i would not recommend framesdirect .
negative	i would have been better off purchasing glasses through a local shop than online .
negative	even_though new look refunded me they never made it clear in there small_print that the £ 0 . 00 was seperate from the full £_00 . 00 and they are a joke and i will never use them a again
negative	thoroughly disappointed .
negative	having to send my ipod_touch back for the fourth time .
negative	first time was the on / off button that was fixed , however they ruined the touch screen .
negative	on top of all that i am still_waiting for the return slip since the 00th , the other 0 times i had it within a few hours .
negative	i called square_trade the other spoke to some and was basically told " oh well there is nothing i can do wait a few more business days "
negative	the repair facility they use is a joke , it is their fault i have to send it back again .
negative	they do not know how to follow_instructions , unless they were not given the proper instructions , which now i have to believe is a possibility .
negative	either way terrible service from both .
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	0 days now and i still have not received a return_label .
negative	i was just told to wait another 00_hours .
negative	we would be delighted if someone were to help us .
negative	we are new to this sevice .
negative	when we get a notice that there has_been action on our identidy guard account , we cannot seem to find out exactly_what has_gone on , ie if anything important is wrong .
negative	their directions are certainly not clear !
negative	separately , to ease our worries , we then look at our bank_accounts and credit_card accounts , and all seems ok .
negative	so now we are thinking of canceeling this new - to - us service . which appears of no use and go to a competitor .
negative	don_'_t be lured in by cheap prices .
negative	i was !
negative	they had the item i wanted marked as in stock and eligible for ups quick delivery .
negative	turns_out they were lying .
negative	they didn_'_t have it in stock and to cap it all , they are still to refund me .
negative	not sure what has happened to phones0u as have always taken contracts out with them for years due to their competitive prices and what used to be decent customer service .
negative	however never again !!
negative	!
negative	had a call from one of their upgrade agents advising me my o0 upgrade was due on the 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	after a long converstation and a rather agressive sales approach i gave in and agreed to upgrade .
negative	anyway changed my mind and decided to cancel ... assumed it would be no problem as i was still 0 days from when the upgrade could be processed .
negative	ring to cancel and they tell me they cant as its already been processed ?
negative	!
negative	so ring o0 and they tell me theres nothing on the account and no upgrade has_been / can be processed until the 00th chances are p0u will set_up a new account and have me call them to transfer details and activate .
negative	so ring p0u again and they them nothing has_been processed by o0 but they have processed it at their end and then told apparently the distant selling laws do not apply to their upgrades as a continuation of services ... despite the fact its a new phone , new tariff and as o0 suggest probably a new account ??!
negative	!
negative	lucky o0 said i have 0 days to cancel with them so hopefully that will all work out ok but no thanks to p0u .
negative	but never going to use p0u again , their shady sales_tactics and legal approach to the distant selling laws is unacceptable .
negative	they will_certainly be one shop i ' d be happy to see disappear from the high_street !
negative	i had a very difficult time yesterday comunicating with the operators !
negative	i kept hanging up in fustration and calling back to try to talk to somebody that i cound understand .
negative	i '_m going to try hotels . com
negative	it is awful , your videos will turn out to be trash .
negative	never received my game :/
negative	they seemed to have given me a list of different_varieties of the same part i need without listing much information about the parts .
negative	the only_thing you can really so is trust that that part will actually fit your car so i did .
negative	i received the part and noticed it was labeled for another car brand but figured the part was interchangable between the cars , still trusting partsgeeks . com but then once i change the part i immediately notice that the parts aren_'_t exactly clicking with my car .
negative	within a couple of days the part completely didn_'_t work and now i have to pay to get the same parts replaced again the worst thing is i have to pay for the same part again since they literally offer no returns .
negative	my wife was trying to book directly with comfort suites using her phone to search as we traveled .
negative	she did a google_search for the comfort suite that we wanted , and clicked the reservation link on what she thought was their site .
negative	the only identification used when the phone was answered was ' reservation desk '.
negative	pretty deceptive name which makes you think you have your hotel .
negative	we were booked into the wrong hotel , at a rate of 000 . 00 per_night , and the hotels highest rate was 00 . 00 .
negative	rip_off again .
negative	we tried to just cancel the reservation and book directly at the hotel that we wanted , but the nearly non english_speaking customer service rep informed my wife that it was too_late to cancel , but they would cancel if we rebooked through them .
negative	by this time it was after 0 pm , we were exhaused from driving , and just wanted to get into our room .
negative	we went_ahead and re booked with reservation desk .
negative	when i asked the hotel to use my membership number in choice hotels , i was informed that since we booked through this service , the stay would not be used toward any points or promotions .
negative	this cost us a free nights stay with choice hotels since this was our second night in their stay twice and get a free night promotion .
negative	i truly feel_like at best ' reservation desk is operating with deceptive business_practices .
negative	i will absolutely never use this service again .
negative	i also travel for business , and have 0 salesmen that travel as well .
negative	i have instructed my staff to never use this service for any travel needs .
negative	i was very impressed with your website and selection of parts .
negative	i spent over an_hour compiling the parts that i needed for repairing my son '_s vehicle in another city .
negative	i order almost $_000 worth of product from your company on my first order only to get an_email 00_hours_later stating that my order was on hold because the billing_address did not match the ship to address .
negative	the email gave instruction on what to do to remedy the situation and i did everything that it said .
negative	i chaned my bill to address with the credit_card company and entered a service ticket back to partsgeek only to be told nothing could be done .
negative	i searched the website to find a phone_number and was put on hold by an_automated attendant and was never allowed to speak with a real_person .
negative	i then track my order only to find out it was cancelled .
negative	i then placed my order with another website and have since repaired my sons vehicle .
negative	ordered and paid for 0 items received only three .
negative	contacted the support ( email is the only option ) been 0 days no reply .
negative	the order status said shipped 0 items .
negative	frustrating .
negative	may need to settle by calling my visa_card .
negative	i purchased this for my son when a smart phone was stolen , but he already had a credit watch .
negative	in attempting to cancel services , i am in my second month . it is easy to give the ig money , but to taketh away , ig does not like it .
negative	my part arrived on time and was damaged .
negative	i refused the package and have been waiting over a week to here from the company .
negative	called them to let them know i was refusing the order and asked what was the next step they told me when it came back they would take_care of it .
negative	still_waiting
negative	i cannot really add anything to the general thread of this page .
negative	i just wanted to add to the weight of evidence of how poor they are .
negative	everything written by suffering customers , i have experienced too .
negative	it '_s a very familar tale , as i read everyone '_s comments .
negative	poor poor poor .
negative	no correspondence , keep your money when in credit ( and still have my money ), our billing systems are ' having problems ' is regulary used by customer service teams .
negative	complaints never responded to and good luck to you if you need a final_bill producing .
negative	my new online account didn_'_t work , still no resolution .
negative	i was told to wait 00 days for a web team resolution .
negative	this caused me to be unaware that they had made up some arbitary direct_debit amount on my account .
negative	incorrect direct_debit amount , no - one could tell me why it was the figure it was .
negative	the ' experts ' at npower , the ones who could maybe actually sort out our problems , are ' not customer facing ' i was informed by some dis - interested service advisor .
negative	stay_away , far far away from this company
negative	i have not received the order i put in on the 00 / 00 / 0000 yet and it is now the 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	i received an_email_telling_me the order had been despatched almost_immediately i submitted the order .
negative	i rang a week_later and the problem evidently was in the internet ordering system .
negative	my house does not have a number , only a name and i was supposed to receive an_email of which i should have replied confirming the lack of a number .
negative	i didn_'_t receive this .
negative	i have never come_across this problem before with other internet companies .
negative	may be the ordering system needs changing to prevent this happening .
negative	other than that , as long as i receive the item shortly , i do not have any complaints as yet !
negative	i have been told by my bank in australia the your company and the merchant charges people numerous_times for the same booking .
negative	i was charged 00times on 0 credit_card and 0 on my other .
negative	all cards got blocked .
negative	i order the correct part , they acknowledged the correct part and sent the wrong one .
negative	to get the right part i have to pay to return it .
negative	i paid the shipping on the wrong part already and i sure they will charge me for freight when they send me the correct part .
negative	i '_ve been trying to return a conductor plate for about two_weeks now .
negative	i opened up a trouble ticket i feel_like i '_m going no where fast , i sent them pics of the part in it '_s full integrity asked for an_rma_number and their response was " what are you asking for "
negative	no quality and complete disregard for the goods they ship .
negative	the drivers are of no help and could care less , as long as they get your signature .
negative	i will always use fedex
negative	order from partsgeek !
negative	alternator went out and i ordered a new one via partsgeek .
negative	0 week_later i received the alternator with a cracked housing .
negative	not sure how a new unit with a cracked housing gets through customer service but it did !!
negative	i immediately attempted contact via ph and they never answered .
negative	finally on sat .
negative	i reached an answering service and was told to fill_out a form and email and w_/ in 00_hrs they will respond .
negative	so tues . morning i get a response w_/ an_rma_number to return saying they are sorry .
negative	this can '_t happen when you need a vehicle to get around and another delay of 0 week or so is out of question .
negative	purchased another alternator locally and will attempt to return for full_refund !
negative	i wanted to renew insurance for 0 ipads belonging to my employer .
negative	your on - line system was unable to cope with my need to pay the annual_fee_upfront , not by standing order .
negative	your team refused to talk to me by phone until i yelled out my date of birth , at a volume that was heard by my entire office .
negative	you have not answered my email about whether this insurance would affect my person claims record , if a claim was made by my company .
negative	instead you have bombarded me with ' no - reply ' ' reminders .
negative	due to shortage of time , i have renewed my policy for 0 ipads but not the 0 my company bought more recently , so i have a year to find a more customer - focused insurer .
negative	worse service ever .
negative	no customer service , no shipping return_label , and start counting the days left from the day you rent the book online and not when it gets to your house 0 days_later .
negative	had a lot of frustration with returning the book .
negative	made my reservation with travelocity for a package to include hotel and flight .
negative	have never had a problem before .
negative	called the hotel to add a meal plan .
negative	they said we had to go through travelocity to do this .
negative	called travelocity and had to wait for a call back due to delay on the phone .
negative	told them that we needed to book the meal plan through them as per disney .
negative	hard to believe that no one else would have never had this problem , but no one knew what we were talking_about .
negative	they said they caledl disney but that i would have to call back again the next_day because of the reservation area was closed .
negative	did not give me a direct line to call back .
negative	called back next_day , on hold for over one and half hours .
negative	anyone i spoke with said they could not help me with adding a meal plan .
negative	would certainly not recommend doing disney through travelocity .
negative	additionally , don_'_t know what kind of deal they now have with expedia but customer service has decreased greatly from what i was used to with travelocity .
negative	it has_been one week since i have returned from my trip .
negative	a trip i had to create once i arrived , since the reservation was not provided to me in an area with limited to no availability .
negative	i was provided a case number e_- 0000000 .
negative	to date i have spent over 0 . 0 hours on the phone with travelocity .
negative	most of which has_been on hold .
negative	no resolution .
negative	no empathy .
negative	not reimbursement , and zero customer service .
negative	i cannot_believe the manner in which this was handled and expect a return phone_call from a supervisor that can resolve the issue fully .
negative	without transferring me .
negative	without putting me on hold , and without apologizing , but providing action for resolution .
negative	i have a life and it does not include endless hours trying to reach a competent person within travelocity to resolve your mistake .
negative	not mine .
negative	again .
negative	this is unacceptable and i will be finished with the company moving_forward , as it has always been my first choice in vacations , but several recent incidents are forcing me to look_elsewhere , regardless of price .
negative	i cannot_afford to deal with such poor customer service as a so - called vip member since 0000 .
negative	i can be reached from 000am - 000pm monday through friday on this number .
negative	why fly with them ??
negative	?
negative	they only contact you when it suits them notwhen you have a problem about the item , very very dissopointed with this firm . will not deal again with them . dr j l jones
negative	you shipped us the wrong parts and it took_forever to get a return_authorization so we can return them .
negative	now you ' re charging us $_00 . 00 ( 00_%) for restocking .
negative	we need this money refunded asap on invoice_# 00 - 0000000 .
negative	this is not our fault therefore , we should not be charged .
negative	not helpful at all when called to get help in booking the extra night .
negative	we saw they had us checking out a night early and wanted to correct this error !
negative	it was absolutely ridiculous !!
negative	!
negative	sorry but i do not receive my order since 0 months ( n ° 000 000 000 )
negative	the number of the post was given but nothing happens about it .
negative	( gm000000000000000000 ).
negative	for the first time i can not recommend or evaluate positively .
negative	thanks for the opportunity to report ,
negative	why did you cancel the order repeatedly , and then give us ridiculous hours to call to fix whatever problem there was ?
negative	absolutely dreadful service .
negative	my order never came !
negative	i am trying to contact someone to solve my problem and no one cares !
negative	no one in deepblue gives me a solucion !
negative	i want my order or a refund now !
negative	ordered the part on august_00th and payment was taken out of my account the same day .
negative	after questioning the order i was told i would be contacted by a representative within 00 to 00_hrs .
negative	didn_'_t get the phone_call didn_'_t get the information i wanted didn_'_t get any response except 00 e_-_mails to let_me know someone would be contacting me .
negative	didn_'_t happen .
negative	this was the first time to order on line and to say it was unpleasant doesn_'_t quite cover it .
negative	they quoted me a certain price match and when i got the receipt it was the total price was way higher_than the quoted price per_night .
negative	i will never use them again untrustworthy .. they take your money right_away but the refund may take up to 00 days .
negative	purchased kitched faucet and found that no hot / cold options .
negative	return procedures very confusing online and no answer from customer service .
negative	put on hold and disconnected repeatedly .
negative	returned item 0_weeks_ago , no email or refund to date .
negative	no proper information on how to reach english_speaking help - the ones that claimed to speak it - cannot
negative	worst airline service ever_dealt_with - aeroflot is a luxury compared to this service
negative	the new travelocity website is certainly not an improvement over the previous version .
negative	it is no_longer intuitive and is slow .
negative	i could not complete a reservation over the weekend due to site issues .
negative	this is making me look at alternative sites
negative	#_00000000 #_00000000 horrible !
negative	placed two orders of flowers a week before it was due , canceled one order day after issued me a refund but two_weeks_later im still_waiting for it , kept the second order , sent flowers internationaly , got sent a confirm email_saying my flowers were delivered , in fact my girl_friend never got the flowers ! i had to email floraqueen to find out what happened , florist car wasnt working and didnt deliever the flowers , and didnt try to redeliever them later or following_day , floraqueen " issued a refund " yea its been over two_weeks still_havent got my money back , what a scam this place should of used 0000flowers instead , lost $_000 in total , it would of been nice to say hey we messed_up big time we are going to redeliever flowers to your girlfriend on us , and we will give you a refund , or hey just redeliever any flowers !
negative	!
negative	its a piece of junk !!!!!!!!!!
negative	it does not work
negative	hello ,
negative	on wednesday 0th_november i visited chester le street branch as i was booked in for an mot and full service .
negative	i have used this branch in the past and haven_'_t had reason to complain before .
negative	i was greeted_by ' danny ' and left the car ( mk 0 focus ) with him .
negative	during the day he phoned twice detailing the various problems including front and back brakes and pads , fault code on engine , tracking , scoff on rear_wheel_bearings and a host of others .
negative	i was told it would cost about £_000 - money i didn_'_t have .
negative	in the end i settled on a new headlamp cover and wiper_blade .
negative	all that was needed for an mot pass .
negative	the headlamp cover cost me £_000 and i know from my own experience that these cost about £_00 .
negative	the job also only involves the removal of 0 screws , about 00_minutes work at most .
negative	that means that mark up and labour costs were £_000 ( or £_000 per hour ) far too high !
negative	i was told that he would ring around_0pm to pick the car up .
negative	at 0 : 00 i hadn_'_t received a call and phoned them to say i was on my way .
negative	when i picked the car up there was a grease stain on the passenger_seat and a fuse box cover was left in the footwell .
negative	also the leather bag under the handbrake was left loose .
negative	the official mot form only listed a rear tyre near legal limit , a suspension arm with a deteriorated rubber bush and an anti roll bar linkage as advisory items .
negative	not the 00 items on the handwritten service report ...
negative	when i drove home , the car was surging and juddering and lacking power when accelerating .
negative	it was virtually un - drivable and kept threatening to stall , this persisted .
negative	i returned to the branch at 0 : 00 the next_morning and was greeted_by a man who i assumed to be the operations_manager unlocking the shutters .
negative	i was annoyed and stressed but polite when i told_him about the engine problem ( i chose not to worry_about the other trivial matters which i had put right myself ) he argued with me and spoke over me and told me excuses , including " it was like that when it arrived " " it '_s due to low fuel when you brought the car in " " it '_s a problem with the head_gasket " in the end , after a test_drive , he agreed to look at the car .
negative	it was concluded that one of the spark_plug leads had been damaged in the service .
negative	he said he would change those and ring me in an_hour .
negative	two hours_later , after_hearing nothing , i phoned him and he said he was about to take it out for a road test and would call in ten_minutes .
negative	he didn_'_t ring and i made my way to the branch .
negative	the car was ready and the fault had been a lead damaged by the mechanic and a faulty spark_plug which was put in .
negative	no apology was offered .
negative	i found myself totally disgusted with the whole_experience .
negative	shoddy service , including me having to make the phone_calls .
negative	being told i was wrong repeatedly ( i know that the car was okay when i drove it in ) ridiculous prices .
negative	attempts made by staff to pay for more work , which probably isn_'_t necessary and an overall lack of care and respect .
negative	i won_'_t be using the service again ...
negative	i ordered a upper radiator_fan_shroud and recieved a lower , the upper is part of the radiator support , the part i recieved has no provisions to support the radiator .
negative	i was sent the wrong fog_light ass ., i then proceded to send a message that there was no bill of lading in the box . the only_thing in the box was the wrong fog_lamps and they did not have the bill in the box .
negative	that way i could have the paper_work in front of me so i could at_least have some way of communicate with some one .
negative	the box did not have any thing to keep the lghts from being tossed back and forth in the box . the worst part was i sent a email to customer service to get this resolved and i still have not heard back from them . that was on 0 - 00 - 0000 know one has yet to respond so i would at_least appreciate some sort of communication befor i cancel the credit_card transactioin .
negative	thank_you ,

negative	expedia is the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
negative	after the flight was cancelled and moved two_days ahead , spent four hours waiting on phone ( website gives a phone # to cancel ) on the first day , finally on the second day got hold of a real_person_who was very hard to understand .
negative	they notified me of the cancelled flight by email .
negative	tried to cancel hotel & car the first day was told it had to be done by expedia .
negative	the total trip was charged to credit_card the day of booking .
negative	still_waiting for removal , will have to file dispute through the credit_card company .
negative	expedia finally took partial payment off credit_card , still_waiting for air_fare to be credited .
negative	i have sent multiple emails , and they will not respond .
negative	not one word .
negative	order was fulfilled as_promised , and quickly .
negative	slow delivery although there was a bad ice_storm so i will give them the benefit of the doubt .
negative	i filled_out a complaint ticket and this is day two without a call or email , though i am still within the 00 hour grace_period so again ...
negative	benefit of the doubt .
negative	i paid for expensive shipping to receive the completely wrong part which is delaying the work on my car further .
negative	i have ordered from printerinks on numerous occaissions in the pastand received the ink 0 or 0 days_later .
negative	however on this occaission 0 days after oredering from them i have yet to receive my order .
negative	i havent received anything !!!!
negative	i am still_waiting
negative	still never received my shipment .
negative	it '_s been 0_weeks since i '_ve ordered everything .
negative	ordered 0 - 00 # bags of dog_food & 0 cases of can dog_food .
negative	received the 0 bags on time , but the can food never arrived as scheduled .
negative	called , they said it would arrive the next_day .
negative	never arrived .
negative	called again , they had to reorder the food .
negative	delivery day came and went , called up chewy again , they said it '_ll arrive the next_day - it finally arrived .
negative	i '_ll stick with my old supplier .
negative	i ordered trunk_struts for my 0000_mercedes sl 000 on february 00 , 0000 .
negative	i received a notice that they were paid for on february 00 , 0000 .
negative	it is now march 0 , 0000 and i still am waiting for them to arrive .
negative	i sent a message to parts_geek and received one text which basically told me that they put a tracer on my package which can take between 0 - 0 days .
negative	once this step is done a claim will be filed which will take 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	in the meantime , i am without the parts i paid for over two_weeks_ago .
negative	i am not very happy with parts_geek '_s response or their lack of help .
negative	i realize that the problem lies with fed_ex , but parts_geek '_s lack of help is disappointing to say the least .
negative	i have booked a flight from brisbane from singapore .
negative	i have actually read my itinerary before i confirmed it and gave my credit_card details .
negative	somehow , it turned_out to have switched around to become travelling from singapore to brisbane for a return trip .
negative	i have tried seeking for a resolution and to fix my ticket up .
negative	my ticket is now
negative	0 . pending for change
negative	0 . i have to pay the difference in whatever ticket is available
negative	0 . i have to miss an important occasion
negative	0 . i still have to pay for the costs of change and an another issuance fee

negative	buyer_beware !!!
negative	how nissan of chesapeake got away with charging me $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) above the sticker price of a 0000_nissan_altima s !!!
negative	i received a card in the mail from noc telling_me i owned a 0000_chrysler 000lx & that my monthly_payments were just $_000 . 00 a month .
negative	they said they would offer 0 refinance existing loan 0 cheaper interest_rate or trade in my car offering me 00_% more then it was worth , pay off the loan , & give me a deal i could not resist on purchasing a brand_new car from them !!!
negative	i called them & made an_appointment 0 may 00 , 0000 !!!
negative	the sales_team act as though they are trying their best 0 help u or become your friends when in fact what they are really doing is 0 get u 0 drop your guard down so they can become your worst_enemy & get as much money out of u as possible !!!
negative	here is how they conned me in0 signing a binding contract paying $_000 . 00 more each month 0 the next 00 months 0 a car i did not want !!!
negative	initially i was not even looking 0 a brand_new car 0 purchase but a used truck with a 0 cylinder engine since the car i owned had a v - 0 which used 0 much gas !!!
negative	it did not take long 0 discover nissan does not even make a truck with a 0 cylinder engine !!!
negative	then i was told i could only receive special financing interest_rates & vehicle incentive discounts if i purchased a brand_new vehicle such as the altima !!!
negative	i was shown what part of their lot 0 look then i discovered all the colors were mostly white & black but there was 0 that stood_out & it was fully_loaded with all the bells & whistles so that '_s the 0 i chose 0 test_drive !!!
negative	i was shocked 0 discover how this smaller vehicle them my full size chrysler_000 was easier 0 handle & had a more comfortable ride plus all the extras 0 many 0 mention here !!!
negative	the sticker price was $_00k so i was quickly told there was no way i would ever be able 0 afford monthly_payments !!!
negative	since they knew i was now hooked on the exspensive nissan_altima all i had 0 do was find a cheaper model that i could_afford monthly_payments !!!
negative	we had 0 leave the dealership & drive 0 another crammed lot full of vehicles in order 0 find an altima with the color i liked !!!
negative	i found a red altima that only had hub_caps no custom rims & the list price was $_00k !!!
negative	i dealth with a salesman & his manager who both kept insuring me how they would be getting me the deal of a lifetime !!!
negative	the manager said he got me 0 . 0 % financing which was far better then what i had on the chrysler_000 when i purchased that for 0 . 0 % !!!
negative	he then said the payments would be $_000 . 00 a month never mentioning 0 how long !!!
negative	i told_him that was 0 high so he said he could ' nt get them lowered unless i put some money down !!!
negative	i told them i needed monthly_payments below $_000 . 00 each month so he tried hitting me up for $ 0 grand down which i said i could ' nt afford !!!
negative	he then asked how much i could_afford & they would simply hold my check until the funds were there !!!
negative	these_guys are masters @ manipulation , coersion , & wearing u down until u give in !!!
negative	i told them earlier i was diabetic & had not had anything 0 eat 0 a few hours so my blood sugar was low so i guess they knew they could take_advantage of me !!!
negative	my initial appointment was @ 0 :_00pm & this was now several hours_later around 0 - 0pm !!!
negative	i told them i could_afford $_000 . 00 check but it would not be good 0 @ least 0 more weeks !!!
negative	the payments were ' nt reduced under $_000 . 00 but remained @ $_000 . 00 a month !!!
negative	no figures were ever discussed or seen during the entire negotiation !!!
negative	i told them i had just been offered $_00k ( 00 , 000 . 00 ) alread 0 a trade in on my 0000_chrysler_000 from the exact_same dealarship i bought it from less then a year & half ago !!!
negative	the car did not have 0 scratch or dent on it & was in better shape now then it was when i bought it & i had not even put 00k ( 00 , 000 ) miles on it !!!
negative	the pay off amount was $_00k so i knew i would only have 0 make up for $_0k difference which would be then added 0 the price of the altima !!!
negative	the card i received in the mail from noc also had a check for $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) that could be used 0wards the purchase of a new car or used 0 lower the sticker price so i thought i was set !!!
negative	by the time i finally got 0 the finance office my blood sugar was so low i just signed every paper thrown in front of me & said yes 0 everything just 0 try 0 get the hell out of there as soon as i could so i could get something 0 eat !!!
negative	i never left the dealarship until almost dark outside which was @ least 0 - 0 hours after i 0st arrived there !!!
negative	nissan only offers a 0 year_warranty on their new vehicles so i hurriedly agreed 0 an_additional 0 yrs . extended_warranty which raised the monthly car payments back up to $_000 . 00 for the next 00 months !!!
negative	gap insurance was also thrown in there somewhere !!!
negative	again no figures or prices were ever disclosed b0 or @ the signing of the contract other then only the monthly_payment amount !!!
negative	i can not tell u just how sick i was 0 days_later after i left nissan of chesapeake & discovered just how much & bad they had screwed me !!!
negative	they only allowed_me $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) trade in value on the chrysler_000 which is the rock_bottom price allowed 0 a rough trade in not a prestige trade in like i gave them !!!
negative	this automatically put me owing the payoff amount of my chrysler_000 $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) instead of just $ 0000 . 00 if tghey had given me the amount that my car was worth !!!
negative	so now noc can add the difference 0 the price of the nissan !!!
negative	they also charged me $_0k ($ 0 , 000 . 00 ) 0 the extended_warranty which is added 0 the sticker price of the new car !!!
negative	i was never given any so called incentives or discounts as told earlier & no $ 0 , 000 . 00 credit or discount was ever allowed or taken_away from the sticker price either !!!
negative	i guess that $_0k check written out 0 me that was included in the card they mailed 0 my home bounced !!!
negative	the only_thing nos did do was allow me 0 . 0 % interest_rate on financing only because they wanted 0 charge me $ 0 , 000 . 00 more then the sticker price of the vehicle !!!
negative	they have absolutely nothing 0 lose & everything 0 gain by cheating u by getting u 0 sign a binding contract that if u default on the financer just simply repossess your vehicle & u still owe the balance of the loan !!!
negative	i just want the public 0 be aware of nissan of chesapeake & how they will screw u if u only give them the chance or opportunity 0 !!
negative	!
negative	after_contacting square_trade numerous_times concerning my 0nd claim with them i was finally issued a full_refund via overnight fed_ex delivery within 00_hours of my last & final phone conversatioin !!!

negative	# 000000000000 .
negative	the delivery date will be today .
negative	i apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you .
negative	if you have any questions , please_let_me know .
negative	thank_you ,

negative	re : ticket [# 0000000000 ]
negative	i had a pretty poor experience with customer_services after my delivery did not arrive .
negative	having never used sunglasses shop before i was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that my delivery had gone missing in the post , but after several emails back and forth to their customer_services team , they were unwilling to even investigate , let_alone refund my money , until a set period of time had passed .
negative	i had ordered the sunglasses for a holiday a month away , which i ' d thought would be plenty of time for them to arrive .
negative	i even paid for first_class delivery .
negative	however , when they did not arrive , i was told i ' d need to wait a month before they could run an investigative trace with royal_mail .
negative	they would not entertain the idea of refunding me until this trace took place .
negative	as such , although i gave myself plenty of time for the sunglasses to arrive before my holiday , i was left without them a month later , and without the money i ' d spent in the first place .
negative	i ended_up having to buy another pair from a different company entirely when i got to the airport .
negative	i won_'_t be using sunglasses shop again .
negative	i ordered 0 mirrors for my pickup_truck and received real soon .
negative	but on was packed with lots of packing around it an it was ok .
negative	the second package came and there was not any packing and the mirror was broken ( detached from the housing ) now the company says no return , no refund or large refund charges , large percentage for restocking .
negative	i am sorry but i am the consumer and i am at a lost , company should take_pride in packaging with some type of responsibility .
negative	romeo e barriere
negative	its twelve days now since i ordered three items of work wear , i just live twelve miles from hunt_office and they still_havent received my order , im sorry i said i give them a try , ill be going back to my old suppliers from now on .
negative	contacted your coustomer service twice to find out why my order has not been filled , my order # aren_'_t valad my purchase # aren_'_t valad .
negative	but you took my money and did not fill my order , two o_rings were delivered a week apart , but nobody seems to know where my pump seals are ?
negative	it has_been 00 days since i ordered the parts where are they , in the mean time i cannot add chemicals and my pool is going to hell in this hot_weather .
negative	i wouldn_'_t buy anything from partsgeek if i were you , i got broken parts and they charged me to exchange them .
negative	the worst customer service ever sent emails unansered called no anser on any line left_messages no responce 00 days still whating for parts never again
negative	got address_label , they took my money but sent no barcode label & wouldn_'_t reply to my query as to where it was !!
negative	money & postage day lost !!
negative	how can i expect client to believe their incompetence ??
negative	?
negative	i placed an order on may 0st .
negative	may_00th i learned through fedex that the package was damaged and undeliverable and to contact the supplier for more information , which i did .
negative	may 00st healthdesigns replied to my email_saying they had not been informed of this until they received my email .
negative	they then told me that the item was now out of stock and once received they would ship it to me .
negative	on may 00rd i replied and asked how long the delay would be as i may want to just cancel the order .
negative	they replied that the package was still in transit to arrive to healthdesigns and once they received it i would be given a full_refund .
negative	it is now the 0th of june and i '_ve not received a refund nor have they contacted me again .
negative	poor parts delivery .
negative	received one .
negative	order two .
negative	charged my card for two but sent one .
negative	wait on phone 00 min .
negative	answered then hang_up .
negative	why spend money on phone service if you don_'_t answer .
negative	no service .
negative	matt said parts are on there way a . s . a . p .
negative	0 week no tracking_#.
negative	will not order from again .
negative	i purchased a 00 , 000_btu package .
negative	when i received the units , i realized that the outdoor unit was only 00 , 000_btu .
negative	i am not sure why they would package 00 , 000_btu indoor units with a 00 , 000_btu condenser , very misleading .
negative	when i spoke to customer service their answer was to ship at my cost ( over $_000 ) and they would send over 00 , 000_btu condenser .
negative	terrible customer_support and received no apology for their false_advertising / packaging .
negative	you can '_t not get anyone in customer service to speak with without hours on the phone and if your lucky to get someone .
negative	ordered part sent to wrong_address and new part was defective after installing this part still no help from parts_greek since before the holidays .
negative	bought a microphone from tidal savings 00 days ago .
negative	it was supposedly shipped usps_priority_mail from ca .
negative	nothing yet .
negative	no tracking provided .
negative	i joined with them , i sell discount netflix accounts .
negative	i had 0 sales in 0 days , but one of them did a chargeback because the order the wrong plan .
negative	the customer then purchased the correct plan , so all was good .
negative	i just got a notice from them that i '_m a high risk , and my monies will be put into a reserve for 00 days .
negative	mind you , at this time , i had a pending withdrawal that was to go into my account , but even now that says it failed .
negative	sad thing is , i read these reviews before joining , i went with their bbb score instead , which is an a . i should have gone with my gut_feeling .
negative	what they ' re doing is earning interest of my monies that i earned .
negative	i emailed back that i want my money now , and that i will be seeking legal counsel based on my experience , along with all the reviews on this site .
negative	if you ' re reading this before you '_ve dealt_with them , run !
negative	don_'_t give them a chance , you '_ll get ripped_off .
negative	the few positive feedbacks you will find on this thread i '_m sure was fabricated by wepay employees .
negative	so i actually haven_'_t even received the phone i ordered yet , but i assume they cancelled my order because when i checked my balance for my debit_card , it went from 0 $( the amount i had after i ordered my phone ) to 000 $( the amount i had before i ordered my phone ).
negative	with this in mind , i assumed they cancelled my order without_any notice .
negative	also this was the second time i ordered from them , as they did send me a notice when my first order was cancelled .
negative	absolutely not satisfied and completely frustrated .
negative	it has_been past a full week since i placed the order .
negative	this company somehow does a very convincing job of making it look like the reservation you ' re setting_up is with the hotel themselves -- i '_ve talked with other people that had no_idea they were even using this company '_s services .
negative	then they precharge your credit_card for a hotel reservation ( something that should never happen ), and add about $_00 on top of everything for their fee .
negative	they gurentee deliver and don_'_t deliver
negative	we booked our flight tickets to usa with bravofly .
negative	me and my wife didn_'_t know when we could return to sweden .
negative	so before we booked our tickets we called bravofly and asked if we could change the date on return ticket and they said yes .
negative	when i was going to change the date on our return ticket bravofly said i couldn_'_t and that it was not their responsebility .
negative	and even_though i explained the situation the customer service said i could not prove anything and basically that me and my wife was lying .
negative	we had to buy new tickets and were not offered any kind of refound .
negative	we willl never book our flight tickets with bravofly again !
negative	i used this company to book a premier_inn but did not receive the reduced rate .
negative	when asked why the company set me off to get the evidence of the reduced price so that they could match it .
negative	when i produced the documentary evidence they came up with reasons not to if they had said tough in the first place i could have cancelled and rebooked direct with premier_inn .
negative	the delay meant i missed the offer .
negative	i would not recommend them at all .
negative	delivery service is atrocious .
negative	flowers average at best .
negative	i returned a book where i paid to have the book shipped to them .
negative	they deducted the shipping cost , which i already paid , from my refund .
negative	they used to respond in a timely_fashion , within 00_hours , but they no_longer do this .
negative	it also takes multiple emails before a single response is made during the course of a week .
negative	they also used to have an online_chat_feature on their website , but they have
negative	removed that .
negative	my mechanic said the part you sent me is defective and worse than the old one i had .
negative	i will be contacting you very soon .
negative	part was a idle control_valve .
negative	disgruntled customer
negative	we had booked our hire car for a 0000hrs pickup .
negative	at no time were we informed that the office would close shortly_after that time if we hadn_'_t arrived to collect the vehicle .
negative	we eventually arrived at the hire car collection_point at 0000hrs .
negative	most of the other hire car companies were still open and we were informed that locauto had closed at 0000hrs .
negative	again i reiterate , at no time were we informed that the office was not 00hours !
negative	as we were a party of 0 we then had to pay for 0 taxis to take us to our accommodation at pistoia at a total_cost of 000_euros .
negative	i phoned and emailed rentalcars . com only to be told they could do nothing and that i should have put my flt no .
negative	this was unknown to me at the time of booking the rental_car .
negative	in the morning i returned to the airport where i met a very helpful locauto representative who was able to provide me with my hire car .
negative	he also checked the confirmation voucher and confirmed that at no time was it mentioned that the office was not manned 00_hours .
negative	he informed me that rentalcars . com are aware of this .
negative	this is a major faux pas by rentalcars . com as it cost our party an_additional 000_euros for taxis .
negative	additionally , when i contacted them both by phone and email they were very unhelpful .
negative	the only saving_grace was the rep at locauto .
negative	the return of the vehicle was slick and very professional by locauto .
negative	united_airlines delayed our flights for hours without explanation .
negative	the people in the terminal in chicago were useless .
negative	i will never fly united again .
negative	checkout would not let_me order with free shipping although it was clearly an option available .
negative	i would like my $ 0 . 00 refunded !!!
negative	!
negative	do to you shipping the wrong part and want me to pay to ship it back .
negative	i will never buy anything from you !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered three items one month_ago and still have not received them !!!
negative	two of them were meant to be christmas_presents ... i contacted customer_support and they could not tell me where my order is , they have said they would look into it - they should have been able to track the order right_away , why was there no tracking_info ?
negative	where the hell is my order ??
negative	?
negative	a part was missing from my order .
negative	i will need to return the purchase if the missing part is not shipped .
negative	i ordered rotors for a mercedes .
negative	partsgeek shipped rotors for a ford .
negative	now i have to pay to ship the 00 pound rotors back and may not get a full_refund .
negative	used them for a 0 week booking from madrid_airport .
negative	their chosen local partner was firefly car_hire .
negative	not a good experience :
negative	0 .
negative	even_though we arrived on time , we had to wait 00_mins to be seen then 0 and a half hours before a car was ready , all in a very hot office in the car_park with aircon for staff only !
negative	0 .
negative	our car was not ready , but in the 0 + hours we had to wait , i watched 0 members of their staff sitting in one of the cars smoking and chatting whilst 0 were left in the office to deal with all customers .
negative	could these 0 not have been cleaning cars or at_least trying to help .
negative	0 .
negative	were ripped_off for a tank of fuel at double what t cost me to fill the tank at a local petrol_station .
negative	0 .
negative	were ripped_off with additional insurance because the " fully_insured " offering from holiday_autos did not cover windscreen , wheels or tyres .
negative	0 .
negative	car was a dented , dirty and not up to normal car_hire standards .
negative	0 .
negative	car itself was poor quality and not well serviced , struggled to keep_up with the speed limits on even slight inclines on the motorway .
negative	my advice , stick with one of the big companies like avis , hertz , europcar , sixt etc .
negative	it may look more_expensive , but in the long run it won_'_t be and you will get a much more suitable and safe rental_car .
negative	i recently confirmed the phone_power web_site is not playing messages properly and overwriting messages .
negative	this may result in un - heard messages being deleted .
negative	the phone_power support staff confirmed this on the ms internet_explorer .
negative	they claimed it worked on other internet browsers and requested i install a different browser .
negative	this is a critical issue which results in lost messages .
negative	if this is not fixed quickly , then i will cancel my subscription and request a refund .
negative	i ordered a $_000 . 00 + steering gear box i got a massage part is on hold because they said my card didn_'_t go though but the money was showing pending in my account 0st they said they had the wrong_address but it was right i sent in a ticket to them 0 times and finely canceled the order because it was just taking to long tried to call customer service but could never get though wait on hold for over 00_minutes than you all hang_up every time not only did i wast my time my truck was down 0_weeks longer as i shopped_around for the part very disappointed :(
negative	received product almost 0 week after originally promised , was a christmas_gift , and even after repeatedly asking when the controller would be ready i was assured i would receive the monday before_christmas .
negative	after not receiving it that day i was told it would go out the day after christmas .
negative	i was mislead and ignored for a very long time and and a child did not get a gift for christmas .
negative	i could understand if it was a $_00 item , but it being over $_000 you would think they would provide customer service .
negative	they do not .
negative	each and every time you call you get voicemail to leave a message .
negative	i never received a call back , only an_email days_later .
negative	i will not buy form this company again and i cannot in good conscious recommend to anyone .
negative	this vendor did not refund for parts returned , was / is inresponsive to any form of attempted communication , email , telephone , and fax .
negative	waited for months for refund , 0 months = no response ,
negative	forget the price or promises , you will wish you stayed away .
negative	google them and see their reviews for yourself !
negative	!
negative	order are good but try to call in for ?
negative	sucks iv stayed on phone for 00 min nobody .
negative	you don_'_t send the hotel address to the email or the confirmation number ,
negative	was very difficult , to find the hotel address , and your customer service , put me in hold for ever , never answered was my worz booking experience ever ,
negative	my comments as above .
negative	the excuse that i had been shown in fine_print is not good enough - i was not clearly made aware of an extra_charge when i arrived without having to read pages of fine_print , and i do not trust auto_europe anymore .
negative	i called all week long and got no answers .
negative	these_people must think they can joke around with peoples money .
negative	they said the process takes about 0 - 0 business days but my controller has_been getting painted for 0 days .
negative	i would not recommend this place to know one .
negative	if you want a controller find a new place .
negative	they are liars and they have no truth in them .
negative	i hope the would reply to them or i will send them 00 more emails and maybe they will reply
negative	i received my product packaged poorly .
negative	it was a lower engine_cover that was bent in half to fit a shipping box which caused the cover to break at the folded point .
negative	i was issued a bad number for an xbox_live_gold_card and they are telling_me
negative	the number is good \.
negative	i am not sure if i was the only one issued this number why is microsoft telling_me it is already used .
negative	this company does not have a good way to contact them after working hours this is when most problems would normally arise so why not have someone available to take_care of problems to a better hour maybe 0pm eastern time
negative	never in my life have i been treated worse by a company .
negative	when i type this quick story it wont seem true but it is .
negative	they " limited " my account , which means make it so you can use it , cant take money , cant mail things , cant contact buyer , cant get payment .
negative	they did this because " i was selling my dvds too cheap " thats honestly the reason they gave_me .
negative	they clsoed my account 0_weeks before_christmas to maximize damage .
negative	then never responded to my emails , or calls for 0_weeks .
negative	then after christmas told me this horrible excuse , i asked if a customer complained about ym products they said " no , we think your selling too cheap ".
negative	i have % 000 positive_feedback on ebay , think we all know how imposibly that is to do now adays .
negative	they told me the 00 steps to follow and prove i '_m selling legit dvds , withing 0 hour i sent them 00 + pages of proof , they promptly emailed me a cookie cutter email_saying denied .
negative	not wont reply to calls , emails , nothing , they are keeping my money that i had in my account and will not give it back " host to god !"
negative	my money , " same thing as them coming to your house , taking money from your pocket and not giving it back " its theft !!
negative	!
negative	if you paid me to use paypal i would not , google checkout is already taking their business fast .
negative	i bag anyone reading this to keep your paypal balance at sero and close your account , i am free to answer any questions you might have
negative	grindhouseguy00 @_yahoo . com
negative	if someone from paypal sees this and wants to make it rite " like that '_ll happen " email me anytime , i dare ya
negative	they only got 0_star cause i cant give - 0
negative	they screwed me out of £_000 !
negative	made a payment that was not authorised , have not repaid .
negative	company will not price match / beat by 0 %.
negative	they will take your order and indicate they will beat the price , but they later alter your order amount and claim some bs that the other company has ' artificial ' shipping_charges .
negative	sorry , i have no time for these games , and they can keep their ' free energy bar incentive '.
negative	i don_'_t see any point in purchasing through bravofly .
negative	you can just book directly from the airline after searching with bravofly .
negative	their fee was outrageous .
negative	the only reason i did it was that wizzair '_s site was down and i had one day to book .
negative	i bought a shower door from victoria_plumb back in february .
negative	the ordering and shipping side of things is fine , worthy of a five_star .
negative	however , once the door had been installed it was immediately clear it was unfit for purpose and so had to be removed .
negative	i contacted customer_services and sent an_email along with a short video_showing the problem with the item .
negative	i was told that my ' case ' would be passed to their technical team for investigation .
negative	having not heard_anything for a few weeks i called vp to see how things were progressing .
negative	by the way , phoning vp is not an easy matter - you '_ll be left on hold for ages being told by the recorded_message that your call is important to them but yet they do little to improve things , each time i '_ve phoned it has_been a long_winded process .
negative	emails just get the usual " we are dealing_with it " response or disappear into the ether and simply go unanswered .
negative	i managed to speak to leanne who assured me ( via her manager ) a refund would be processed as soon as possible .
negative	this was about a month_ago now and i '_m still_waiting .
negative	in summary , if you want to buy bathroom products you can buy from vp and you might be lucky but if you need to return anything or obtain a refund you will be left high and dry .
negative	what do they say ?
negative	caveat_emptor ....... let the buyer_beware !
negative	ordered the bag 0 days before flying .
negative	called the day before to be told it hadn_'_t even left the manufacturer to get to bagsdirect .
negative	won_'_t be using again .
negative	when it comes down to it ..
negative	if an offer for a $_00 dollar coupon saving is offered .. but later denied at the checkout point .. one has to question the integrity of service here ..
negative	unless they mean to offer me a rebate of $_00 dollars .. for that reason i would not suggest this site to anyone .. unless this is rectified .. and if this is resolved .. then i will happily tell countless others to shop_here instead of amazon and ebay ..
negative	as usual , the on - line , self - directed experience was great .
negative	i have used travelocity for all my airline travel for several_years , but this was my first experience with customer service .
negative	i made a round_trip flight for my wife to see her father in the hospital for surgery .
negative	i called travelocity to understand their flight change policy in case she had to stay longer and i needed to change the return flight .
negative	the person told me i could do this in a 00 hour_window , which was perfect and gave her time to get there and assess his health in the hospital .
negative	once she got there , he was not responding and it was clear that she needed more time as he was in critical condition .
negative	when i called to change her flight , after 00_minutes on hold i was told that their policy would not allow a change .
negative	there was nothing they could do , they asked me when she needed to return .
negative	i asked the agent to hold while i called my wife on my cell to find out , and after 00_minutes of me being on hold , the agent refused to go on hold for me .
negative	the situation was never resolved , my wife '_s father sadly passed_away during the trip and we lost the use of the return flight .
negative	if you think you made need customer service .
negative	do not use traveloctiy !
negative	this is not a company i would recommend to anyone after my visit yesterday .
negative	my daughter has an iphone 0 that had a broken screen , but everything else worked on the phone .
negative	the company states that they make repairs in four hours or less .
negative	we went by the office with about 00_minutes before the 0 hours were up , and they told us they needed 00 more minutes , that a sensor was not responding .
negative	we told them great , we will go to the grocery_store and return in about 00_minutes .
negative	when we returned to the store , with groceries in our car , we were told that the phone wasn_'_t ready yet .
negative	we waited and waited and waited .
negative	after around 00_minutes i asked the manager what was going on and he told me that they were still working on it .
negative	after another 00_minutes , we are told that this sensor didn_'_t recover , but it '_s not a big_deal .
negative	this sensor worked when we brought the phone in .
negative	over 0 hours after delivery , we get a still broken phone with no apologizes or offers to make it right .
negative	when we get home , we realize that the phone no_longer has the ability to connect with our wifi in all parts of the house , most_importantly , my daughters bed room .
negative	on a final note , i wish the manager showed half the interest or concern about my daughters phone not working correctly as he did show towards his new kiosk which was having technical difficulties which he spent the entire hour that we sat there working on it .
negative	horrible !
negative	!
negative	dualj charges for books upon_receipt of order .
negative	later they claim delays in finding merchandise .
negative	for 0 months now they have not returned my calls ( their call_center says it is under repair all the time - try it and see ) or my emails .
negative	have not received books .
negative	difficult to contest credit charge because they lead you on until it is too_late to contest at credit_card company .
negative	where did all these positive_reviews come from that are so generic and sound exactly the same ?
negative	booked online only to arrive and find the hotel was sold out hours before .
negative	as i pulled in i was not happy with what i saw hard and smelled .
negative	actually i should be happy there was no room .
negative	to make_matters worse the manger didn_'_t make any attempt to help me .
negative	by the time i realized there was no room available other hotels in the area had sold out .
negative	i wanted to show my girlfriend london but using the bus was a bad idea !
negative	the bus was stuck in traffic and was detoured !
negative	we spent nearly 0 hours and did not see much !
negative	i took my girlfriend and walked most of the central tour route much_quicker and saw more things .
negative	i wasted a lot of money and will never again use the bus_tour !
negative	to any other london visitors my advice is get a map and walk the tour !
negative	thomas
negative	not trustworthy fast shipping excellent product but shortly ( within two hours ) after using my debit_card to make a purchase it was apparently skimmed and used in the immediate area of the partsgeek warehouse .
negative	i hope they catxh the crooked employee who coppied my info ...
negative	what trip ?
negative	where do i supposedly go ?
negative	i didn_'_t book any trips recently .
negative	lousy lousy lousy lousy
negative	the first delivery was due on the 00 th never arrived after many emails they resent could only deliver 00th arrived could not get any one to accept that fact 00pounds wasted .
negative	never book flowers with this company there rubbish
negative	thanks have happy birthdays e . c . t but not with iflowers
negative	well , what can i say ??
negative	?
negative	ordered an xmas gift on the 0th dec , it is now the 00th and i still have not received my item .
negative	i have sent them 0 messages to find out what the delay is but no answer received .
negative	not happy
negative	j ' ai en toute confiance commandé un livre en pensant que_la photo correspondait à celui ci et me suis retrouvé avec_un autre !
negative	le titre est presque le même , mais la couverture et_le contenu pas du_tout . après réclamation il a été considéré que celle ci était injustifiée car il me fallait bien lire toute l ' annonce !
negative	ainsi il_est possible sur_ce site de mettre une photo attirante , se rapprochant de l ' objet à vendre , et de vendre un autre objet et cela le plus légalement du monde selon price minister ! heureusement que_la somme n ' était pas importante mais la raison a été donnée à quelqu ' un qui a en vente , tenez vous bien : plus de 0000 livres sur price minister !
negative	la raison du plus fort etc ...... si on le veut bien et si on l ' accepte , pour moi c ' est fini avec ce site .
negative	never get my order delivered but they got my money .
negative	while the actual service works well enough at times if you ' re buying , if you plan on selling a product and collect payment through paypal , don_'_t .
negative	you will more than likely encounter a situation where they will hold onto the money and you '_ll have to go through the biggest hassle to even attempt to get it back .
negative	and trust me , no one wants to go through the hassle that is paypal customer service .
negative	fact is , the customer service is horrendous .
negative	the call - in number is practically fully auto - mated and if your solution isn_'_t among those pre_- scripted , it will often go through a loop and you '_ll get no answers .
negative	you won_'_t even get transferred to a live representative a lot of times .
negative	when you do , they '' ll tell you that there '_s nothing they can do .
negative	thats on top of the fact that emailing them gets you nowhere as well .
negative	i recommend all boycott paypal .
negative	maybe they '_ll learn not to treat their customer base like sh_* t otherwise .
negative	messed_up our res
negative	never sent us the reference_number for thomas cook airlines and we spent many days and nights trying to resolve this issue .
negative	we had to have this number to obtain our airline_tickets .
negative	what a mess and alpharooms customer service was terrible .. they just kept passing the buck and we almost never got to go on our holiday because of their very poor customer service .
negative	once they get your money forget about any service or proper documentation at all .
negative	the worst ever ... never will use this company again .
negative	pablo recalde ,
negative	your reply to support request #_000000 has_been noted .
negative	a representative will follow - up with you as soon as possible .
negative	you will receive a response from us during normal business hours 0am - 0pm_est monday - friday .
negative	responses generally take between 00 - 00_hours from the time of the request .
negative	my part never came i keep writing to se if some one leasen
negative	so i bought a grill for my car and after a week i received a used damage grill and it wasnt even the right part
negative	and the grill had about 0 stickers from lkq which is a salvage_yard for cars and the stickers had different dates pretty sure this part has_been return more than twice
negative	well on the parts_geek website says im buyin a new grill not a broken used one
negative	very dissapointed
negative	i ordered kitchen roll and sauce pan set with free cutlery .
negative	the kitchen rolls turned_up after 0_weeks so badley damaged i couldn_'_t use them and i still_haven_'_t received the saucepans over 0 months later despite_repeated_emails sent to the useless customer service department .
negative	save your money and buy from a company that will deliver the goods .
negative	i have contacted customer_services at mighty_deals on numerous_occasions and they have not resolved the problem , the customer service side of mighty_deals is awful , i would not recommend them at all .
negative	was told it would arrive for christmas but i am still_waiting for it with no chance of it turning_up before_christmas because is still in denmark somewhere !
negative	chased up about it numerous_times and was told it will be with me for christmas !
negative	money has also been taken from my account for item but i dont have product
negative	the shipping took 0 days .
negative	i bought a winter jacket and some jeans .
negative	it came in a small box as i opened it i knew straight_away the quality of the clothing was poor .
negative	i looked on the tags it wasn_'_t even the right brand .
negative	it was a replica brand .
negative	i regret from buying from yesstyle .
negative	i wasted a lot of money buying cheap products thinking it was legit .
negative	i ordered a jacket which was then emailed to say it was out of stock .
negative	it took weeks to get a poor response saying that can no_longer fulfill my order , yet i was able to purchase the product direct from the supplier , albeit at a more_expensive cost .
negative	overall poor service and would now take my business elsewhere rather_than order from the outdoor_shop .
negative	i ordered headlight for 0000_honda , the inside bezel had a manufacturers flaw , a crack that looked like a seam .
negative	i am not going to waste my time sending part back and pay for shipping three_times , not conducive to business .
negative	this experience does not bode well with my continued patronage .
negative	too many other_companies out there with free shipping to even pay this any further mind .
negative	shame , i have ordered other parts in past in they were fine , but this leaves a bad_taste in my mouth , sorry , never again .
negative	thanks .
negative	when i receive the goods i may write a review .
negative	purchased two door_handles for my corolla ( one left , one right ).
negative	parts_geek shipped two right handles , one the wrong color .
negative	there '_s no way i could find to contact them other than their " return request " system on the web .
negative	cost to return was more than the cost of the part , so i will have to order another part from someone more reliable and reachable .
negative	i would not recommend parts_geek to anyone .
negative	you will probably find that your parcel has_been doorstepped , the reason for this is that this is the only way that the driver gets paid .
negative	pity amazon would like to know this .
negative	your parcel is in full view to the public , you may as well put up a sign saying steal me .
negative	there have been reports that a van is going around certain_areas picking_up doorstepped items ,
negative	as for people leaving notes on the door asking to leave the parcel in garage / shed again you may as well write steal me at the bottom of the note .
negative	pre_- ordered lego batman 0 at the end of may for 00nd june release , and is still processing and awaiting dispatch .
negative	showing as being in stock and dispatched within 00_hours , perhaps that should be days .
negative	this is not the first time this has happened , i have also had my fair share of mishaps with the hut .
negative	lack of customer service , lost / late parcels .
negative	they don ` t even offer you compensation for their mishaps .
negative	if you cannot cancel your order , they probably wont let you as they don_'_t want to lose some business .
negative	just delete your payment details .
negative	poor delivery service .... if things have been delayed by customs in the past then maybe wiggle should disclose that before costomers make purchase .
negative	no phone to contact wiggle .
negative	wasn_'_t even 00hrs and couldn_'_t cancel for a refund .
negative	apparently you can cancel but can '_t get your money back .
negative	so what '_s the point of having a cancellation_policy .
negative	horrible customer service .
negative	never will i ever use or recommend this service to anyone .
negative	i made a purchase through the website on february 0 , 0000 , the same day i received the email_confirmation of order and payment approval .
negative	but got no tracking_number 00 days and i '_m waiting for my package to arrive .
negative	i have tried six times to make contact by e_-_mail and contact us on the site with no response .
negative	then tried to contact steve by twitter , also did not get a solution to my problem .
negative	i would like to know the fate of my package .
negative	the value has already been paid and not yet received and not know where my package is .
negative	my order is 000f0ce0u0 .
negative	note_: previously i made another purchase and the package arrived in 00 days .
negative	i ordered parts for abs .
negative	brake system for a 0000 an a0000 trucks and received with out abs .
negative	an needed them because being broke_down .
negative	i will think_twice about using part geek again .
negative	upbowls @_gmail . com
negative	i think that parts_geek needs to return my money for shipping as well as for the returned part !
negative	i didn_'_t make the mistake you did ?
negative	order on tuesday doesn_'_t go out till thursday
negative	i '_m living in the usa and had some flowers delivered to my mam for mothers_day .
negative	the flowers were rotten , old , rose stems snapped and the flower sitting out of the water .
negative	obviously been sitting in some warehouse pile since midweek .
negative	you would have thought the delivery service would have had the intelligence to realize the flowers were only suitable for the bin .
negative	will never use this service again and will be seeking a refund .
negative	they didnt send the order to the take away because i only put i my email , they emailed me asking for my number which i supplied then they did nothing
negative	then after an_hour and complaining they only told the take away about half the food i ordered so i got ripped_off for money too !
negative	hungry house and just eat are miles better
negative	i have had a terrible first experience with partsgeek and will never order from this company again .
negative	i found the part i needed from them and it said it came with everything required to complete the installation , gaskets and hardware .
negative	but when i received the part there was hardware and no gaskets .
negative	i submitted a customer service ticket letting them know and they told me to let them know the make and model of my vehicle and they would send them .
negative	after i sent them the info they request they sent me a link back in reference to these parts for me to purchase .
negative	i sent them another email and copied and pasted all the previous ones of them telling_me that they would send me the part no problem and they wrote back saying sorry for the inconvenience they will mail the gaskets right_away .
negative	well , that was a week_ago and i still don_'_t have gaskets and they never emailed me a order / tracking_number either .
negative	it '_s also super irritating that they don_'_t have a customer service phone_number that you can call and take_care of something quickly instead you have to submit a complaint ticket and they will get back to you in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	terrible company , stay_away from them !!
negative	!
negative	when i picked_up the van i noticed a dent that was not included on the contract .
negative	i brought this to the attention of the agent on duty .
negative	she rudely told me to see the man in the garage .
negative	there were many men in the garage and she did not indicate which one .
negative	i asked her why she was mad at me when i was paying a lot of money to rent the van .
negative	she said that i was not paying her but paying autoeurope .
negative	i told her that she was the representative of autoeurope and she was lucky to have a job with them .
negative	she completely_ignored me and went about her own business .
negative	finally i was able to find someone to help me .
negative	no one went over the rental_agreement , nor did they inform_me of any additional_charges that may be charged when i returned the car .
negative	i was charged an_additional $_000 . 00 with no_explanation as to the charge .
negative	sold me a bad part , then wanted me to send the part back so they can send it to the manufacturer to confirm its a crap part before they would give me a refund , meanwhile my car is stuck in the shop and i am looking for another part all over again .... horrible experience , dont_waste your time or energy with this sad excuse of a company !
negative	would never buy from them again .
negative	yea the price might have beat the other guy by a couple but i called my order in and the counter guy tells_me that there shipping from ny and your in from ny so i say thats great .
negative	it took 00 days to get here i would have rathered to spend the 00 dollars more and use my local advance_auto or autozone then wait all that time my local stored told me 0 days .
negative	so go check my ticket and i would fire that guy_who took my order and lied to me .
negative	i am telling_everyone this story and there not buy nothing from you if you dont neither do i
negative	i ordered a part for a customer they did not have the part .
negative	i was not informed of this until i sent a email_asking when i could expect the part . they then let_me know they had no_idea when they could get one .
negative	oreilly ordered me one had it in 0 days
negative	so i figured that i wanted to use my xbox_000 over the summer and went to cjs to pick_up a 0 month membership card .
negative	i ordered it and never got it til the following_morning then i went to work came back home ready to activate the card and play and guess what !
negative	i only had 00 out of the 00 characters necessary to activate the membership so now here i am still_waiting for a response from these awful support reps .
negative	i have still to yet to get those final 0 digits ...
negative	i ordered a part for my 0000_mercedes_c000 waited a week for my part to come only to find out i was ship the wrong part .
negative	i was ship parts for a mercedes_c000 .
negative	its has taking forever to get this issue corrected .
negative	now i am being told that i have to pay for return shipping .
negative	why ?
negative	i dont_know why i should have to pay when they made the mistake .
negative	0 calls of 00 min average in the phone plus rude conduct is what it took me to find out i could not change the purchase my daughter had made 0 min after purchase .
negative	even having paid the $_00 fee to change flights with 00h after purchasing .
negative	outstanding company and service .
negative	highly ( never ) recommendated !
negative	absolutely terrible !!!
negative	i have ordered from partsgeek twice and both_times the order was not in good order .
negative	the last time the part was defective - clips on the grille assembly for bmw000i were broken rendering the part unusable .
negative	the worst part of both experiences is the frustration of not being_able to speak with a live_person about the situation and how the return_policy works .
negative	i '_ll never order here again !
negative	!
negative	please see detailed complaint sent in
negative	i received a damage box and broken item .
negative	i emailed customer_support twice and still no response .... never ordering from here again ...
negative	you never sent order but kept shipping cost order no . 00 - 0000000 only refund $_00 . 00
negative	buying anything from partsgeek is a big pain in the ass .
negative	their service is very poor .
negative	information on parts stinks .
negative	this is the second time ive tried to give them a chance and the last .
negative	its impossible to get any answers .
negative	the item was in back order and they never told me , tried to communicate with them but no answer , even more impossible by email
negative	not only did i feel the value for some of the item was unfair but i saved the transaction and started again in the morning seeing the total change in 00_hours down to over a pound .
negative	sent to 0 discs in but was told the barcode was rejected or missing which caused my total to go down yet again .
negative	funny how one of the dvds barcode was a popular dvd that sold a crap load in britain and if they can '_t find it which i did online then there is no hope for this company .
negative	took almost two months from sending it to receiving the money .
negative	next time i '_m going to a real magpie to get a fair deal .
negative	proof of purchase : 0000000 00 / 00 / 0000 £_00 . 00
negative	bank_transfer complete .
negative	please allow 0 - 0 working days for it to
negative	appear in your account
negative	- how come they dispute anything under 0_stars .
negative	can someone say trying to fix ratings ?
negative	i have been trying to obtain a credit for a returned part for two months and am still_waiting for a credit on my visa .
negative	you can not talk to a person and they will not talk to you .
negative	i have given them all the information they asked for including a tracking_number proving the part was returned over a month_ago .
negative	today , they said they e_mailed the return department and would get back with me .
negative	apparently they do not have any phones and could not call their return department to confirm what the tracking_number already proved .
negative	after two months there surely should not be any 00_% stocking_fee applied .
negative	i will gladly write an update when this situation is complete .
negative	ordered from partsgeek . i order online from other_vendors frequently . my delivery took_longer_than_expected .
negative	i made inquiry on their website . it took about a week for response .
negative	i received the wrong part , no fault of mine . i tried another inquiry on their website .
negative	it refused my inquiry . there is no contact info on the website .
negative	i found their phone_number on a website where complaints about bad customer service are made about businesses .
negative	partsgeek , apparently , very commonly fails to correct errors , and calling their customer service phone consistently drops your calls , and this was mentioned on the bad service website .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	check out the reviews online , and see for yourself .
negative	if you don_'_t receive the part right the first time , you can forget about it .
negative	sold me a bad part . would not give money back .
negative	total_lack of basic skills needed in auto industry .
negative	would not let them touch a hot wheel . will be filing a complaint
negative	scam .
negative	do not use under any circumstances .
negative	ordered it 0_weeks_ago paid in full on credit_card and still no sign and i paid for shipping which said it would only take 0 days .
negative	had to change reservation from 0 to 0 night .
negative	this cost more than two_nights .
negative	spend a long time on phone with two agents who could barely_speak_english .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	tried to go back to the original two_nights at old rate .
negative	was told the system would not permit this .
negative	it would be cheaper for me to check out after one night instead of the new one night cost .
negative	i still do not understand how this system works .
negative	tried the online method with no satisfaction .
negative	frustrated bookit . com customer !
negative	i received the protein but have not received my creation .
negative	i have emailed the company to find out where it is but they have not replyed .
negative	give me my item i paid for or my money back , you thieving f %$ ks
negative	you charged me for the same day delivery as it was my sisters birthday on may_00th , you delivered them on may 00st , you need to figure_out what someday delivery means .
negative	i ordered a replacement grille for my ' 00 camaro .
negative	( case #_0000000 ) the part received didn_'_t fit ( states it is for ' 00 -' 00 camaro ).
negative	i notified you by email with photos showing the side mounted screw_holes , vice top / bottom in replacement received and asking for proper replacement as well as return_label for the one i had .
negative	i received a form reply that a full_refund was authorized and being_processed .
negative	i wrote back ( case #_000000 ) asking for some contact information .
negative	i '_ve just received the same form reply that a refund was forthcoming .
negative	i '_ve tried your customer service telephone_number numerous_times and can '_t get anyone but a recording .
negative	why can '_t someone tell me what '_s happening ?
negative	don_'_t you have an ' 00 replacement grille ?
negative	won_'_t you send a return_label for the wrong one sent to me ?
negative	don_'_t you care if you have a happy customer ?
negative	if you don_'_t have the right part , i '_ll try elsewhere but i am very disappointed with your customer service to date .
negative	i ' d appreciate talking with someone .
negative	dkmorris0 @ cox . net / 000000 - 00000 thank_you
negative	they are selling cd - keys that they don_'_t have on stock .
negative	they took 00_hours to anwser my mails to just answer " tomorrow morning more keys available ".
negative	i don_'_t even got an_apology .
negative	worst service ever .
negative	even chineese companies have better communication .
negative	they charged my credit_card over 00 times , then all of a sudden wouldnt let_me buy tokens anymore , they told me i could no_longer buy tokens , because they couldnt * verify * my account * i uploaded all the paperworked required for this , still they wouldnt verify my account .
negative	lol .
negative	they told me to use only my credit_card , which i did !
negative	after they let_me buy tokens 0 more times , froze my account after each purchase !
negative	then after spending over 000_dollars , they make it so i can no_longer buy tokens again period !
negative	stay_away from this site at all costs unless you like losing your money !
negative	these_guys repeatedly billed my credit_card after attempting numerous_times to cancel my account by calling in and by canceling on the web .
negative	their apps are all half built and the functionality just doesn_'_t work .
negative	it sounds_like a great deal , but it '_s all just really half pulled together .
negative	i strongly dislike .
negative	their prices are great , but you get what you pay for .
negative	placed order and it was shipped quickly , however they sent the wrong part .
negative	the mirror came in an untaped box , with no packing_material and no invoice .
negative	the only phone # listed had me on hold_forever and i wound_up hanging up after half an_hour .
negative	they had a link on the website for problems , which they apparently only handle via there web - site , so i entered my info .
negative	the following_day i received an e_-_mail which i responded to by saying i ' d like to speak to someone .
negative	i asked to speak with a customer service rep 0x via an e_-_mail and never received a call despite them telling_me i would hear from someone within 00 - 00_hours on all 0 requests .
negative	there was also never a name of a parts_geek rep listed at the end of the e_-_mails .
negative	never a apology , and never a concern for my getting the part i needed .
negative	i have to send the part they sent me incorrectly back to them and pay that shipping as well the shipping cost for them to send me the part originally .
negative	if i were to order from them again whats to say i would get the correct part ... i may have to ship item back to them ... could go on forever with me wasting money on shipping_costs due to their errors .
negative	this company obviously does not care about their customers at all and has horrible customer service !!!
negative	i will be notifying the better business_bureau even_though it will cost me more money .
negative	the last e_-_mail they sent me said the part # on the item i received match what was ordered ... not so , unless they have an error on their web - site .
negative	i feel they are scammers .
negative	would never recommend this company to anyone .
negative	never received my order ...
negative	i ordered 00 foot pool hose thinking it would work
negative	on my kreepy krawley cleaner .
negative	your website should say not for automatic pool cleaners .
negative	like other_sites do .
negative	cost me $_00 to return hose .
negative	serviceman looked at grill took my check stated i would have estimate in two_days never received estimate , called and was told service man was very busy and kit would take a few more days .
negative	i asked for a supervisor , or owner .
negative	they were on vacation and be back in a week .
negative	i didn_'_t want to wait two to find out how much to repair or should i but new unit .
negative	i have been without a rill and had a july_0th party with no grill .
negative	parts arrived a week after order .
negative	got canned responses " customer service will respond in 00 - 00_hours " and no one called or answered my questions about tracking_number , who was delivering the part , when it was shipped , and when us it arriving .
negative	impossible to call and talk to a real_person about an order .
negative	found part on my doorstep over a week of trying to contact someone at parts_geeks .
negative	for the same " 00 - 00 hour " answer several_times .
negative	no one ever called after telling them my phone_number a dozen_times .
negative	they are only on line and never speak to a real_person .
negative	the $ 0 coupon to answer their survey never states it is for orders over $_000 .
negative	very sneaky come on advertisement .
negative	the coupon_code arrives and it is for only ordering parts over $_000 .
negative	say it up front parts_geek .
negative	u think the parts_geek customer service needs revamping and their canned " 00 - 00 " hour response is really bad turn_around time since emails can be sent in a nanosecond .
negative	they need new management or a new business plan because it really was disappointing not knowing when the parts will arrive and sho us shipping it .
negative	bad shipping practices .
negative	the customer service canned emails say they will send tracking_number when the parts are shipped but never did .
negative	i cant_believe that this company would ship small parts in box 0ft x 0ft x 0ft with no packing around them
negative	i had the misfortune to deal with tennisnuts recently , they sent me a pair of substandard k - swiss tennis_shoes twice they lasted 0_weeks each pair !
negative	!
negative	when i informed them they were very slow in responding & tried to charge me more money when i changed model on the 0rd time of asking .
negative	also i asked one of their sales_team ( william ) to get a supervisor to contact me in early september regarding setting_up a deal to sell rackets for my company matchpoint tennis coaching services .
negative	i still_await a call ??
negative	when i phoneed a week_later he informed me that they had been busy in sales meetings & someone would contact me .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for that call .
negative	in all i find them very unprofessional & will inform all my clients not to deal with them .
negative	tony cherry bsc
negative	bought a " new " mode machines krp - 0 phaser pedal from them .
negative	the boxes / wrappings looked like they had been opened then taped_shut again which was suspicious .
negative	the legs on the bottom of the unit were missing .
negative	loose screws .
negative	knob coming off .
negative	one particular nut was installed backwards and was falling_off .
negative	plugged it in , didn_'_t work .
negative	so i emailed them about it , explaining that i couldn_'_t get it to work , and they never got back to me .
negative	so i opened it up and found one of the fuses was missing ( there are two ) and i found one blown fuse that didn_'_t even look like it was the proper fuse for the pedal .
negative	there were cables unplugged inside too .
negative	what a f * cking mess .
negative	i ended_up spending about 00 dollars in parts and labor to fix the unit .
negative	last time i ever shop there .
negative	how you expect an review if the item is not even ship yet .
negative	i purchase this for my wife '_s birthday and its been a week and i have not receive anything from you except this stupid email for a review .
negative	if it came after her_birthday then i will probably have the watch return to them for a refund .
negative	contacted this site 0_weeks_ago for a comparison regarding my annuity .
negative	no contact has_been made with me by e_mail , telephone or letter ,. i suspect there is not enough in my pension pot for them to be bothered to contact me .
negative	i ordered a simple radiator_hose for my ford_expedition .
negative	it took over a week to have it delivered from california to texas .
negative	thank_goodness i don_'_t live on the east_coast .
negative	i order things online all of the time and this is by_far , the slowest delivery that i have ever had .
negative	i ordered computer parts from china and they got here in 0 days .
negative	the chinese beat us again ... go figure .
negative	we got a 0 " rack drawer , the latch did not latch .
negative	had to take it back .
negative	went to warehouse in springboro , oh the place is now like a prison could only talk to someone over the phone in lobby .
negative	got a r / a # from person on the phone and i was on hold for over 00_mins .
negative	then handed the drawer to a guard there to be returned .
negative	i was told that i couldn_'_t get another one for at lease 0 to 0 hours .
negative	had to drive 00_mins to get there .
negative	i have been a customer for many_years , mcm_electronics has got to big for there customers .
negative	they don_'_t care .
negative	my company needed the piece we order it so it would be at our office a head of time of our date we was to leave but on the day we had to leave we find that latch did not work and had to take it back , if i had waited_until they got around to getting to me , we would have already been gone to a job out of state .
negative	lucky we have another warehouse account and we got it from them .
negative	oh and guess what !
negative	they walked_into there warehouse got a drawer for me .
negative	to bad mcm could not walk over to a shelf in there warehouse were i was standing out in the lobby and get me a drawer that was build right .
negative	my part was shipped usps instead or ups or fed_ex .
negative	i do not receive mail from usps and they do not send to po_boxes , so my part was returned to sender .
negative	i made several_attempts to contact parts_geek to reship my order to the correct address with no luck .
negative	parts_geek customer service is all on line with no one to talk too .
negative	i ended_up ordering from one of there competitor .
negative	good luck if you have any_problems .
negative	well i place a complaint and they reply back saying that : sorry that my account will be credit .
negative	when i check my account days i look for the refund and nothing shows as a refund .
negative	...
negative	i don_'_t think i can trust this site anymore .
negative	..
negative	you already have my money , what do you say , you give me the parts now ?
negative	and a refund for the lousy shipping .
negative	in your e_-_mail you gave_me a fake tracking_number and the delivery date was to be 0 / 00 / 0000 ... it '_s now 0 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	man up buddy .
negative	do the right thing here .
negative	items are broken and to return them , take a long time .
negative	i bought this gift_card as a birthday_present for a friend .
negative	when it arrived , the card was battered , had different_kinds of glue stuck all over it ( which took an hours work to remove ) and was obviously used many_times before .
negative	the bar_code on the back is largely rubbed off , so i am hoping it will be accepted at the store .
negative	the skimpy discount offered is not worth it .
negative	spend the extra dollar and buy a new card !
negative	this is the last time i will be buying from parts_geek .
negative	the support is more important that price .
negative	i can understand_why you screwed this order up , in that parts_geek '_s part number for the wiper_blades was nowhere to be found on the actual wiper_blade package .
negative	so how would your warehouse people even know that they were shipping the part that was ordered .
negative	so as of now , two things could have happened : the bosch unit you have in your system for the c - 000 is incorrect ; or , alternatively , the wrong part was " picked " in the warehouse to fulfill the order .
negative	you can '_t tell which if the real root cause , since none of the part numbers match .
negative	please_advise what i purchased from you .
negative	than you
negative	i rely_on any company that buy from during the christmas season to provide reliable information_regarding shipping and delivery estimates .
negative	some , i know must ball park the delivery estimate ; however the shipping estimate is well within the control of a company ; especially one that sells gift_cards .
negative	well , that being said ; because of their inaccurate shipping estimate , gift_cards that i sent to family_members that were supposed to arrive this week ; are now scheduled to arrive a little too close to christmas for my comfort .
negative	had i known that shipping the cards out would have taken longer , i would have gladly paid for more expedited_shipping .
negative	update_: what a great gesture it was for dan to invite me to reach out to him directly to resolve this issue .
negative	i certainly sent an_email directly to dan to for his help on this matter .
negative	unfortunately , it was as i suspected nothing more than a gesture .
negative	i have yet to hear back from dan and i sent the mail directly to him on friday , 00 / 00 .
negative	it makes me wonder_if these other " customers " are real people .
negative	surely no organization is this bad at customer service inconsistently .
negative	the tinting of the sunglasses was inconsistent and the left and right lenses were quite different .
negative	delivery . com had an $ 0 . 00 discount in effect for last weekend .
negative	it didn_'_t appear on my checkout screen .
negative	according to tweets on the screen , other people seemed to be having the same problem .
negative	thinking it would appear as i checked out , i did so .
negative	no discount , and the sale went final .
negative	i then emailed delivery . com four times .
negative	no reply and still no discount .
negative	why all the emails offering the discounts if a ) there is a problem with the website and b ) when your customer service has no_intention of making things right ?
negative	thanks .
negative	stuck in nepal ill and in severe pain trying to arrange a connecting_flight from london to glasgow for when i arrived back .
negative	phoned helpline on e_-_mail / e_- ticket : got a call_centre where operator could barely_speak_english -- could give me no information whatsoever - got the contact no .
negative	wrong several_times through lack of english . had to phone back at my expense over a five and a half_hour period before i got an actual bravofly official .
negative	might have got cheaper flight if i hadn_'_t had delay .
negative	very stressful and frustrating .
negative	why the need to go through an innefficient intermediary in this day and age ?
negative	?
negative	i order a part for my son '_s vw_jetta that looked like a really good deal , but to my dismay ; after paying and receiving a tracking_number , the part never arrived .
negative	after several_attempts to contact parts_geeks at the 0 - 000 number and listening their music only to be directed to their online customer service link ; i still would not receive a response until i advise that the better business_bureau would be my next stop .
negative	i then received a response and an_apology and the promise of shipment and a new tracking_number .
negative	that was a broken promise or stall tactic , because after two_weeks i still do not have my purchase .
negative	the company seems to be a scam that uses your money and does not have merchandise on hand from my experience .
negative	i am now in the process of disputing the charge and asking for reimbursement of my credit charges .
negative	was supposed to receive order by july_0th .
negative	today is the 0th and still no delivery .
negative	i paid_extra for the earlier delivery .
negative	not at all happy .
negative	will not order again
negative	they lost my reservations and could not find them in their system
negative	i sold there fort a short time in early 0000 .
negative	they have no phone_number that you can actually talk to a representative of this supposed company .
negative	i think it is actually a one man operation .
negative	i abandoned the storefront and shut the store down .
negative	i kept recieving bills from them so i finally communicated through email that i no_longer operated a storefront there and to please close my account .
negative	they said i owed a few dollars ( which i did not ) but i paid it anyway to end my relationship with this joke of a ebay wannabe .
negative	i continued to receive emails saying that i owed money and that the shop was still open .
negative	i have screen shots of not even selling anything for over a year .
negative	i have screenshots of where i paid that $ 0 . 00 , or so , that they said i owed them .
negative	however they continued , for over a year , to email me monthly claiming i was incurring charges and needed to pay .
negative	they would always end the email with " if i did not resolve this issue they would call me on the phone ".
negative	they never have !
negative	now they have resorted to threatening me with reporting me to a collection agency for monies in which i do not owe !
negative	i can not call them since they do not list a phone_number other than a fax_number .
negative	stay_away from this basement operation and ebay wannabe .
negative	i have emailed them once again to resolve this issue and if they do not get their records straight then i am going to have no choice but to enter into a internet wide smear campaign and contact the bbb , ftc , and the commerce dept .
negative	and report them on this site and any other reporting site ( rip_off report ).
negative	if they extort $_00 . 00 from everyone that had a store there and left they would be making some money .
negative	sadly that is dishonest business_practices and against the law !
negative	our tour said appetizers and wine - correct !
negative	knowledgeable tour_guide - correct !
negative	bus and walking_tour of rome - incorrect !
negative	after almost 0 - 0 / 0 hours of walking within central rome , there was no bus in sight !
negative	we had to leave the tour at this point because it was getting dark and difficult to walk and follow the guide !
negative	it should have said that walking was the major means of touring so that senior tourists could be honestly informed .
negative	too bad that they got our $$$ and we ended_up with sore feet and a difficult walk back late at night .
negative	its companies like this that make you very wary about making internet purchases .
negative	very pleasant when making a purchase , the front of office approach and then very evasive once they have your money , which is usually ' back office ' only in this case they don_'_t have one , just a black_hole to frustrate you .
negative	i placed an order for a birthday_present with a 00 - 00 days promised delivery , they took my money very promptly and that '_s about as good as it gets .
negative	i waited 00 days and prompted them for a delivery , response was slow and eventually was advised that they were experiencing problems .
negative	00 days went by and i prompted them again , they responded with ' my order had been given priority and i would receive it in two_days , ah !
negative	i thought just in time for the birthday .
negative	no such luck .
negative	i received an e_mailed despatch notification to track my package , which i did , and for two_days it did not move an inch , four days_later no sign and the birthday was the next_day , so , off i trudged on the evening to buy a replacement .
negative	next_day i gave simply electronics full chapter and verse on events and advised them that the order was no_longer required and would be returned on receipt .
negative	sure_enough two_days_later it arrived .
negative	i contacted se and requested returns info , they responded with an offer of a 0gb sd_card if i kept my purchase , which i of course declined .
negative	since then , two week , despite_repeated e_mails , no response whatsoever .
negative	i have followed the usual channels to take necessary action to recover my money but really do i need this hassle from a third rate shower like this , no , i have better things to do .
negative	avoid , avoid .
negative	i ordered a fuel_pump almost a week_ago and i still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	every_single seed you get is either garbage or you dont get the right one sent out disapointed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered a queen bee called to request a status on the shipment and found out that they didn_'_t have any queens available .
negative	website not accurate
negative	slow to refund money paid for purchase .
negative	i will not do_business with them again .
negative	kept calling and leaving messages no response .
negative	really shocked at the poor service as i had done business with them before .
negative	finally received a refund
negative	found another_vendor who provided the replacement queen the next_day .
negative	they advertise prices that are cheaper_than other sellers .
negative	then charge ridiculous high handling_charges that don_'_t apoear until the end of check out ..
negative	ordered a power tool online that i needed by monday .
negative	they assure me saturday delivery ( i even had the retailer contact fed_ex ).
negative	wait around all day saturday checking tracking and it says it will be delivered .
negative	00_minutes after the distribution_center closes ( how convenient ) i check the tracking and it says wrong_address and will now be delivered tuesday .
negative	customer service was useless and didn_'_t know their butts from a hole in the ground .
negative	now i am going to lose a $ 0000 job because the driver is a moron .
negative	my apartment complex that they couldn_'_t find ( and the address was correct ) is the only apartment complex within 0 miles in any direction .
negative	waste of a day , loss of money , and all i can say is fed_ex sucks big time .
negative	ordered a part that they said was an exact oem replacement for my car make / model / engine type but it was not .
negative	now i have to send it back and waste more time .
negative	i booked airfare and lodging through travelocity for a family vacation .
negative	i needed to cancel the hotel reservation which was within the hotel and travelocity policies ( no cancellation_fees ).
negative	travelocity refused to issue me a full_refund for the lodging , shorting the credit to my visa_card by $_000 . 00 .
negative	after 0 calls and approximately 00_minutes of talking to non_- english_speaking travelocity customer service agents to no_avail , i turned the issue over to my credit_card company to resolve .
negative	i doubt that i will utilize travelocity services in the future due to my lack of confidence in their ability to take_care of the customer , which should be their main priority in earning business .
negative	extremely disappointed ...
negative	this is a follow_up to a purchase gone wrong and they wouldnt refund my money for their fradulent advertising on goods they do not possess ..
negative	took_forever to get my shades after fighting with owner , and many rude emails .
negative	my credit_card numbers were taken and were used fradulently by this company in ny .
negative	police reports filed and they are currently being investigated .
negative	also filed with the bbb where this companies poor ratings are off the chart !
negative	ripe with fraud .
negative	buyer_beware they are straight up thieves
negative	first ... in my case i need to know who you ' re gonna ship the part with .. i don_'_t get usps where i live .. so the part i ordered was returned undeliverable .
negative	second .. i filled_out a support_ticket as per y ' all instructions ... it '_s been 0 days .. no one has contacted me .
negative	second ticket has_been filled_out since yesterday , 0 / 00 / 00 ... so_far , no response .
negative	thirdly , i think it '_s very arrogant of your company that your customers cannot contact you directly at your customers convience .
negative	the other online auto_parts sites have a phone_number or instant chat where you can talk or at_least message a live_person instantly .. at the time you ' re looking at their site for the part you need .
negative	when we get past this part , i '_ll never use you again .
negative	i ordered a catalyic converter and not only did they send me the wrong one , they want me to pay the shipping_costs to send it back to them . and then tell me i may have to pay a restocking_fee of 00_% for something that is totally their fault !
negative	i am trying to resolve this matter , however as it stands now i suggest to anyone that is considering using this company , dont !
negative	having ordered the trampoline on friday_night i was expecting next_day delivery to be on the monday but obviously saturday is not classed as a working day , unfortunately i still have not had the item because the company computer system went down and they were unable to process the orders .
negative	it would appear that it will be delivered on wednesday , strange how i recieved an e_mail requesting my opinion , so obviously parts of the system knew who had ordered what .
negative	no communication from the company and when calling them the feeling is that ' well thats the way it is ', no attempt to recover the situation .
negative	the worst customer service i have ever_experienced , even to the point where the staff were providing me with false_information to prevent me from receiving a refund for a cancelled flight .
negative	i will never use tripsta ever again to make a booking , nor will i ever recommend them .
negative	i ordered an iphone 0 factory_unlock for an at & t phone .
negative	i was promised multiple_times that they were working on it and that it would take 0 - 0 business days .
negative	it has now been more than double that , and my phone is still not unlocked .
negative	this phone is not black - listed in any way and they verified it as such when they took the order .
negative	they are just scamming people out of their money .
negative	none of the dealerships that i had gotten a truecar price from were willing to accept the truecar price quoted online .
negative	i had the so called " certificates " with me from truecar .
negative	not a pleasant car buying experience .
negative	it was the same old crap you get at the dealerships .
negative	truecar , apparently you ' re a joke to the car industry , and now you ' re a joke to me .
negative	i sent my e_-_mail about three_days ago but no one called me back .
negative	i ordered 0000 replacement mirrors .
negative	i received 00 - 00 replacement mirrors .
negative	i waited several_times for over 00_minutes trying to reach somebody by phone with no answer .
negative	i placed a service ticket via the internet and now have to wait 0 - 0 days for an_rma authorization .
negative	they didn_'_t mention anything about getting the correct parts shipped .
negative	ordered two tyres plus inner_tubes plus energy pack , they shipped the wrong_size tyre , they did not inform_me that the other items were out of stock , i had to find that out for myself through the order tracking facility on he web_site when the items did not arrive .
negative	there is no contact number and question to customer_services via the web took over two_days to answer .
negative	as i needed the tyre inthen and to spend considerable time sourcing them else where .
negative	if you have a problem use facebook and they will answer quickly to try and get you off the public page .
negative	bought flight cancellation_insurance but to no_avail when time to cancel !!
negative	!
negative	after purchase of parts " laser cut to match " my make and model of vehicle , the parts did not fit .
negative	i emailed for a rma aand it took 0 days to get the rma .
negative	the email informed me the shipping i paid would not be refunded and i was responsible to ship the defective / incorrect parts back .
negative	all this has_been done through form email responses even after repeated_requests for personal contact .
negative	i will be out $_00 should i accept these terms .
negative	very , very poor customer service .
negative	wepay prides_itself as being different from [_external reference_] and while [_external reference_] certainly has a few issues of its own , wepay is very far behind .
negative	it also prides_itself for its personalized customer service , but that is easily said when they only communicate to inform you that your account is being terminated .
negative	in the meantime , emails remain unanswered .
negative	this is my experience .
negative	i signed_up with wepay and within a few_minutes , i was good to go .
negative	i filled in some very basic information , such as name , phone , address and ss #/ ein .
negative	i also uploaded a link with reviews from our clients .
negative	as for many other customers , wepay started processing payments for me and then one of them stayed in pending mode .
negative	i contacted customer_support and charlie informed me that our information couldn_'_t be verified and suggested to re - enter it , which we did .
negative	then .... nothing .
negative	after several unanswered email , i was simply informed that my information couldn_'_t be verified and that therefore the payment had been cancelled and my account terminated .
negative	wepay did not even ask me for proof of id and address .
negative	their procedures seem very arbitrary and do not display proper due_diligence , in a field in which it is absolutely paramount .
negative	my customer and myself were left hanging for 0 full days , after which i but also my client received an_email from wepay in which they explained that they would not be processing any further payment for us .
negative	for a company which prides_itself with customer_support , this is an interesting one .
negative	our client , very understandably , has now lost trust in service providers such as wepay and [_external reference_], but also , questions our honesty .
negative	it is appalling that wepay can so quickly damage a reputation which i have put so much work into building .
negative	i warn current customers and people considering wepay .
negative	my situation is far from isolated .
negative	do not give them a chance to damage your business .
negative	for reasons beyond my control my plans had changed and i needed to cancel my hotel reservation so i was charged for 0 night_stay .
negative	i did not appreciate the 00hr cancellation_policy .
negative	typically the cancellation_policy is 0 or 0pm day of arrival at the hotel which i did meet this criteria but this was not the case .
negative	i will not be using the reservation_counter again to make my reservations .
negative	after spending over 00 min with reservation_counter to cancel and then back and forth with the hotel this was inconvenient and not in my best interest after all .... thanks .
negative	part faulty never worked i have emailed the company and have not had a reply as of yet 0 days_later not good
negative	i ordered a book which was shipped on may 0 , 0000 .
negative	over a week has passed and i have a tracking_number that won_'_t tell me when the book will be delivered .
negative	i have contacted the company which tells_me they don_'_t know anything .
negative	i am frustrated and would not use this service agains
negative	i will not make another purchase .
negative	totally dissatisfied with the steak .
negative	are you guys serious .
negative	i purchased parts and you sent one correct item for my 0000 lumina and the other part was for a 0000 camero with boot prints on it and then you expect me to pay to have it shipped back and wait for 00 days to be refunded and then reorder parts and pay shipping again .
negative	that means i pay shipping three_times .
negative	i see why you don_'_t have a phone_number to contact you .
negative	why don_'_t you respond to any negative_reviews ?
negative	there is no way to contact you other than fax or email so i have to believe all the negative_comments that i '_ve read about your company .
negative	lesson_learned
negative	havde_bestilt en buket til 000_kr .
negative	mere_end et døgn før ønske om udlevering .
negative	blev ringet op 00 minutter før butiklukketid og_fik at_vide , at de desværre havde solgt de blomster , som_jeg_havde_bestilt .
negative	jeg bad euroflorist om at sende fra en_anden butik ( alternativt anden by ) - det_ville de_ikke .
negative	så_jeg_fik_en_anden buket - andre farver og blomster end dem som_jeg_havde_bestilt_og betalt for .
negative	sidste_gang_jeg bruger euroflorist !
negative	i orderd a short shifter from them .
negative	then get a phone_call a week_later , stating that they did not in fact have the part i wanted .
negative	within one week of making my first order with ink_farm , my credit_card was hacked and people in the netherlands were making purchases with my credit_card .
negative	weird how that happens isn_'_t it ?
negative	note the sarcasm font .
negative	order placed on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 item still not delivered so i called the customer service line - that '_s really worth if you want to have a bit laugh .
negative	some speaking corpse will ask you to press 0 or 0 depending_on if you have or don_'_t have an order but you even can '_t be sure if you are speaking with the correct company as the will not tell you some " hello , here is .." then i had to wait 00_minutes !!
negative	to get an advisor to speak with me .
negative	and i '_ve been told that i placed my order on 00 / 00 / 00 and 00 / 00 / 00 that item ran_out of stock and that '_s why they didn_'_t dispatch my order .
negative	weird .
negative	i really don_'_t understand this logic .
negative	but mainly - wae_+ didn_'_t even bother to contact me and inform_me about any possible delays , apologize , offer some solution - nothing .
negative	they just let it be .
negative	if i wouldn_'_t call i would wait and wait and wait ...
negative	the person on customer service just told me that the item had to be delivered 00 - 00 / 00 / 00 and asked if i want to keep the order or cancel .
negative	so i let her to cancel it , she confirmed that and i wanted to know when will i get my money back .
negative	she told me to log in to my account for this information and i '_ve answered that i have troubles to log in to my account on their website and if she could just answer .
negative	to be honest i had to ask 0 or 0 times and on the end she told me that the refund will take up to 00 days !!!!
negative	so 0_weeks_ago i paid something which they didn_'_t send and even didn_'_t inform_me about it but they have my money for nearly 0 months .
negative	perfect .
negative	and of course - the " help me log in " button on their website doesn_'_t work .. a v o i d
negative	...............
negative	now - about one hour later i '_ve contacted wae_+ to request an immediate refund otherwise i '_m going to report them to which !
negative	magazine , cab and fso .
negative	will update when i get any response from wae +.
negative	did not receive some of my stuff .
negative	firstly my ordered hasn_'_t even arrived yet !!
negative	rang them no answer straight to answer machine !.
negative	i '_ve been trying to chase them up at for the past 0 days !!
negative	no joy !
negative	i don_'_t think i will be eva ordering of them again !!!!
negative	!
negative	mo kolia .
negative	have you ever used your site ?
negative	is this what you want ?
negative	people to place their orders by phone ?
negative	" a customer_support staff_member has replied to your support request , #_000000 with the following response :
negative	we suggest placing your order on the phone to prevent selecting the incorrect items ."
negative	first you select the year , then the make , and then the model .
negative	you tell me how i selected 0 right part and 0 wrong part !
negative	i make my choice between better or best , it is that simple .
negative	maybe you should try hard to get the right part that your customers order .
negative	this is not rocket_science , don_'_t say that i selected the wrong item when it was your mistake .
negative	on line or on the phone would not have mattered .
negative	now i will move on to the survey that i received for your web_site and the next time i need a part i will not give parts_geek the time of day .
negative	sincerely robert k .
negative	i '_m sure they sell a great deal online but when i used my cc .
negative	they sent an_email with no way to get_ahold of them telling_me since my billing and shipping addresses are different they will not place my order .
negative	that '_s fine and i appreciate the security however , why no call or providing a way to contact ??
negative	missed sale and all futures .
negative	never received my order .
negative	also old email was used .
negative	when i first placed my order i specifically_asked that teleam @_gmail . com be used not this one .
negative	thomas eleam
negative	you sent me the wrong part .
negative	i '_ve been infuriated with paypal many_times , but after costing me $_000 . 00 in overdraft charges because of a mistake on their end ( they attempted to explain_why i was uninformed ), i want nothing more to due with this company .
negative	i owe these_idiots zero dollars - not a red cent .
negative	so just how can you force them to close your account ?
negative	i '_ve requested numerous_times and they just ignore it .
negative	is this something that needs to be reported to appropriate authorities or agencies to take them to task .
negative	after all , they have my ssn , current banking information , address , etc .
negative	before our trip we paid online for our parking up front , and then on the day of travel called as instructed one hour ahead of our arrival to be told ," there won_'_t be room for you on the shuttle ."
negative	despite my explaining we had purchased and paid for this , she said , " too bad , the shuttle at that time is full .
negative	you can go a half_hour later ", which wouldn_'_t have worked for our flight time .
negative	we went anyway and at the front_desk when we arrived we were told the very same thing , " so sorry , no room ."
negative	we went out and got on the shuttle and there were empty seats !
negative	just an added stress at the beginning of a long travel day .
negative	on the return we were consistently misinformed by the receptionist brenda about how low we would need to wait outside .
negative	" 00 - 00_minutes ."
negative	that was still her answer 00_minutes later .
negative	from the time we had called with out bags and were waiting outside until we got picked_up was over 00_minutes .
negative	0 southwest airline pilots were also waiting that long and were cursing that the delay meant they wouldn_'_t get to the hotel in time to get their required 00_hours rest to fly on schedule the next_day ..
negative	this is a hotel , not a parking service .
negative	the have the asphalt and the shuttle to try to make an extra buck , but give no effort to help the traveller or provide parking service .
negative	one star only for a polite driver chris who did not stop apologizing for the very long wait and terrible service we received .
negative	never do this again .
negative	the only way to contact customer service is by email , is takes about 0 days to response and they response what ever they want , not what you asked .
negative	i received a part that doesn_'_t fix with my car , after more than a week dealing_with their " customer service ", the response was " our catalog said it math with your vehicle , by this point we can only offer is a return ", i told them " i '_m still need that part , what options do i have ?"
negative	but no answer , so i loose : 0_weeks , shipping and returning charges , and by now i don_'_t know when i will received my refund and if will be complete .
negative	i will never buy something to parts_geeks .
negative	we had paid for a citroen_c0 but we got a toyota aygo , which is quite a lot smaller .
negative	after complaining to hertz in fuerteventura and rentalcars in copenhagen we were told that we could get half of our prepaid rent refunded (!)
negative	or upgrade to another category , which was twice as expensive .
negative	we ended_up taking the car but one from our group had to take a taxi with some of the luggage .
negative	vi_havde_bestilt en " citroen_c0 ell .
negative	lign ."
negative	men fik i stedet en toyota aygo der størrelsesmæssigt svarer til_en c0 ( men_som_er_en betydeligt ringere bil ).
negative	det betød at vi_ikke_kunne have vores bagage i bilen og at en rejsedeltager måtte køre i taxa til hotellet .
negative	vi_havde først forsøgt at få ombyttet til_en større bil hos hertz som afviste os blankt .
negative	en opringning til rentalcars . com hjalp os heller_ikke .
negative	horrendous , awful , atrocious -- think of all the negative adjectives and they will apply to this retailer .
negative	i knew i would end up regretting buying from this website but because they showed a pair of sunglasses in stock that i really wanted , i risked it .
negative	the first dead giveaway that this would be a nightmare was the fact that they had every pair of sunglasses ever made listed as in stock on their website -- whenever you see items on a website that are discontinued or over 0 years old , it '_s most_likely a bait - and - switch operation , as smartbuyglasses . com is .
negative	i ordered a pair of sunglasses that were already 0 years removed from the shelves , i made them confirm that the sunglasses would look exactly like they did in the picture , a chinese guy in broken english responds saying they confirmed with the manufacturer that they were exactly like the picture .
negative	i wait for a month and half before they finally arrive , they are of course not as pictured on the website .
negative	they then make me take a picture of the sunglasses to prove it , refuse to pay return shipping ( even_though they sent me the wrong item ), and then , after receiving my return , act like they never received it and made me hound them to issue a refund .
negative	the whole time you are dealing_with someone in china .
negative	the only_thing i say as a positive is that the sunglasses did appear to be genuine .
negative	i beg you to not purchase anything from this website .
negative	they are horrible and you might up having to deal with a huge headache like i did .
negative	not worth my time !!!
negative	company should be closed for good !!!!!
negative	they dont care about there long time customers !!
negative	!
negative	had a flight canceled and could not reach anyone for information or to help get me another flight .
negative	the flight i booked cost $ 0 , 000 . 00 one way to california , thanks for nothing and poor service .
negative	i have purchased a radiator for my 0000_dodge caravan .
negative	when i received the radiator , it was broken .
negative	the bottom left of the radiator was broken .
negative	not to mention it was also bent !
negative	i immediately emailed partsgeek . com of the issue .
negative	after more than 00_hours , partsgeek . com responded to my issue .
negative	they have emailed me " i do apologize for what has happened .
negative	we value you as a customer of parts_geek , and as courtesy we can reship the item at no extra_cost to you .
negative	please_advise if this action will suffice for a resolution to your matter .
negative	( if applicable ) returning of the damaged / defective item will not be necessary .
negative	you may discard the item only after you have received a usable replacement .
negative	if you do not wish for a reshipment and would simply like a refund we will tag the item for you , or issue a credit for the missing item .
negative	again please_advise which action you would prefer thank_you !
negative	after that email , no other response when they will ship me a new radiator .
negative	three_days_later , i get this email from them "
negative	a customer_support staff_member has replied to your support request , #_000000 with the following response :
negative	thank_you for contacting parts_geek .
negative	our office is currently closed .
negative	all inquiries received after normal business hours will be answered the following business day .
negative	your inquiry will remain open .
negative	please do not submit a duplicate ticket .
negative	customer service hours : monday - friday 0am est - 0pm_est .
negative	closed saturday .
negative	sales hours : monday - friday 0am est – 0pm_est and saturday 0am est - 0pm_est .
negative	we appreciate your business !
negative	thank_you
negative	customer service
negative	after this has_been sent to me , i '_m still_waiting for someone to call me and today is tuesday the 0th of november .
negative	please_note that my vehicle is not running and waiting for this radiator so i can use my own " paid off " vehicle verses taking the bus to work and school .
negative	i '_m very disappointed with this internet company and i know for sure this will be addressed to the better business_bureau .
negative	will let you know after i one of the others ?
negative	part was billed and order confirmation was received .
negative	i waited patiently for the part , only to be told after the package was not delivered and i followed_up to find out why ( when it was much too_late already ) that parts_geek was out of stock and had canceled my order without notifying_me of the cancellation in any fashion .
negative	an_apology was made , but that does not compensate me for the loss of time , or for the loss of the sale of the vehicle that occurred because the part was not delivered when promised , and the buyer moved on to another car because mine was not ready .
negative	terrible failing in customer service , and failure to provide any compensatory remedy .
negative	parts were in stock and shipped out on time however i ordered a gov spolinoid and speed sensor combo for my dodge_truck .
negative	i later found out that if i ordered the parts separately i wood have saved 00 bucks when i called to change the order they said they could not change the order unless i sent the parts back and they reshipped them even_though they were the identical parts
negative	absolute rubbish
negative	this place was not as_described .
negative	the room had some real issues .
negative	the door_lock did not work it was busted .
negative	the floor was raising up and separating .
negative	the bathroom was a mess and the tub had bugs crawling in it and looked dirty .
negative	the bed and pillows were worn out junk .
negative	the pictures they show are not true to description .
negative	they are done in a perfect mock up .
negative	the staff in the lobby were a joke .
negative	they were very rude and acted_like it was a major distraction just to help you .
negative	i could keep going on but the best thing i can tell you is .
negative	don_'_t stay here !
negative	0 ) i asked for a total price for a bike with accessories , both bike and accessories appeared on the website !
negative	0 ) i got a price but on another and more_expensive bike , as the requested bike was not in sale anymore , even_though it appeared on the website !
negative	0 ) the price was suddenly not including the accessories as requested , and i was charged extra for the accessories !
negative	given a 0 hour_window for a large purchase .
negative	they did not deliver .
negative	getting my money back was like drawing blood from a stone
negative	when it was near to the end of the allocated time_slot i tried phoning the branch using the number on their invoice , but it was a fax line .
negative	tried phoning the delivery branch , 00_minutes of holding on got me nowhere other than a depleted mobile account .
negative	no service at all
negative	they failed to provide the serice bought .
negative	they were given written notice that was so and given time to provide it or i would consider the contract terminated .
negative	they ignore this as they did all letters whether sent by recorderded and even registered delivery .
negative	they passed it to debt collectors who gave up when they saw the file .
negative	unbelievably a further 0 debt collectors got involved they too gave up on seeing the file - as there was clarly no debt as all bill were paid up to the time of the contract being terminated .
negative	totally hopeless to deal with , have moved the account
negative	i buy goods online - have recently had 0 occasions when failed deliveries were due to " no one in " and " card left " lies .
negative	on both_occasions i was in stting in my office all day overlooking the drive and front_door .
negative	no attempt at delivery and no card .
negative	a 0 rd delivery - a day late , one item from 0 was missing ( some £_000 value for that item )
negative	you cannot_speak to them .
negative	the enquiry line on delivery requires you to enter the delivery ref i , e , the card left - but usually there is no card .
negative	a fourth delivery , the driver brought be goods for a mr k .. in sevenoaks - i live on the isle of sheppey some 00 miles_away .
negative	i could go on - suffice to say , my trade supplies are now crossed of list if they use city_link
negative	they promote services and prices that are simply not available to a large number of people , have spent many an_hour wasting my time trying to sign_up for an advertised product not available to me .
negative	difficult to navigate and annoying in that so much that is shown as at stores when you go to them they do not have it .
negative	they need to sort themselves out .
negative	now my store of last_resort
negative	that they should even consider charging for the loo shows the depths to which this company will go
negative	very poor search facility
negative	arrogant , close accounts and hold back tradersmoney for ages for absolutely no reason at all just on their whim .
negative	and conversley protection for the buyer of services is none existant .
negative	they also ignore what you have to say
negative	there is no way to speak to people with a problem and unless you are dealing_with the items amazon are good at - books and the like - the delivery service is a shambles
negative	the sales offer said delivery 0 - 0 working days .
negative	i took the trouble of telephoning to ensure stock was available and that the delivery dates could be met .
negative	i had a prompt return telephone_call to confirm that was the case .
negative	after the 0 working days were up i telephoned to find they did not even have the goods to despatch , and delivery could be the following_tuesday or thursday .
negative	i told them it had to be the tuesday .
negative	that was met
negative	on delivery , the delivery people insisted the product had to be unwrapped .
negative	i refused .
negative	my onward customer would not want a product not in its original wrapping and the van did not have a shrink_wrap machine on board .
negative	it got farcical with them making me speak to their office who also somehow did not understand the meaning of " i am not unpacking it "
negative	there was absolutely no need to as any obvious problem would be visible under the transparent packing , and while the packing was damaged , holed actually in the base , no_doubt due to careless internal trucking ,
negative	they they had the supplier call me who rang off before i could answer the phone , i tried their number 0 times but without answer .
negative	not a good buying experience and i would not deal with them , i would rather pay a higher price and get better service .
negative	i was , frankly , a typical uncaring on - line service example .
negative	i purchased a ecm ( computer ) for a 0000_suburban .
negative	it was delivered on time and for a great price .
negative	however all other_suppliers of the same unit requested year , model and vin_number to allow them to program the computer prior to deliver .
negative	partsgeek requested year and model , but not vin .
negative	perhaps that should have been my warning that it would not come programed .
negative	well in did come un - program .
negative	this required the vehicle to be towed to the dealer and negated any cost savings i anticipated .
negative	i should have purchased it elsewere .

negative	habe am samstag zum ersten mal über ebookers eine reise gebucht .

negative	ich erhalte in kürze eine entscheidung .

negative	try to read google ' ualadys scam '
negative	order a pair of glasses , after 0 separate times of returning them due to wrong prescription , and 0 month from initial order , they still could not get my glasses correct .
negative	finally had to insist on a full_refund
negative	flowers delivered to wrong_address , the man at the wrong_address was kind enough to bring them to my mothers door ( they had the correct address on them ).
negative	most of the heads of the flowers had been cut_off .
negative	waste of money and time , ruined my gift .
negative	to top it off they have stopped replying to my emails .
negative	company failed to deliver product as_advertised .
negative	i gave them multiple opportunities to correct the error , yet they ignored me .
negative	i eventually initiated a charge back , and the company proceeded to harass and threaten me by e_-_mail after my credit_card company investigated the claim and ruled in my favor .
negative	i received e_-_mails shortly_after receiving these threats from the company ( within 00_minutes ) informing_me that someone was trying to access my accounts .
negative	i strongly_advise against doing_business with this company .
negative	i '_ve already reported them to the federal trade commission and intend to involve law_enforcement if the harassment continues .
negative	i ordered a compact camera at the start of the week .
negative	site says delivery takes between 00 and 00h , with free shipment for orders over 000ron .
negative	after i already confirmed my ordered ( which was over the 000lei threshold ) i was informed delivery would be made in 00hrs and would cost me 00ron .
negative	upon_receiving the package i found the camera box itself had the seal broken , with the software disc missing .
negative	not recommending to anyone and definitely not buying from them again .
negative	ok so first i type in the part i need which was a window_motor for a 0000 infinity m00 .
negative	the web_site says they have it so i order it , then when the conformation_email comes showing me that its not the right part but for a 0000 m00 and i try to stop the order they have no number you can call to stop your order and i emailed and still couldn_'_t stop it , so now i had to pay for shipping , pay to ship back , pay a restocking_fee and all for them lieing about the part they were shipping which the might have thought would work but is not the same thing and they are acting like its my fault i order the wrong part .
negative	i would recommend this label making company to all my friends .. great service , easy to understand directions , and fast delivery .
negative	we will be using them again .
negative	do not use this store the money you might save is not worth it , they do not deliver on what they say , and they will keep telling you it will arrive , they said that the last pre_- orders would be filled the 00th of march at the very latest , its now the 00th and they have not said anything about why , they do not respond to anything except for with automated_replies that makes no sense in the context and that just shows they dont even bother reading what their customers says its all copy paste , been waiting since the 0rd of march now to get my sim_city limited_edition key it was going to get there on the 0th and then the excuses just started .
negative	do yourself a favor and stay_away from this unprofessional company .
negative	i placed an order for almost $_000 . 00 and was told the product would be arriving in 0 - 00 days .
negative	after a month , i called to check the status of my order and they continued to lie to me .
negative	telling_me this and that , and when i asked if they would please just give me a delivery date , i was told it would be 0 - 0_weeks !?
negative	dont tell people that you stock the product , when you dont !
negative	as far as the quality of the product , i will let you know in 0 - 0_weeks ...
negative	the website said the part fits my vehicle , i ordered the part and paid for shipping .
negative	upon_receipt of the item is was the wrong part even_though the website and the label on the part said it was for my vehicle .
negative	in returning the item , i had to pay for shipping and i had to eat the original shipping charge as well .
negative	basically , the shipping_charges almost equaled the cost of the part .
negative	i will probably not use this website again due to this policy even_though it was the website error not mine .
negative	undoubtedly , talktalk offers good value for money in terms of the ' phone , broadband & tv packages which it supplies .
negative	however , it '_s customer service is provided by overseas call centres and it '_s impossible to speak to anyone with enough authority to set the rules aside when the situation demands ( and certainly not anyone uk based !)
negative	.
negative	we signed_up for the youview service as soon as it was announced and have been happy with it overall .
negative	but , at the end of march , the on demand facility stopped_working .
negative	i called the support number and spent over an_hour on the ' phone while a technician talked me through checking various bits of the equipment ; which involved , among other things , unplugging one of the power line adaptors - the one connected to the modem - and then replacing it afterwards .
negative	when replacing the adaptor , i asked the technician specifically whether it mattered which port i used for the network cable , and was told clearly that it didn_'_t .
negative	when he had exhausted all possibilities without resolving the problem , he said he would arrange a home visit from a uk technician .
negative	i was not impressed to be told that the earliest it could be arranged was three_days away but , eventually , had to accept that talktalk simply doesn_'_t employ enough technicians to offer a better service .
negative	since the offered appointment was quite impossible for us , it was actually six days_later that the technician came .
negative	the technician was very good and the problem was fixed quickly .
negative	however , he discovered that the network cable to the modem was , in fact , connected to a wrong port .
negative	clearly , that was down to me , but only because i had not been instructed correctly by the technician on the ' phone in indonesia ; furthermore , it could not have been the cause of the original fault , as the on demand function had worked correctly for almost 00 months , since the initial installation .
negative	on checking my april bill , i was shocked to see a £_00 charge for the technician '_s visit .
negative	immediately , i called the support line and explained to the call_centre operator exactly why i believed that the visit ought not to be chargeable .
negative	eventually , he transferred me to his manager ( a particularly " jobsworth " sounding individual ) who refused to accept my arguments and insisted that no - one in talktalk would agree to cancel the charge .
negative	i have now written to talktalk at their southampton hq and am awaiting their response with interest .
negative	as long as everything is working ok , talktalk '_s packages are good value for money - but heaven help the customer when anything goes_wrong !
negative	i purchased a 00 . 00 psn_card that failed to credit my " wallet " when i tried to contact them they said the issue would be fixed ... it was not .
negative	i tried many_times to call there supposed " 0 days a week " number to get a voice_mail , i left_messages and its been over 0 days and no call back ... be_careful of these_people ... its not usally long after you find out they cant keep there promises that they are gone !!!
negative	use a better company .
negative	_very poor experience_
negative	mister auto accepted order and took payment .
negative	a couple of days_later they cancelled the order .
negative	i contacted them by the way of a premium_rate telephone_call and was told the order had been cancelled as the parts were not in stock .
negative	when asked when they would return my payment i was told in a couple of days time .
negative	it appears that they only return your payments after some undetermined timeframe at their will .
negative	they use your money on cancelled orders to bankroll their organisation , i guess it is the only way they can make a profit .
negative	items purchased over £_000 cannot be sent overseas ( bfpo adresses ) very poor_excuse .
negative	really satisfactory
negative	we rented a car through priceline following a cruise that ended in fort_lauderdale , fl early on sunday_morning .
negative	the address we were given to pick_up our car from priceline was 0000 powerline road .
negative	when our taxi arrived at that address we saw that it was a parking_lot for rental trucks and not a place where you could rent_cars .
negative	we were finally able to get to the rental_car agency we had rented from after a $_00 . 00 taxi ride .
negative	they didn_'_t have the car we had asked for and we ended_up renting a larger car for more money , plus the extra gas we had to pay on the extended road trip we were going on due to priceline '_s error .
negative	when we called priceline '_s customer care line , they refused to give us any kind of a refund for the extra money we paid and after frequently being put on hold we were offered first $_00 . 00 in coupons , and then after more extended holds $_00 . 00 in coupons to make - up for our " inconvenience ".
negative	sorry , priceline , but that doesn_'_t cut it and you have lost a customer forever .
negative	try orbitz or anybody_else , but save your money and don_'_t waste your time on this company .
negative	i had a contract with o0 for over five years .
negative	at christmas i got a new o0 contract via carphone warehouse .
negative	because the previous o0 contract had 0 months to run they insisted on charging me £_000 ( despite the fact i was staying with o0 ).
negative	i accepted this and at the time the customer service person said i would be sent an electronic or paper bill as he could not be precise about the amount due .
negative	the next thing i hear is a letter from a debit agency threatening me with legal_action if i don_'_t pay the £_000 plus an admin_fee .
negative	i tried to take this up with o0 but they refused to speak with me as the matter had been handed on .
negative	i tried to explain to the debt agency but they were not interested in anything but how i would pay this new increased amount .
negative	i agreed to pay the original amount and went back to o0 to complain_about the lack of communication and the referral to the debt agency .
negative	i was advised to use their webchat .
negative	this resulted_in 00_mins of complete and utter rubbish ( i still wonder_whether this was just a computer_generated algorithm ?)
negative	that resolved nothing .
negative	after sending further emails and insisting on a written response i did get communication from a real_person .
negative	he advised that i was sent a letter about the debt a month_ago .
negative	i did not and when i pointed this out he advised that i could access the letter i was meant to have received by paying £_00 to access my o0 correspondence - outrageous !
negative	o0 take no responsibility for their poor practice .
negative	there are so many things they could and should have done before referring me to a debt agency .
negative	they could have phoned me ,.
negative	they still have a direct_debit in place so could have accessed this .
negative	i am tied to o0 by virtue of a 00 month contract which i am not going to spend £ 000s more to buy myself out of .
negative	however they can be sure i will get as far away from them
negative	as possible once i am able .
negative	i suggest you keep away too .
negative	no good sevice
negative	the parts sent were not correct .
negative	no phone_number is provided to contact for customer_support .
negative	i had to pay to ship the parts back even_though i was not at fault .
negative	i will not order parts from parts_geek again .
negative	one order arrived 00 days after order ; still_waiting on another order , now 00 days and counting .
negative	glad i hadn_'_t run out of ink .
negative	will just go to a big box store next time - not worht the time to save just a buck or two .

negative	having spent the best part of £ 0000 : 00 on a bath the only_thing i can say is ‘ be_careful !’
negative	the reason for my comment : - the showroom staff in warrington couldn ’ t be more helpful ; it seems to me that once they had my money the service went_downhill from there .
negative	firstly , on delivery , one corner of the bath was scuffed / scraped , not something you could easily overlook and because the packaging had not been removed and wasn ’ t damaged , this must have happened when being_processed through either production or at the warehouse .
negative	secondly , after the bath had been placed in my living_room ( my choice ) and i noticed the damage , i refused delivery .
negative	not a problem the driver said and returned the bath to his vehicle .
negative	he then asked me to sigh for the items i was keeping which was not a problem but in the most deceitful manner possible , hid a damage disclaimer under the delivery note and said ‘ just sign this as well ’.
negative	they had actually smashed a £_00 : 00 molton brown candle whilst putting the bath in the living_room and the driver said ‘ we should have got you to sign the disclaimer before delivery .’
negative	i still cannot get my head around a delivery company who , by virtue of their job , has to enter your property , wanting you to sign a damage waiver before they enter .
negative	are they so incompetent that this is what they have to do ?
negative	having complained to their customer_services i was informed that 0 .
negative	i couldn ’ t speak to the transport manager and 0 .
negative	he didn_’ t have an_email address so all complaints had to be in writing .
negative	a transport manager of a business with a multi million pound turnover with no email address …. rubbish .
negative	this to me is obviously a ploy to put you off complaining .
negative	i put my complaint in writing on 00th_april , adding my contact telephone_numbers and email address i sent the letter recorded delivery ; it was signed for the next_day .
negative	two_weeks_later after receiving no response whatever i had to contact customer_services again and was informed that the transport manager was ‘ dealing_with it ’.
negative	he was obviously to busy printing disclaimer forms for his drivers !
negative	it is now saturday 00th_may , one month after my letter and i still have had no response .
negative	so i am going to contact customer service again on monday and ask for the name of the managing_director .
negative	this i will pass on to my solicitor , they obviously think that being dishonest , deceitful and damaging people ’_s property , not to mention ignoring their complaints is a joke .
negative	i hope that they get a laugh out of my solicitor ’_s letter and his charges !
negative	frankly i don ’ t care if it actually costs me money , it ’_s the principal that matters to me , the customer who pays their salaries !
negative	the email i received to submit this review says , and i quote .
negative	‘ we review all the feedback we receive so would really_appreciate any time you have available to post your comments .
negative	kind_regards , the better bathroom team .'
negative	interesting , i ’ ll be pleased to see what happens because if this were my business , i ’ d be making some calls !
negative	just as a footnote , the installed bath is brilliant , pity about the customer service !
negative	your going to lose more and more clients because you do not offer renewal codes and other_companies do .
negative	its just cheaper to transfer my domain names to another company because you guys do not make an effort to keep your clients by offering renewal codes
negative	kind of makes you think how much godaddy care about their long time clients
negative	on arrival , poor directions , then when we got to the right place had to wait for 0 minutes for the person to turn up .
negative	on return , mobile not answered then when tried to call again only got voicemail .
negative	ended_up standing in car_park ( at 0am ) for over 00minutes before the car finally turned_up .
negative	and then the final insult - it had been clean at drop_off but on return was filthy , entirely covered in a layer of dirt that you could write in .
negative	stress - free ?
negative	the opposite .
negative	waited 0 hours for the room to be ready , even when i booked an_hour ahead , room was still dirty and it was a non smoking and smelled of smoke .
negative	i requested a 0 :_00am wake_up call and never got one , causing me to miss my flight .
negative	this was and will be my last visit to the red_roof inn oklahoma city ok
negative	i tried for over two_days to get someone to pick_up the phone at this place , no one ever did .
negative	i tried to return an oil_pan they had mistakenly sent me and i guess i will be stuck with it , just a bulky paper weight .
negative	i am done with partsgeek i would rather pay double the price and get the service and part i need .
negative	i still_havnt receieved package
negative	driver didn_'_t show to work , had to wait nearly an_hour for a ride to the airport .
negative	i ordered the book " pennsylvania 0rd grade math test prep for common core learning standards " the second week of january .
negative	my paypal_account was charged .
negative	later on i received notification that the seller does not have the book in stock and my money was refunded .
negative	again , i saw the book at bookbyte from another seller .
negative	i purchased .
negative	the same experience followed .
negative	they didn_'_t have the book .
negative	this continued 0 times .
negative	finally i gave up .
negative	but i have to tell you that i received my money back .
negative	after that episode , i ordered another book " spectrum pennsylvania test prep grade 0 " through bookbyte on jan . 00 .
negative	i have not still received the book .
negative	it has_been more than 0_weeks .
negative	meantime i called bookbyte , they said they couldn_'_t tell me the reason for the delay .
negative	my pay [ pal account has_been charged .
negative	the status of the order says the book has_been shipped .
negative	so i order a tail_light_lens for my acura_tl type s and they send me the wrong part .
negative	then it happens a second time .
negative	part not available due to japan flood .
negative	finally the get the right part and send it out last_week .
negative	wrong again !
negative	no phone_number to call .
negative	no live voice to yell at .
negative	these_guys suck
negative	do not recommend to use
negative	only part of my order showed_up .
negative	i received no notification of any backorders or problems .
negative	i need the missing part that day , so i bought one locally and called them to tell them to cancel my order for that part and refund my money .
negative	i was on hold_forever and never got a live_person .
negative	i emailed them and told them to cancel .
negative	the following_day , i get a reply stating they don_'_t know what happened , but will ship out the part the following_day .
negative	i email them again saying no , i don_'_t want it .... i '_ve already bought the part locally .
negative	well , a few_days_later the part shows up on my porch while i '_m gone .
negative	i was unable to refuse shipment b /_c i was gone .
negative	now they want me to pay to ship the part back .... what a crock !
negative	purchased a low beam headlight for my car that didn_'_t end up being compatible even_though the site said it would .
negative	even if i shipped back the item , it wouldn_'_t be worth the refund .
negative	i bought a part for my 0000_camaro ss and came defect , that '_s not their fault but i send it to returns_department for exchange or refund and is being more than 00 days without an answer back .
negative	still_waiting for my part or refund !
negative	!
negative	no customer service to speak of .
negative	even_though they sell and send wrong parts , you have to pay to send them back with no reimbursement for shipping .
negative	paid_extra to have the parts sent " two day " and got them a week_later .
negative	can '_t talk to a live peron and are very slow and impersonal getting back to you .
negative	i will never buy from them again and regret giving them any of my business .
negative	i know its a cheap airline but easy jet cancelled my flight 0 days in a row , i missed my holiday and got no money back from the insurance .
negative	if that wasn_'_t bad enough they stated that they couldn_'_t give me any money back for my return flight as i didn_'_t check in as they only give refunds if you '_ve turned_up for the flight .
negative	even_though the reason i couldn_'_t check in to come_back is because they cancelled my flight out .. if it didn_'_t cost me my whole holiday and a very upset daughter it would have been laughable .. anyway .
negative	it doesn_'_t matter_how cheap they are or where i have to go i would never set foot on an easy jet plane again .....
negative	terrible customer service , and a non_existant flight .
negative	the whole episode cost me over £ 0000 .
negative	which i havent received a penny back from easyjet or the insurance company .
negative	the insurance wanted a letter from easyjet stating the cancellations as proof which easyjet also never sent ...
negative	so 0_star is actually too high ...
negative	i give a no star_rating !!

negative	i will never use the days in nashville parking service again the problem was that the address that you gave_me was incorrect it was not murphreesboro road it was murphreesboro pike and i ended_up almost missing my flight because when i called the place the man didn_'_t even know the difference_between the two and couldn_'_t direct me to the parking area
negative	on their web_site they said they part was in stock
negative	took my payment and confirmed the order
negative	0 days_later the cancelled
negative	vi ville stærkt anbefale at ikke rejse med sunweb .
negative	jeg og min kæreste bestilte_en rejse til alanya over en måned før afgang og_når vi kommer frem er_det_ikke hotelværelse til os de to første nætterne .
negative	i stedet bliver vi sendt til to forskellige hoteller der_var mindst sagt i en lavere standard .
negative	mange_andre gæster havde betalt 0000kr mindre per person og_meget senere end os men alligevel fået værelse alle dage .
negative	når vi ringer til sunwebs hovedkontor får vi meget lidt hjælp hvor en rigtigt uhøflig dame ikke_vil give os mere_end 000kr per person og massage i kompensation .
negative	vi synes ikke det_er fair at vi_har betalt mere_end de andre gæster og_får dårligere service og_så når vi spørger om at få tale_med hendes chef vil hun ikke en gang tale_med os .
negative	har_brugt flere timer foran receptionen og i telefon for ingenting når_man hellere kunne nyde af sin ferie .
negative	første og sidste rejsen med sunweb for vores vedkommende i hvert_fald !
negative	all they do is mirror hotels personal websites and steal their profits . when you search for a hotel their web_page pops_up first , but no where on these sites do the list that that they are working with expedia . com .
negative	they only list a toll_free which makes you think your calling the hotels toll_free number .
negative	i belived i was talking to the hotel and asked if i could hold a room for my parents with my card on file until my parents paid for their room with their own card when they check out .
negative	i was assured that this was not a problem .
negative	never once did they tell me that that they are not the actual hotel so they can '_t hold the the room on a different card or that i would be charged for the room once our call was over .
negative	i '_m still trying to get compensated for this issued that happed almost 0_weeks_ago .
negative	when i call them and ask the supervisor to call me back they only e_-_mail me with only apologies for their staff '_s mistake .
negative	when i e_- mailed them back , they don_'_t respond back or it '_s way past when they told me i would hear from them .
negative	so save_yourself a lot of time & hassel and make_sure you call the the hotels personal dirrect line and don_'_t be scammed like i was .
negative	never use the " reservation_counter " it not worth your time or money .
negative	give your money dirrrectly to the hotel who rightfully deserve it , since they are the ones who will be providing you with their services and taking_care of you .
negative	i began to use bookbyte through a referral from a friend .
negative	i used them twice before with no_issues , until my recent class .
negative	when i rented the book , clearly in the title it stated it came with the cd material .
negative	when i received the book it did not come with it .
negative	when i emailed customer_support they stated in the terms and conditions extra material cannot be guaranteed .
negative	i had to cancel my class and reschedule due to me not being_able to get the new material in time .
negative	they informed me to send the book back for a refund .
negative	i sent the book back on july_00th priority_mail .
negative	over a week_later i emailed them and they claimed the did not receive the book .
negative	so now what a coincidence , customer has a bad_experience and instead of issuing the refund , you say you did not find the book and of course if the book is not received within the end of the rental period i am charged full_amount ?
negative	what kind of business is this ?
negative	of course a business can be good when everything runs_smoothly , but when issues arise , don_'_t screw the customer , especially students who bare enough costs as it is .
negative	my take is go with other rental sites , as this one may costs you more than extra money in the long run .
negative	follow_up to your reply below : this was shipped 00 days ago and there is nothing in your system indicating your company has received it ?
negative	i have used usps_priority for years and normally it is delivered anywhere in the us within 0 business days .
negative	how is it that when a refund is requested the book cannot be found ?
negative	i have been a loyal_customer until this point .
negative	your company could have made much more due to my many classes , but this experience is not good .
negative	so let_me guess if this book cannot be " found " i will be charged the full_amount ?
negative	the item sold to me does not match the item on partsgeek . com '_s website .
negative	when i contacted partsgeek . com , someone emailed back after 0 days and told me the part " fits my car ".
negative	they didn_'_t acknowledge the wrong part , they didn_'_t acknowledge the incorrect advertised item , didn_'_t acknowledge anything other than " it fits ".
negative	you can not email partsgeek . com unless you use their form and wait at_least two_days for a response .
negative	they do however , email you .
negative	phone_calls are answered via an_automated operator and they will not accept your call .
negative	i sent a complete description including their webpages with their error - no response .
negative	yes , i notified them immediately upon_receipt of the package via their website form .
negative	so , be warned .
negative	if you get the wrong part , even at the hands of partsgeek . com or due to an error with their website offerings , they are not ready and willing to assist you in getting exactly_what you need .
negative	i '_m glad i didn_'_t order something more specific or expensive than i did .
negative	i made a mistake on my order and tried to cancel it but was told its not possible even_though the order was just submitted .
negative	never do_business with them again and told them as much and all they had to say was it was in the terms of sale that i accepted .
negative	maybe so , but i will not make the same mistake twice .
negative	did you even read my review ???
negative	?
negative	when i got the email , i immediately called you and was told that that email goes out since the last one was sold to me !!!
negative	when it didn_'_t arrive i called again , and was told it would be in on may_00th and would go out that day .
negative	it went out one the 00th electronically by usps ; nnot expited as requested .
negative	it seems that evey one of your negative_reviews on here has an excuse by youor blames the buyer .
negative	the customer is always right in my business !
negative	your apology should have read , we are sorry , we screwed_up and our employees will be better trained to make you a happy client .
negative	i chjange my rating to 0_star accually it is " 0 " star .
negative	ordered a dainese air - framejacket red & grey at full price because they said it was in stock .
negative	could have saved 00_% on sale from another supplier , but did not want to wait .
negative	, because i was going on a trip 0 / 00 weekend .
negative	got an_email that it was not in stock ; called and was told i got the last one .
negative	days went by and i called again and was told it was to arrive from dianese ( was not in stock ) on may 00 and i asked to have it expedited .
negative	finally got an_email that my order was fulfilled , and a usps tracking_number that i had to figure_out who '_s number it was .
negative	it was not expedited !!!
negative	unfortunately , i have to use my older hot jacket this weekend in florida .
negative	i will not recommend or do_business here again .
negative	looking for parts order satis # wo000 - 0000000 and # wo000 - 0000000 .
negative	call me at 0000000000
negative	the good , ease of ording , the bad , receive wrong part , the ugly , can not get an answer or call back from you ........................
negative	just come home from a holiday " arranged " by supreme travel .
negative	the trip to and from the hotel was an_absolute nightmare .
negative	we were in alanya , turkey , and the trip took us 00_hours !!!
negative	( last_year we were in thailand , and the trip home from bangkok to us well under 00_hours !!)
negative	among other things we had a 0 hours intermission in düsseldorf - both_ways .
neutral	mr b t lowe
neutral	something that really bothered me was a $ 0 . 00 handling_fee that showed_up out of nowhere during final checkout .
neutral	it '_s not the amount that bothered me but i think it is kind of sneaky to tack this on to the total just before completing the order .
neutral	i went back afterward and read the terms and policies but there is no mention of a " handling_charge ."
neutral	the shopping is a bit frustrating and the shopping_cart itself can be " finicky ."
neutral	i spent much time browsing the catalog and adding items only to have the contents of my cart disappear without_warning .
neutral	this happened several_times before i finally_decided it '_s best to go through the catalog and write down what you want , then go back and enter your order all in one sitting .
neutral	on the plus side , the site has an abundant selection and very good prices .
neutral	the workers were very helpful but i didnt realize
neutral	the money would be taken out of my account immediately .
neutral	and then my husbands buisness trip was cancelled the day before so i lost some of my money .
neutral	but they did help me recover some of my money by cancelling a few_days .
neutral	i wont ever use call_center again !
neutral	!
neutral	deliverys ) ups varygood fedex varygood = but fedex_smartpost takes weeks and weeks the worst i aver seen never a again
neutral	bought a deal at the rat trap inn .
neutral	had to book by phone .
neutral	i made seven phone_calls and left_messages & contact number for return call .
neutral	no return call , found another phone_number for the inn .
neutral	could ' nt book the 0 nights b_& b as they were fully booked until after the wowcher promotion ended in october .
neutral	emailed wowcher for a refund , no reply , rang wowcher , was told my complaint would be passed on , still no reply .
neutral	they only seem interested in the sale itself .
neutral	i '_ve now raised my rating from 0 to 0 as i have had a return call .
neutral	very understanding and apologetic .
neutral	promised to resolve my issues .
neutral	looking_forward to receiving promised refund next week ..
neutral	got the wrong part .
neutral	however i was able to modify it .
neutral	an anoyance otherwise things were fine .
neutral	i purchased 00m ^ 0 of " stadium turf " from onlineturf .
neutral	it was delivered on time , however several ( approximately 00 ) of the rolls were torn and the turf itself was of very poor quality ( thin and listless grass ) when compared to turf i bought from a local farm last_year .
neutral	i bought 0 tyres in october_0000 for my mercedes - the prices were great , and i found the site very easy to use .
neutral	however , upon visiting the " premier_partner " to have the tyres_fitted , everything broke_down .
neutral	the garage staff were unfriendly , they didn_'_t confirm any of my details , they didn_'_t explain the pre inspection process ( the wheels should be checked for damage before fitting ).
neutral	when i returned after 00_minutes to collect the car , the fitter expected me to sign the post inspection form before i viewed the car , and when i pointed_out this made no sense he just walked out !
neutral	not what i ' d expect from a " premier_partner ".
neutral	i was pleased with the products and services but i can '_t understand_why the price increases that is the most disappointing factor
neutral	ordering was fine , tyres were not delivered to the garage on time .
neutral	however , customer was excellent keeping me informed and tyres were fitted with a minimum of fuss .
neutral	it '_s just a shame i had drive round on the temporary tyre for 0 days longer_than necessary .
neutral	would use again though .
neutral	i hope i get the same discount with free shipping as previous order on my next delivery of dog_food .
neutral	we have hired many cars during our travels , but this one would have been in the worst condition .
neutral	it had body damage at many sites , the carpet was completely worn at the pedal site , and it was less_than spotless when we picked it up .
neutral	in spite of all this , it performed_perfectly well .
neutral	order was short by one part but site corrected right_away .
neutral	would have given higher star but package was poorly_packed and short one part .
neutral	road_radio helped_me to resolve a technical_question by putting me in touch with kenwood technical , so i bought the kenwood unit that i wanted from them .
neutral	road_radio '_s prices are very keen and they seem to have good stock_levels .
neutral	however things fell down badly on the delivery .
neutral	i waited in all day for the courier , only to find that the dab antenna was missing when the unit eventually arrived at 0pm .
neutral	i waited in another full day for a courier to not arrive with the missing part , only to be told that road_radio had in fact posted it instead of courier !
neutral	aargh !
neutral	eventually got my complete unit after 0 days of waiting in .
neutral	your service provides valuable information but i do not like the fact that i can only receive an updated credit_score every three months .
neutral	also , i found the process to dispute items on my credit_report to be very clumsy .
neutral	for a long time i have driven about 00 miles to get the specific brand of food that my dogs like .
neutral	when i saw it was available on petflow i thought it was worth trying .
neutral	the ordering_process was very straightforward , the price seemed reasonable and because of the quantity i purchased i also got free delivery .
neutral	the food arrived nicely boxed in just a few_days .
neutral	but on the downside , when we opened the box we found two deflated air_pillows on top , which apparently were supposed to cushion the product during_transit .
neutral	there was no other packaging protection .
neutral	something incredibly heavy must have been placed atop the box because not only were the packaging cushions completely deflated , but the food was so compressed that it was formed into one giant , solid 00 pound block of crushed food .
neutral	disappointing result .
neutral	descent availablity of parts .
neutral	no confirmation of order and if items have shipped .
neutral	same as all the rest , keeping the prices high by tricky marketing .
neutral	the filters weren_'_t wrapped at all in the box .
neutral	i was expecting them to be individually_wrapped so i could store them in the garage and not have to worry_about bugs and dust getting on them .
neutral	some the frame edges were bent .
neutral	for the price i paid , they should have been wrapped in plastic and straight as an arrow .
neutral	it was 0 of only 0 wallets available for the galaxy note 0 .
neutral	it will work for weekends when i carry very little in my wallet .
neutral	i say that because there '_s really not much room for cards & casy
neutral	arrived at sea mist resort on thursday , may 00 , 0000 , around 00 : 00_pm .
neutral	the front_desk personal was very friendly and efficient .
neutral	i call the front_desk two times , and both_times i was greeted very professionally , and they did not mind answering my questions .
neutral	a big_plus was the welcome call , once i checked in .
neutral	i was suppose to have a ocean_view room , what looked out towards another building , which was disappointing .
neutral	the room was clean , which was a plus .
neutral	the elevator was not the best , it almost stuck between floors .
neutral	i was in one of the older buildings and they were celebrating 00 years ....
neutral	the downside of my stay was the very poor internet service .
neutral	the wifi would connect , but that is all you could do .
neutral	you could not get online .
neutral	for that reason , i would not stay there again , but for the money , it was clean .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
neutral	some of the menu options that are available on seamless are not available on delivery . com .
neutral	applying promotion_codes used to be confusing ; a recent update has redressed that somewhat .
neutral	delivery . com '_s support is slow to respond .
neutral	the replacement part arrived and was defective .
neutral	i already had the dash dismantled and couldn_'_t wait for a replacement so was forces to disassemble the new part and use parts to make the old one work .
neutral	parts are good , what i didn_'_t like is how long it took for them to get here , it took for ever , maybe faster service ?
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i kept our apointment time but the garage was not ready and started the work 00mins late but stated on the paperwork , when i checked it later , that the job started on time .
neutral	i was not asked to complete the pre_- fitment check and was only asked to sign the paperwork twice once the car was ready .
neutral	i was not invited to inspect the work but the paperwork , once read later , states that by signing i confirm that i am fully_satisfied and any that disatisfaction will be comprimised .
neutral	if you want the paperwork to apply them you work to the letter of it including accurate times , filled it pre and post check .
neutral	the garage was not as efficient as a normal tyre installer and if i can match the b ' circles price in future by a main_stream fitter then i would prefer them over a garage who fits tyres when the lift is available .
neutral	why give a specific time if you dont intent to work to it , i was asked if i wanted to leave the car as clearly they were not ready to do the work .
neutral	score 0 out of 00
neutral	very impressed with online capability - easy to use .
neutral	however , given i placed my order from the usa , i was expecting an_email_confirmation when delivery was made - delivery was supposed to happen yesterday but , well over 00_hours_later , i still dont_know if it was delivered or not - this is a significant service issue and would really round out what looks_like a good online product
neutral	good - the parts were available and a good price , bad - the wrong parts were sent , good again - the correct parts were sent once i notified customer service .
neutral	i '_ll give them another shot .
neutral	the blind i ordered is as requested , the online ordering was easy and the sizing straight_forward .
neutral	a wooden frontpiece to cover the metal casing at the top was scratched quite deep for about six - inches but i had some wood stain knocking around in the shed and managed to mask it .
neutral	i didn_'_t send it back because taking delivery did present a problem .
neutral	the delivery address_label ( my office address ) did not include my name though it was included in the delivery request , and some of the address was missing (' bowling ' became ' bow ').
neutral	the postcode was correct but it was delivered to the wrong building ( and business ).
neutral	not sure whether it was signed for but it arrived to me , opened , after doing the rounds next door whilst they were trying to find who it belonged to .
neutral	could it have been scratched during this process ?
neutral	who_knows but who do you blame ?
neutral	i found it propped up in a corner of our post room because my colleagues didn_'_t know who to pass it to either !
neutral	i have been buying from express_medical_supply for a long time .
neutral	in the past_year there prices on breathable under pads have gone up in price they doubled in the price in 0 years !!
neutral	!
neutral	there is no reason for it !
neutral	people like me that is bed ridden and living on ssd checks cant_afford these high prices !
neutral	i started buying from espress medical because they were the cheapest i found now there the higest !
neutral	somthing is wrong here and it aint me !!
neutral	!
neutral	you sent me a new electrical mirror for my 0000 c0000 chevy pu on may_00th , the motor on it did not work .
neutral	i went on line and ordered another one order # 00 - 0000000 .
neutral	i returned the bad one rma_#_0000000 .
neutral	you have charged me for both mirror '_s , part # c0000000 .
neutral	when do i get a refund for the mirror that i paid $_00 . 00 ups to send back to you ?
neutral	being you sent me a bad part , you should pay for returning it .
neutral	thank_you ,
neutral	jack tipton .
neutral	they had the drain_plug i needed at a fair price , with fast service , but i thought shipping cost was a little high .
neutral	ordered the parts for my door_opener .
neutral	next_day [_external reference_] has a sale .
neutral	could have picked_up a new door_opener for a few dollars more than i paid for the parts .
neutral	everything works ok but ,,,,
neutral	recieved goods as_described , with fast delivery .
neutral	web_page claims free uk wide delivery saving you £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	when i got to check out
neutral	they charged £ 0 . 00 for delivery .
neutral	complained to their customer_services regarding the misleading claims on their web_page .
neutral	but was told the check out price clearly shows the delivery charges .
neutral	although i complained three_weeks_ago on the 00 / 00 / 0000 the web_page still claims free delivery .
neutral	i ordered ( 0 ) window_regulators for my 0000_f000 crew cab at the same time .
neutral	my daughter was due to drive home to colorado on 00 - 00 - 0000 as the parts were due to arrive 00 - 00 - 0000 .
neutral	when the parts did not arrive i contacted fedex .
neutral	they told me ( 0 ) was to be delivered on 00 - 00 - 0000 but the oyher ( 0 ) were shipped via_usps per parts_geek .
neutral	i had to purchase ( 0 ) regulator from a parts store in order for my daughter to leave in time .
neutral	( 0 ) regulator was delivered at 00 : 00 on 00 - 00 - 0000 and the other ( 0 ) were delivered at 00 : 00 on 00 - 00 - 0000 .
neutral	i can only hope that parts_geek will take back the ( 0 ) regulator .
neutral	i have had only 0 experience with partsgeek .
neutral	i was attracted by the low_prices for bosch exhaust sensors , which i later learned were cheaper on rockauto , which has phone support .
neutral	anyway , i needed 0 for my 0000_chevy tahoe , 0 before the catalytic_converters and 0 after .
neutral	unfortunately , since there was no phone sales or support , i ordered the wrong part for 0 of the sensors .
neutral	since i placed my 0st order over the weekend it was processed and shipped before someone answered my support_ticket on monday or tuesday .
neutral	the support response was that orders couldn_'_t be cancelled , which i already knew .
neutral	ideally , i would have returned only the 0 wrong parts and kept the 0 right parts , but without phone support i didn_'_t know that the 0 different part numbers for the same order would be shipped separately .
neutral	so i ended_up placing a 0nd order in which 0 of the 0 parts were the same as the 0st order .
neutral	currently i am still_waiting for the refund to my credit_card for the returned order , minus the 00_% restocking_fee .
neutral	my opinion is that partsgeek is an option .
neutral	if you need phone support shop elsewhere .
neutral	its good service but it takes a little_bit to long for the shiping
neutral	curtains came to size correctly but the heading was not as wanted .
neutral	my mistake was to think " curtain tape " was rufflette tape
neutral	so now there is a problem .
neutral	note_: the payment system continually put me " out of time " and it was only that the company called me by telephone that an order was placed .
neutral	i '_m happy with the glasses and the price was great .
neutral	only_downside was that they took_longer_than i was anticipating .
neutral	upside is that customer service was excellent .
neutral	a nice product which took ages to arrive .
neutral	the clip on sunshades are a bit fiddeley , but work ok .
neutral	the price was good though !
neutral	purchased two fabricated oak_worktops .
neutral	from final approval of fabrication drawing to delivery took two_weeks .
neutral	however , each clarification to the fabrication drawing took 00_hours .
neutral	yes that ’_s 00_hours for r00 to be added to the hob cut - out .
neutral	in all from choosing worktops express to the start of the two_weeks wait took an_additional 0 days .
neutral	the worktops had small number of blacked out knots on the top surface .
neutral	one wood stave had a 00mm long split in it on the top surface ( depth of the split unknown ).
neutral	the mix and match of the staves could have been better .
neutral	maybe i was just unlucky ?
neutral	the fabricated sink aperture had splintered 00mm long on the tops surface .
neutral	fortunately , this was covered by my sink ( just ); a belfast sink would have been a different matter .
neutral	one cut end wavers by +/- 0 . 0mm causing a + 0 . 0mm gap on the butt joint .
neutral	price was okay .
neutral	add in shipping that was a little_pricey and showed_up a day late .
neutral	the experience didn_'_t win me over yet .
neutral	i will come_back to look for comparison reasons against other_sites .... will see .
neutral	i placed a large order with bookbyte in order to take_advantage of the free shipping .
neutral	everything that came from their partner warehouses was fine , but i had a couple of problems with the books sent directly from bookbyte .
neutral	one was in noticeably worse condition than what i had ordered .
neutral	another was the wrong book entirely -- the titles and authors ' names were not even similar .
neutral	these two books for personal reading , not class , so it wasn_'_t a crisis , and they were both bargain books .
neutral	still , these sorts of problems indicate either insufficient training , or , more likely , a warehouse that is overworked and understaffed .
neutral	no order confirmation , no promised tracking_system , a 0 - 0 day delivery time becoming a 00 day delivery time .
neutral	i ordered a part for my 0000_saab .
neutral	the part i ordered was a window bushing regulator , a small price of plastic that holds the window in place .
neutral	i received it the shipment right on schedule however the box i received was massive !
neutral	the part it self was no larger than a quarter and the box is about 00 "_x00 ", very wasteful .
neutral	i have a picture of the comparison ( between the part and box ) and it looks silly at best .
neutral	i am a business major and i firmly believe that you could reduce your costs and the costs passed on to you customers if you ship in appropriated sized boxes .
neutral	thanks guy
neutral	lately i personally have been having_trouble with the post_office in my area .
neutral	i can see why they are losing money .
neutral	the mailman never delivered my package to me .
neutral	i literally had to chase him down just to get it .
neutral	this is no fault to you , but i wish ups was your primary shipper instead of the p . o .
neutral	i just ordered some more silver from you , i hope the delivery goes smoother this next time .
neutral	let '_s see what happens .
neutral	i ordered several parts to fix an awning on my camper .
neutral	the ordering_process was easy and smooth , delivery was on time and was within 0 or 0 days .
neutral	when i got the parts , i was missing a rivet to one of them and was unable to install it .
neutral	i attempted to find a replacement rivet at a couple of local_stores , but no luck .
neutral	i called american_rv company and told them about the missing rivet .
neutral	the first words out of the representatives mouth was , " well it ' d probably be easier for you to just go out and find one at a local_hardware_store than for us to send one to you ".
neutral	i was taken_aback by the statement , but continued the conversation and opened a ticket .
neutral	i spoke with two other people after that initial call and they were professional , responsive and nice .
neutral	in the end , the ticket was responded to quickly and i got my rivet within a couple of days .
neutral	i believe the unprofessional conduct of the first rep i spoke to was an_anomaly and is not indicative of most of the people at american_rv company .
neutral	i would do_business with them again , because they ultimately handled the situation to my satisfaction .
neutral	all the things i ordered arrived on time and in good condition , except the shallot bulbs which had a few dead bulbs .
neutral	seeds and bulbs i planted have all grown well , except the shallots which i hope will show growth when the weather gets warmer .
neutral	the red onion sets are all growing splendidly .
neutral	dobies are easy to do_business with , and have a user - friendly website .
neutral	i purchased a part , and it arrived as_described .
neutral	however ; i attempted to order additional items and the sales_dept .
neutral	failed to fullfill my request .
neutral	if you want good customer_support , order your parts elsewhere .
neutral	the part i ordered was wrong and i was trying to get the information to send it back and there '_s no way to get a phone_call to you guys i even tried_emailing and you only
neutral	send 0 email !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	your delivery took too_long and the parts arrived damaged .
neutral	usually my experience with b_&_h has_been good .
neutral	however recently i needed repair parts and the ones i ordered were incorrectly labeled as a match for what i was repairing .
neutral	they did give me an_rma to send back the parts , but they didn_'_t acknowledge that the error was theirs , they didn_'_t make any attempt to correct the listing , they didn_'_t help me find what the correct part was , and they didn_'_t pay for shipping for the return of the items .
neutral	i spend a lot of money with b_&_h , and i rarely ask for any help with my purchases .
neutral	a little time helping_me sort out this issue would have gone a long way toward keeping me as a customer .
neutral	not that they have lost me as a customer at this point , but i '_ll be more likely to look for alternative sources than i would have previously .
neutral	my order was processed and shipped quickly and the price was good but what arrived was not everything that was pictured .
neutral	i did receive the correct part and it worked properly however the package was missing some gaskets and bolts .
neutral	i had to leave town the next_day so i ended_up using the old gaskets .
neutral	most of the parts worked great .
neutral	however the return process is a pain in the butt .
neutral	one of the parts i received has obviously been returned before and resold to me .
neutral	no big_deal , but they do not cover the return shipping expenses .
neutral	and it could take up to 00 days for them to refund the money after they deem whether or not the part is able to be resold .
neutral	prices are inconsistent .
neutral	i have to play this game where they force me to search for source codes and coupons to get a lower price .
neutral	i am about ready to call it quits .
neutral	other_sources have lower prices with free shipping .
neutral	the location is very good .
neutral	the service is lovely , comfortable
neutral	hostelworld offers members a wide_range and series of hostels for me .
neutral	it is user_friendly and very helpful every time i book a hostel .
neutral	it provides me reviews from recent travelers which gives me a great deal of information for me to choose the best option .
neutral	however , i think the following are ways to improve and help us better in the future .
neutral	firstly , there is not much guidance about the myworld account on the travelling points .
neutral	i cannot figure_out why some hostels credit travelling points while some do not and i cannot find the answer to it and why .
neutral	another problem is that nobody_answers the queries .
neutral	there is no one to help when you face a problem except for the faqs , which does not provide the answer most of the time .
neutral	overall , i still regard hostel_world a great invention for frequent travelers finding a home on the way and i hope there will be better services provided later .
neutral	the last 0 - 0 purchases i have made online do not show up in the ' my account section ' of the website and this makes tracking / confirmation very difficult , frustrating and annoying .
neutral	please try to remedy this situation to improve the shopping_experience .
neutral	i ordered an_engagement_ring for my fiancée which turned_out to be a size smaller than i ordered but can '_t moan because it was still too big !
neutral	i was a very pleased with the turn_around of the re - sizing ( about a week ) but was quite disappointed with the quality of the the job .
neutral	the ring was quite misshaped when returned .
neutral	customer_services were great and offered to take it back to be assessed but my fiancée couldn_'_t bear to be without the ring for another 0_weeks so we decided to stick with it .
neutral	it kind of adds to its charm !
neutral	but overall the ring is beautiful and the clarity of the diamonds were even upgraded to d rather_than e which i really appreciated .
neutral	generally very good .
neutral	i got several heavy gauge stainless plaques made .
neutral	the lettering was fine but they plaques were sheared un - square ; that is , they were not 00 degree corners .
neutral	moreover , i got heavy stock so i could weld these onto a stainless machine surface .
neutral	the margins were so small that i could not weld them without the heat damaging the lettering .
neutral	this was made even worse when i had to machine the edges so the plaque was square on all 0 corners .
neutral	i know stainless_steel is expensive but so is my time ; i spent quite a bit of it preparing these plaques for installation .
neutral	maybe you would consider offering bigger margins .
neutral	- s . layton and layton refrigeration company
neutral	parts good and timely shipping good .
neutral	had to complete process twice , then multiple phone_calls the following 0 days from giftcard .
neutral	items purchased were not compatible with previous purchase .
neutral	unfortunately the website does not give sufficient data about the product to ensure a match .
neutral	the items were all manufactured by the same company , but model types were different .
neutral	good selection of channels but pricey and customer service isnt that great .
neutral	their prices are low but the srevice isnt that good , gets very slow at times , iv_seen much_better performance .
neutral	the delivery time was great , however the soldering guns had tips that were less_than great .
neutral	one was ideal , but the other one had a tip that was unusable .
neutral	i '_m not sure if i will return as a customer .
neutral	great service , good price , just one little catch .
neutral	the mounting studs on the tail_light were a different size and thread and the new light did not include the correct nuts .
neutral	soooo i made a trip to the auto_parts ... home_depot store and bought wing nuts and fender washers to fit .
neutral	not the end of the world but if you know the nuts will not fit why not include them .
neutral	how much can it cost constering i am already paying $_000 for a broken_tail_light_lens ?
neutral	i ordered ( 0 ) parts .
neutral	a rear control_arm that was exactly as pictured and described .
neutral	the front lower_ball_joints were not as pictured or described .
neutral	the front link kits were mix matched ( 0 ) was metal as pictured and described , and ( 0 ) was plastic not as pictured or described .
neutral	my first and maybe my last experience with ordering from partsgeek . com .
neutral	i called customer service , but they do not answer phone_calls .
neutral	you must submit a form .
neutral	seem like a hassle .
neutral	i did not feel_like taking the time to go back and forth .
neutral	i like a good old fashion phone conversation , to work out matters .
neutral	i guess they are to busy for that type of customer service ?
neutral	i had no problem with the site and the product was dispatched with admirable speed .
neutral	unfortunately i tried twice to make the order and when each failed i looked elsewhere .
neutral	i found a product £_00 cheaper and then found that i had apparently ordered the anchor pump product .
neutral	the conversation that then followed was ridiculous .
neutral	the price promise meant nothing unless you find something cheaper before ordering !!?
neutral	( why would you then buy from anchor_pumps ?)
neutral	i was told that companies at e_bay only sell second_hand products and if i wanted to cancel i must pay a 00_% administration fee .
neutral	in the end i found the management and staff illogical and inflexible and elected to buy their product rather_than pay a 00_% fee for nothing .
neutral	so much for free enterprise .
neutral	the delivery was done with speedy turn - around and the futon cover i ordered was well made and as_described .
neutral	the only problem was all me - i was confused and knew it was the next size down from a queen which i thought was a twin .
neutral	oops .
neutral	but this is where things got ugly .
neutral	these_folks have a restocking_fee and the free shipping gets charged to you if you return the item !
neutral	combine that with the shipping_charges to get it back and it was a complete wash .
neutral	i should have just kept it and craigslisted the wrong one .
neutral	your not up front with the fee the hotels charge .
neutral	after_reading the description about the shake i was expecting a taste orgasm in my mouth .
neutral	instead i '_m greeted_by a pretty average tasting chocolate shake , that tastes bitty and isn_'_t completely smooth .
neutral	on the upside it is reasonably_priced .
neutral	have enjoyed the products and services provide but also had issues with getting some of these and a refund as i cancelled a trip and rebooked it but got charged_twice then began the pain of trying to get a refund .
neutral	made a error and picked wrong return flight
neutral	called immediatly to have it switched and couldnt
neutral	do it without rebooking the whole trip
neutral	ridiculous
neutral	fast efficient service but tank digital display was showing 000ltrs before delivery of 000ltrs and 000ltrs afterwards .
neutral	short delivery ?
neutral	i didn_'_t check with my local toyota_dealership but based on other parts i '_ve bought i would expect to pay at_least $_000 .
neutral	that said , it was 0 0 / 0 " too_long and wouldn_'_t fit .
neutral	returning it wasn_'_t an option ( had to put my truck back together ) so i cut it with a circular_saw .
neutral	you can '_t see the cut because it '_s on the bottom but you need to check the dimensions before you buy .
neutral	the wheel arrived quickly , but on fitting tyres to them i found the hole for the rear inner - tube valve to be quite a bit off centre .
neutral	i couldn_'_t be bothered with carrying out the returns shenanigans as these things can be a pita .
neutral	just hoping that the wheel behaves itself .
neutral	shame really , but this is the risk you take with online purchasing .
neutral	i ordered blue with white flowers and the flowers my mom got were other colours .
neutral	maybe this has something to do with the seasons maybe .
neutral	just make the communication between the flowershops are better an that the flowers are really available .
neutral	why life is good at amazon ?
neutral	don_'_t like when i get a new message and it don_'_t give you any info on if its a collection , or a deletion .
neutral	just gives you the name of the credit company and account number .
neutral	please fix this and elaborate more details what the new message is .
neutral	used easytobook but when we got to the hotel the did not have our booking .
neutral	it took about a half an_hour before we could get it fixed .
neutral	hotel called easytobook but it was a public holiday and nobody was there to help .
neutral	that '_s it really - like topcashback , but all my recent transactions have not been processed automatically ( e . g .
neutral	pcworld , expedia , nationwide ) - have to chase and then wait months
neutral	good looking front tag holder for my 0000_honda_crv .
neutral	however , bummed out by the fact that there is no hardware to attach the device and no instructions attached telling_me how to do it .
neutral	i think i could figure it out if i had the hardware .
neutral	great prices and fast shipping but poor packing .
neutral	got the hei and cap had a 0 inch long crack in it .
neutral	needed to get jeep back on road so couldn_'_t wait for a replacement .
neutral	works_fine for now .
neutral	connecting my obi seems to disconnect my phone_power desk app .
neutral	i ' d like them both to work .
neutral	i applied to have my number ported from google and went on the googlevoice site and enabled this .
neutral	still i '_m connected to gv and i '_m getting my incoming_calls forwarded to my temporary voip number .. how can i fix this ?
neutral	i was disappointed with one of the packs of steak which consisted of 00_% fat .
neutral	the " gift " of a " cookit stick " was not enclosed .
neutral	it could have so easily been put right but my email to customer_support remains unanswered .
neutral	satisfied with service / delivery etc .
neutral	however , they are not original oral_b products !
neutral	the car i rented was fine .
neutral	getting it was difficult the place was loaded with customers waiting an average of about 00_minutes .
neutral	we all had the same issue .
neutral	long_waits poor communication and maps you can '_t read becaus the type size is too small .
neutral	yes gps would help but at 00 euros per day a ripoff just to get out of florance and travel the wine region where we didn_'_t need it .
neutral	the directions back to the train_station to pick_up the wives and baggage left us looping the old center for an_hour with one way and restricted acces roads complicating the drive .
neutral	really am i the first custome asking to drive to the train_station ?
neutral	it '_s 0 blocks walking they should have turn by turn instructions both to the train_station and out of town .
neutral	i like the way you train and work to gain money / fame / items .
neutral	kind of set_up for if you want to spend a lot of time or a little .
neutral	the problem with how games are set_up is , there really is no point to the teams so_far , basically it is build you team to be the top_rated team , no league games , championships , etc .
neutral	i can see myself getting bored of this game after i get my player better_than he is now as there won_'_t be much more to do .
neutral	parts received quickly
neutral	break pads looked like restock missing 0 of the 0 bolts coffee stain on manual
neutral	rotors in new box but completely covered with dust and dirty
neutral	good delivery times , but time allowed for inspection insufficient for bulk orders .
neutral	i found damage to the top of w . c . cabinet unit made it impossible to use , this did not worry me unduly as i had ordered the black granite top as an added option but even this item contained a blemish in the finish and has spoilt what should have been pleasurable_shopping_experience .
neutral	it must be remembered that some rooms in the household do not allow being out of commision for any great length of time .
neutral	maybe it '_s the countries i '_m trying to visit but i '_m finding a lot less hostels and related accommodation on hostelworld . com than two years_ago .
neutral	one of the hostels told me that the 00_% deposit they charge goes straight to hostelworld . com and the balance is what the hostel ( etc_.)
neutral	sees .
neutral	maybe this is not a good deal in this day and age ?
neutral	the website is frustratingly slow as well and the printouts are full of ads for car_hire etc .
neutral	but miss out on more useful_information like the map or the facilities list ( e . g .
neutral	is the place " laundry friendly " and is the wi_-_fi free ?).
neutral	i '_m perhaps getting a bit old for hostels anyway so i '_ll use booking . com and other b_& b sites from now on .
neutral	ordered the front_license_plate_holder for my truck .
neutral	the holder showed_up on time just not the bolts and / or screws to attached the plate to the holder and truck .
neutral	found out they were not included .
neutral	pretty hard to have a holder with the bolts / screws .
neutral	couple of days ago i booked an ocean_view room in a beach hotel and payed in full ( booking #_0000000 ).
neutral	however when i got a confirmation it was for a partial ocean_view room .
neutral	contacted olotel . com and they wrote me back saying they would contact me in 00_hours the latest .
neutral	it was more than 00_hours ago and i haven_'_t heard_anything back from them so_far .
neutral	i am thinking of canceling my reservation and dealing_with the hotel_directly .
neutral	update_:
neutral	i just got a call from olotels . com .
neutral	girl on phone was very professional .
neutral	she explained that the rooms with full ocean_view were not available .
neutral	on my opinion if the room is not available it shouldn_'_t be advertised and a worse room shouldn_'_t be sold instead for the same price .
neutral	however , i had to cancel , as i needed a full ocean_view room .
neutral	she promised to cancel my reservation and to refund full_amount within 0 business days .
neutral	shortly i received an_email from olotels . com confirming the cancellation .
neutral	i hope i will get my money back as_promised .
neutral	if everything goes_smoothly i will reconsider my review .
neutral	update 0 :
neutral	i got a full_refund few_days after .
neutral	although the reservation was handled incorrectly by olotels , my further experience with their representative and following refund was positive .
neutral	therefore i '_m raising my rating by one star .
neutral	i get way too many emails and they are all written like essays tl : dr . all the " limited time ", first 000 customers stuff reeks of desperate infomercialism .
neutral	i replaced a hayward navigator that has served me well for 00 years .
neutral	the kreepy krauly is a poor replacement .
neutral	it does not cover my relatively_small pool 00x00 very well .
neutral	i see large patches of dirt on the bottom after several days where the cleaner never vacuumed .
neutral	it is noisy , big and inefficient .
neutral	it fails to pick_up small stones that the navigator ate up easily .
neutral	the dealer , doheny '_s , promised free next_day delivery .
neutral	well , it was free .
neutral	best you read the disclaimer .
neutral	i ordered on the 00th and received it on the 00th .
neutral	it is good most of the time , but occasionally it gets too biased for my taste .
neutral	fuel policy for rental periods very mercenary and inflexible ... only_complaint ,
neutral	cars always good , but unless you intend to circuit the whole of spain , the fuel policy makes rental charge overall punishingly expensive ,... best go the extra for europcar ..
neutral	you are warned ...
neutral	i '_ve used myprotein for a while now and love the products and service they provide , all apart_from the packaging !
neutral	since moving over to the resealable bags , it '_s been a disaster .
neutral	after the first few_days of using the bag , the seal tears away from the bag leaving it completely_useless .
neutral	it '_s such a small thing , but one that really annoys me .
neutral	the product inside is great , and this is the only_thing that lets it down ..... well all apart_from not putting in measuring cups in the smaller supplements , but that '_s another story ;)
neutral	i have been a loyal_customer since opening in this area .
neutral	i was disappointed with the snow_tires recently_purchased for my toyota_corolla .
neutral	i was even more disappointed when the price of the oil_changes went up more_expensive than competitors within the same block .
neutral	i will use competitors for more reasonable prices .
neutral	my costume was great .
neutral	a star_wars storm trooper .
neutral	but seriously , no way to go to the bathroom without taking the whole thing off ?
neutral	this was a $_00 costume that i had to cut my own fly .
neutral	these are pretty good and fast delivery but they shouldn_'_t charge for delivery should be free
neutral	i have shopped with these_guys since a week after the opened their shop on south tay street .
neutral	i refer them to all my mates and always shop there for pc related issues and consumables .
neutral	i built my first pc from a bundle and have gained so much knowledge from these guy '_s .
neutral	there is one thing that troubles me however .
neutral	i handed my lap_top in after a spill and told the small well built man behind the counter that i had opened the machine myself cleaned the mother board but the keyboard was knackered .
neutral	he then told me it would be £_00 or 00 if the screen needed cleaned .
neutral	0 days_later the work was done costing 00 quid .
neutral	they were opened late so i picked_up at 0 pm .
neutral	bob looked a bit tired and i asked_him if this was because the screen was cleaned .
neutral	he looked at the computer and said yes .
neutral	got home and screen was a mess .
neutral	was told it needed replaced to correct .
neutral	i could have paid my house insurance excess of £_000 and had a brand_new one or all the work done by acer but because i trusted these_guys and never had a bad_experience i am now seriously annoyed and to get a screen ( which i was then told by them cannot be cleaned .)
neutral	would be about £_000 plus labour .
neutral	i expect customer service to go up and down in standard as i am a customer service manager with the uk '_s largest retailer .
neutral	it seems to be that the original team dale and the guy '_s still have the vision of what they want .
neutral	they like all other business '_s have # employees who don_'_t give a flying .
neutral	and that is how i felt i was treated .
neutral	i was due to buy a bare bone bundle for my daughters new desktop .
neutral	after so much praise i will be going elsewhere if i can find the price i like in time
neutral	sorry to say this dale but this was a failure .
neutral	i wont even go into the phone_call i had with your laptop specialist and the jargon he hit me with .
neutral	and the fact i told then at the desk the mother board was cleaned by me already .
neutral	new keyboard only all i wanted
neutral	selectspecs were the second internet specs firm i used - i had to return the order from the others they were hopeless .
neutral	perhaps because this was my second go , i had lower expectations , and on that basis they were fine .
neutral	delivery was fairly quick , and the price was good , but they simply can '_t compete with the high_street interms of being_able to handle the specs in person before buying the frames .
neutral	so .
neutral	ok so_far as it goes , but i '_m not sure i '_ll buy internet specs again .
neutral	i got off to a very shaky start when i picked_up the vw_golf at the nice airport .
neutral	after dealing nicely with the agent , i attempted to leave the rental garage , but there was one major problem - the agent did not give me a ticket to place in the machine that opened the gate .
neutral	of course , since there are only two exit gates , this was a major problem for me and many rental_car drivers behind me .
neutral	with no help in sight , i had to run back to the rental_car desk and procure an exit_ticket , this required about 00 - 00_minutes of my time , and also moments of great frustration for me and some fellow eurocar renters .
neutral	also , since this is a very difficult rental_car return location , i think some sort of simple map should be provided .
neutral	ordered a product 00 days ago .
neutral	order acknowledged but not received 00 days_later and no way to check the order status !
neutral	no email of order shipment or way to check on line .
neutral	# fail
neutral	i ordered a calendar , cups and coasters , the order got split so the calendar was on a separate order number actually . anyway the calendar was printed at a lower resolution than i expected so i '_m a little disappointed with it especially as it was the most expensive item , the coasters went missing and the cups get chipped so easily you ' d have to wash them with extreme care , probably separately to keep them good so overall i don_'_t think i ' d use again , i spent just under_£_000 for everything so i think there should be better quality out there , i can '_t actually comment on the quality of the coasters because they still_haven_'_t arrived !
neutral	i ordered two products , and one of them arrived ( as has_been my experience ) in short order .
neutral	however , the other product was simply canceled with no_explanation for the cancellation .
neutral	i would have understood a backorder , but it was canceling the order entirely that baffles and disappoints me .
neutral	your review is excellent .
neutral	the usps that you use for delivery is horrible .
neutral	they made one attempt at delivery to my customer and then returned the package to the " i don " t give a shit bin " at a post_office .
neutral	they left no notice off an attempted delivery .
neutral	my customer started seaching the post_offices of harrisburg , pa . and finally found her package .
neutral	you may save_money using usps , but you ' re losing customers !
neutral	i asked for $_000 , but because i don_'_t sit behind a phone at work i was only able to get $_000 .
neutral	i drive a city bus , i can always be contacted .
neutral	guess if you have a delivery job your considered to perhaps not pay (?)
neutral	otherwise alex was very helpful even_tho it took like half_hour to shuffle papers .
neutral	i '_ll be paying this off quickly .
neutral	they need to use usps as a option to ups , in alot of cases the mail is faster
neutral	die_lieferung wurde für_den 00 . 00 . 00 angegeben , leider kam das paket erst eine woche später !
neutral	the clothes are usually great , however the shipping options and speed ( my order wont ship out for 00 days ) can be a bit of a hassle
neutral	bad service and don_'_t public in my account the invoice for my purchase
neutral	the header pipe i received for my 0000_hyundai accent didn_'_t match the picture .
neutral	( it has a welded on bar & bracket instead of the custom bracket shown ).
neutral	i am happy that you all accept returns , but if it turns_out that it won_'_t fit right after installing , i still have no_idea if you ' d accept that as a return .
neutral	you ' re customer service said " didn_'_t get the msg " 0 days after , then 0 days after sd " we accept returns within 00 days ."
neutral	partsgeek had the best deal on the parts i needed .
neutral	unfortunately , some of their warehouses do not ship to alaska for some reason .
neutral	i had to ship my parts to a freind in the states and then have them ship my parts to me via_usps .
neutral	i do not understand_why partsgeek couldn_'_t do the same thing , all of the major shipping companies ship to alaska .
neutral	customer service is like talking a foreign_language .
neutral	your customer service department needs to be more friendly with your paying customers .
neutral	ordered a key a few_days ago , the game '_s site said it had already been used .
neutral	contacted support , was told to send in a screenshot as proof .
neutral	waited 00h , re - sent the email .. waited another 00h with no response , resent .
neutral	opened a dispute with paypal , 00h later it was " resolved "
neutral	i did receive a refund , but i really just wanted a working key .
neutral	loved the selection , prices and phone support i received when i made an error on my shipping address .
neutral	but i have yet to receive my order or any notice from fed_ex or ups about its whereabouts .
neutral	would love some follow_up .
neutral	hi
neutral	as i run a business it would be great to receive a tax invoice for the purchases i have made for my tax records
neutral	envoi très_rapide , shop très réactif .
neutral	on regrette juste que_les verres se soient rayés entre eux pendant le transport par manque de calfeutrage ...
neutral	honestly i purchased a groupon for ur parking_lot was unable to use because of black out dates the problem i had with that was when i got on your site to make reservations it allowed and accepted the groupon giving me a confirmation of the reservation and the balance due was 0 , 00 i get there and was told the groupon was not allowed !!
neutral	so what i am saying is that it should not have gave_me a receipt accepting the groupon for black out dates stating there was a zero balance due so basically instead of 00 $ it cost me 00 $!
neutral	what happened to my post on 0 / 00 / 0000 ??
neutral	?
neutral	as a 0st time buyer from petflow , i '_m very pleased with their prices and keeping to the shipping schedule by fedex .
neutral	however , petflow should use a heavier grade of box or use more tape to hold the box together .
neutral	one 00 # carton of dry innova food had its bottom coming apart .
neutral	also the expiration_date on the 0 00 # bags and 0 0 # bar treats were just a few_months from expiration ; i like the dates to be into the next year from purchase date , that way i know the food is fresh and keeps its flavor .
neutral	the 0 cases of can evo food had an expiration_date well into 0000 which was fine .
neutral	but 0 cans in one case were crushed ; i don_'_t know if it came from petflow that way or it happened during fedex shipping .
neutral	on both boxes the tape broke going over the sides of the boxes .
neutral	in any event , i will give petflow another chance in several months .
neutral	cannot_comment on satisfaction until i experience the actual service in january_0000 .
neutral	okay so i hit the button and watch the speedo go up and down and up and down - then again for the upload speed ( getting boring .
neutral	.
neutral	. )
neutral	and it '_s done .
neutral	i get two numbers and a list of providers and contracts .
neutral	my download is 00 mbps and the upload ( does it matter for ebay ) is lower .
neutral	is that good or bad ( even ugly ) or just average .
neutral	we men are in that state of questioning from puberty so you just added to my angsts .
neutral	relief please !
neutral	tell me wtf it means !!
neutral	otherwise yada yada yada it seemed to work fine !
neutral	you kept me entertained in the time it took for me to reach 00 mbps .
neutral	how was it for you ?
neutral	though overpriced , the filters were delivered quickly and on time .
neutral	service from superdry is very good , have never had a bad customer service experience .
neutral	only problem is i spend more sending items back ... what is going on with there sizes ?
neutral	i bought a barbour quilted_jacket in a medium instead - this coat in an xl was still to small !
neutral	i order prescription food for my dog every 0 - 0 months .
neutral	after i place the order , i send the email with the original prescription attached and even doing this , petflow takes more than 0 days to look at it .
neutral	i called customer service twice and they still have not seen / validated the prescription .
neutral	disappoint credit_scores are only updated quarterly .
neutral	it '_s too early to comment on tires , however the customer service aspect of the purchase was less_than stellar .
neutral	i went to the store the day after independence day with downloaded information for tired i wanted for both my cars .
neutral	the csr was very curt to the previous customer .
neutral	as i approached , to explain what i wanted and handed the sheets for both cars .
neutral	i purchased tires and had a couple repairs at that store but hd no record of my wife or myself .
neutral	the tires i wanted for both vehicles had to be ordered .
neutral	we check the car on saturday , and scheduled an_appointment for monday at five pm .
neutral	i arrived 00_minutes early , we had to walk around the car again today , why ?
neutral	we did this .
neutral	so it was 0 : 00 before i left .
neutral	i asked that passenger rear be saved so i would have one , in the event of a problem with the spare , well no tire in car .
neutral	when i checked when i arrived home .
neutral	not to happy , since it was on my receipt .
neutral	well we '_ll found out how round two goes tomorrow .
neutral	with the elantra 0 tires and an alignment just like today .
neutral	the csr area could use some help as people wait way too_long to be helped .
neutral	you sign your rights away on this website if you read the terms and conditions .
neutral	won_'_t be posting again
neutral	i had 0 orders , 0 prescription & 0 non prescription .
neutral	the latter arrived within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	the prescription one took_longer , an online_chat / help produced no response .
neutral	a 0pm telephone_call asking why it is taking so long to deliver ( 0days ) resulted_in a delivery the next_day .
neutral	the online prescription is a bit flaky too .
neutral	i decided to give details of my doctor ( optional ) and although all the details were filled in and correct it kept asking for the surgery details so would not let_me proceed .
neutral	i did not give details in the end
neutral	i booked a smart for 0 , but got a citroen_c0 , which is really a very very basic car .
neutral	one of the cheap kind .
neutral	the radio was not working , so we had no music .
neutral	but the booking and the car return went easy .
neutral	very good quality parts quick lots of contact ie dispatch and order recieved the only_thing i would say is the website needs alot of work parts are really hard to find on there end up having to ring up most of the time
neutral	i receivee the packet on time as promissed , but the cover of the book had a slash / cut on it .
neutral	i purchased an olympic a barbell set which arrived yesterday .
neutral	the product itself looks_like good quality so no complaint there .
neutral	however my experience was soured by the attitude of customer service staff and the carrier they employ when my order didn_'_t arrive between the time they said it would .
neutral	it wasn_'_t too_late when it arrived but the point was when i rang the carrier told me he had delivery down as being 0pm as_opposed to before 00pm , so my initial reaction was half my day had been wasted and my time , like theirs , is money and when i pointed this out to the customer service team the reaction i got sounded quite aggressive and the call back from someone higher up i was told i would get never came .
neutral	the attitude of the carrier company was also arrogant and disinterested , like he was doing me the favour !
neutral	the customer service team and the carrier service need to remind themselves that it '_s the customer that keeps them in jobs .
neutral	goods website and booking went fine my only problem was that i booked a twin_room and ended_up with a double .
neutral	alpharooms told the hotel double .
neutral	i have been in touch with alpharooms and to be far they have been very helpful .
neutral	however they have tried to say that i thought i was going to get two rooms , but i didn_'_t expect this i expected two beds in one room ( a twin_room ?!)
neutral	but alpharooms say that " a twin_room is a double occupancy room which is what you received ."
neutral	yes got a double occupancy room but it was a double_bed which i had to share with a friend and although we know each other very well , and are good friends we didn_'_t particularly want to sleep in the same bed !
neutral	although it has_been the source of much merriment to our fellow travelling companions .
neutral	so beware if you book a twin_room with alpharooms you could end up in a double_bed ....
neutral	the employees in this store work in slow motion .
neutral	although they are courteous the management doesn_'_t seem to care if the service techs walk and act like they are half a sleep .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	i sent it back today because it was the wrong part . i ordered a right rear_tail_lamp lens and received the left_side which is holding me up to finish the job .
neutral	and now i had to pay $ 0 . 00 for shipping due to your mistake .
neutral	i want the right side .
neutral	you should receive the return soon . please rush the right part to me
neutral	i bought a gbp 00 playstation 0 card , and it cost over $_00 .
neutral	with the current exchange_rates this is not really something that i would like to see .
neutral	i will not purchase again until the price is lowered .
neutral	when reviewing some sites , you can see obvious bogus ratings and ratings from other_sites which aren_'_t explained or anything .
neutral	this gives a very unprofessional feeling about the site .
neutral	combining this with the lack of users that write more than 0 review , it doesn_'_t make me feel_like this is a site i ' d recommend to other people .
neutral	on the other hand , the site has a pretty good looking but simple layout .
neutral	great game , but the company censors bad posts on their forums and tends not to listen to their ( paying ) users when it comes to deleting or adding content .
neutral	i brought 0 games on the friday before_xmas , and paid the extra for next working day delivery , i didn_'_t expect it to be delivered on xmas_eve but i thought i ' d give it a try , i then got an_email from shop to telling_me it would arrive on the 00th_dec , i waited in all day and it didn_'_t arrive , bit_annoying cos i was going to try to get one of the games on xms eve .
neutral	the games didn_'_t arrive until the 00th .
neutral	didn_'_t even get and apologie for the delay , or offer to refund the charge !
neutral	not sure if shop to are to blame or dpd , but don_'_t say your going to deliver when you can '_t guarantee !
neutral	i ordered a flower_arrangement for my wife that included yellow roses among others .
neutral	all of the flowers seemed fresh except for the 0 dozen yellow roses .
neutral	the outside three rings of petals were wilted and brown .
neutral	i know that roses usual require the removal of the outside ring of petals for optimal display , but this was disappointing .
neutral	also , i ordered one of the optional vases suggested for the arrangement .
neutral	when the vase arrived with the flowers , it was too small to place the arrangement in .
neutral	seems that this is a glitch in the ordering system -- i should not have been offered a vase that would not fit the arrangement ordered .
neutral	otherwise , the ordering was straightforward and the flowers were delivered when promised .
neutral	i tempi_di_spedizione hanno rispettato quanto scritto .
neutral	0 giorni inclusi sabato e domenica .
neutral	purtroppo avevo ordinato una cintura gucci misura 000 e mi e stata consegnata 000 !
neutral	x pigrizia ho risolto applicando 0 fori .
neutral	non e ' stata una bella sorpresa .
neutral	very easy to use and book but beware -, all booking are subject to a mandatory booking_fee of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	this is out of kilter with recent guidelines on booking air travel and just makes the car parking look outdated and sneaky .
neutral	ordered the wrong part from partsgeek .
neutral	the delivery was fast the box had been opened and resealed .
neutral	i needed to return the part for the correct one so i followed their instructions to get a return number .
neutral	that was three_weeks_ago and i haven_'_t heard a thing .
neutral	also their policy of not paying the shipping even if a mistake was made and it was their fault is really bad customer_relations .
neutral	i will now have to call .
neutral	its a plain_white eton shirt so there is not much to say .
neutral	ordered at 0pm , not dispatched until 0 . 00pm the next_day .
neutral	thats a two day wait for delivery - not bad , but not good either .
neutral	to be fair though the price was as good as you would get anywhere .
neutral	products arrived as_described but not next_day as_advertised .
neutral	staff answered the phone promptly but appeared to have very little training or knowledge of products .
neutral	if this can be improved it would go along way !
neutral	i have bought a lot of stuff from heinnie_haynes over the years - they have excellent customer service and efficient delivery , however some of their products are really overpriced and not up to the job , there are a lot of toys in amongst the good gear .
neutral	it is better if you have handled the stuff elsewhere before you part with your money .
neutral	pictires of hotel very deceiving .
neutral	could have booked the room cheaper thru_travelocity .
neutral	however i did not really have a bad_experience using hotels one . com .
neutral	would consider_using them again .
neutral	items ordered are shipped promptly and usually packed very well , returning items is a bit of a hassle with time delays via the internet system , refunds take quite_awhile , other then that the parts are good quality and fit well .
neutral	i like the availability of all the products , even hard to find ones .
neutral	but , i recently purchases a gasket that cost $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the shipping was $ 0 . 00 !
neutral	and that was the cheapest choice .
neutral	the gasket was about 0x0 inches and could have weighted more then an ounce or two .
neutral	so long carried the preparation for a shipment by partsgeek .
neutral	our computer desk was delivered promptly and we were kept_informed of the estimated time for arrival .
neutral	i asked the delivery guys to leave it in the hall so we could unpack it ourselves , i did not appreciate just how heavy it was .
neutral	on reflection i should have let the delivery guys move it to the appropriate room .
neutral	we spent the next week with it stuck in a doorway where we had managed to drag it , until we could get help to stand it on end to get it through a door way .
neutral	this would have been a better experience if the delivery guys had been able to use those plastic shoe covers , then i would not have minded them walking on my cream carpet .
neutral	buyers should note that they are not allowed to remove their shoes for health and safety_reasons !
neutral	nor do they unwrap , so you are stuck with the substantial packaging to dispose of .
neutral	so , it is now in place and we are pleased with it , but i would think very carefully about
neutral	purchasing anything_else .

neutral	noticed the lack of passengers both_ways , far below the levels when i travelled same route when it was <_external link_removed >.
neutral	i felt somewhat conned by the fact that the original cost quoted was about 00 euro less_than i actually had to pay !.
neutral	this i know is a <_external link_removed_> type of thing to do but when will an airline just quote a price and be done with it .
neutral	in another words the price you see first on the web_page will be the one you pay .!
neutral	was not able to find a quick way to the departure gate - domestic flight and subsequently had to queue up with international passengers which took half an_hour . fortunately i had the time .
neutral	maybe this facility no_longer exists , if it does exist the hostess at the check in desk should point it out !
neutral	good buy but not the required weight , suggest look_elsewhere
neutral	this time the delivery came very quickly but last winter i ran_out completely and was without oil for a week because the oil conpany had drivers off sick and a broken down lorry
neutral	high_quality signal , good customer service , but very inflexible and will not match other mobile carriers deals .
neutral	so have reluctantly move to vodafone for my iphone .
neutral	i am impressed because people i manage to connect , especially , in nigeria , can hear me very clearly and vice_versa .
neutral	but sometimes i have the problem that i hear them without them hearing me .
neutral	the connecting tome is a bit_longer_than normal .
neutral	i think the connecting charge is a bit higher considering that uone has to pay vat for recharging .
neutral	meanwhile , i '_ll keep on using it until we have a better offer .
neutral	the only problem i have with partsgeek is being in the parts business in my early years i have always talked or communicated with a live_person and problems where resolved quickly , i '_ve been waiting almost 00 days to get a returned handeled so i could re - order the correct part .
neutral	my wife does not understand_why it '_s taking so long as do i wonder ???
neutral	this is my first return with partsgeek and i hope it never happens again as this is a nightmare , when it could be so easy ..
neutral	people were great but the unit i had , which was one of the largest , was difficult to get to and even more difficult to get out of the property .
neutral	no place to dispose of recyclable cardboard even_though they had a large container on site that was chained and not accessible .
neutral	stupid way
neutral	good selection and good prices .
neutral	items were shipped much later than they were supposed to be .
neutral	took around a month to get both my pairs .
neutral	customer service were unfriendly east indians who were very unhelpful .
neutral	slow to despatch
neutral	ordered some parts through parts_geek and thought it was going to take a long time to get my parts because it was the thanksgiving 0 - day holiday .
neutral	i thought i would go with my bronco for a lot longer waiting for the water_pump gaskets , but they arrived a lot sooner_than the estimated delivery date .
neutral	one thing that bothers_me some is that i ordered several gaskets that is needed for my water_pump assembly .
neutral	when i added them to my on line shopping_cart , it showed that the gaskets were in 0 differnent warehouses , and i was charged $ 0 . 00 for gaskets from each warehouses which in total was $_00 . 00 .
neutral	now , i would think these gaskets for the water_pump would be in the same place , and since they all came in the same box , i should have only paid $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i looked up one company , with whom i had what must be a common bad_experience , and saw mostly 0_stars or 0_star .
neutral	the 0_star reviews were often short and generic , came during a relatively_short_period of time following bad_reviews , and the reviewer had only one review here .
neutral	what would motivate those 0_star individual ( s )?
neutral	my question : do you screen these types of reviews , whereby a company might polish their image ?
neutral	if so , how ?
neutral	do you look at the ip_address ?
neutral	we need to trust your data , please .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	please explain your deals with businesses : 0 ) take control of your online image .
neutral	generate a regular flow of reviews from genuine customers automatically with trustpilot business .
neutral	it requires no special software , just a single email .
neutral	0 ) display independent reviews and create trust 00_% of online shoppers use customer reviews in their decision_making process ( yougov 0000 ).
neutral	by displaying positive_reviews on your site through trustpilot , you give them the reassurance they need to complete their purchase .
neutral	the price was the best i could find .
neutral	compared to other online_retailers , the delivery time was too_long .
neutral	if i need an auto part i usually need it right_away , not a week and a half later .
neutral	also , the tone of the emails did not seem directed at excellent customer service .
neutral	they sounded_like a list of excuses so if a customer complains , the company can say " i told you so ".
neutral	the order confirmation_email , the first email i received , did not mention the part i ordered , which made me wonder_if i actually ordered the part or i had been scammed out of my money .
neutral	the part is scheduled for delivery tomorrow , 00 days after the order .
neutral	once i received a tracking_number for the shipping it still took almost 00 days to receive my package .
neutral	very happy with the service i got picking out tires and reviewing the services with hunani but the actual service was slow , almost 0 hours to put on 0 tires and i had made an_appointment ahead of time to come in .
neutral	sometimes delivery is prompt other times it is not
neutral	i ordered the wrong part due to ( imo ) a poorly organized web catalogue with ambiguous descriptions and multiple descriptions of the same product ( s ) - ( hood / trunk lift support pistons ).
neutral	part arrived on time , wrong version .
neutral	that '_s when the fun starts .
neutral	you will never be able to talk to a human so don_'_t bother attempting to call partsgeek .
neutral	all transactions are handled via_e_-_mail .
neutral	though i eventually was able to return my part , it was at my own_expense , and it took several days for each e_-_mail exchange .
neutral	i returned my part and went to knecht '_s instead .
neutral	i was able to see the part prior to purchase , and the price is the same or a little less , with no shipping , and the convenience of driving to the store to exchange or return if needed with the only shipping expense being my gas .
neutral	my advice , check knechts before you buy anything from partsgeek .
neutral	sorry guys - you asked for my honest_opinion .
neutral	checkin in at landvetter , gothenburg worked very well , but when we were checking in at munchen it was not possible to do it in the machines at the terminal .
neutral	we didn_'_t get any notification to check in online and were not able to .
neutral	pure luck that we got the chance to sit beside each other
neutral	when i am buying something on - line , i don_'_t want pop - up ads trying to sell me other products .
neutral	i know what i want and i just want to buy them and move on to other things i need to do .
neutral	when i am asked if i want to schedule automatic deliveries , i don_'_t mind saying no once , but being asked a second time " if i am really sure , last chance " is really annoying .
neutral	i don_'_t want to have to say the same thing twice every time i check out .
neutral	because of these selling techniques , unless i am getting a really great price , i choose other_vendors that let_me find what i want and check out with minimal_hassle .
neutral	delivery was made on time as_promised .
neutral	the delivery driver wanted to leave the pallet on the street .
neutral	he wasn_'_t helpful when asked to bring the delivery into the building ( a metre from the street !)
neutral	the rubber mallet that was ordered was missing .
neutral	i was told this happens often with deliveries as they are attached to the outside of the packaging .
neutral	perhaps if that '_s the case they ought to be packed differently ?
neutral	i was told i would have a refund made for the missing item .
neutral	not surprisingly , i '_m still_waiting .....
neutral	sink was nice and in good condition .
neutral	price was right .
neutral	a cutting board was included with the sink but not properly_packaged and damaged .
neutral	contacted support about the issue and never received a response .
neutral	problem has not been corrected
neutral	i liked the shopping_experience and the friendly staff but there have been a few issues with the quality of the furniture .
neutral	so_far , there haven_'_t been any_issues trying to rectify this but i think some extra investment in the quality control processes would save them money as they wouldn_'_t need to rectify issues and would save me time chasing up the issues .
neutral	some of the furniture is really lovely , it is just a shame that not all of it was of the same quality first time round .
neutral	i '_m totally_satisfied with the pink gumpos you sent ... however , because of the cold_weather we were expecting , i asked to have the shipment delayed one week .
neutral	it didn_'_t happen .
neutral	small thing to you , i '_m sure .
neutral	i wish you all did ( or could or would ) listen .
neutral	it will affect any purchases i might make in the future .
neutral	booking my reservation was easy however it was very distractive and busy at the company end .
neutral	it was at times hard for him to hear me as well as me hearing him .
neutral	a prime_example is my name is not michael it is michele .
neutral	i do hope that this will not interfere with our reservations once we get to the hotel .
neutral	overall the person on the other end i think his_name was louey was friendly and helpful .
neutral	ordered two parts , one sent to me and recived very fast and was right part .
neutral	second sent by uspo recived two_days_later than first part .
neutral	was wrong part .
neutral	pretty cheap but the grabbing f # ckrs can only apply level 0 or 0 cover to whole trip or not at all and cover cant be extended once away .
neutral	whole bunch of get out clauses for them too .
neutral	the company this lot took over from were much_better , friendlier , clearer about product , better website and much more tailored to backpack market .
neutral	if you can find somethi ng else at this price i ' d go there instead ...
neutral	somehow delivery . com can_afford to give out $ 0 off deals all the time , but it '_s often difficult to get the deal to be accepted once logging in -- even from the deal email .
neutral	the interface issues don_'_t end there .
neutral	the search is faulty , and even when it does work , your selection of restaurants is pretty limited compared to what seamless offers .
neutral	but , $ 0 off is hard to beat .
neutral	i basically go to delivery . com if they ' re offering a deal , and seamless . com if delivery is not .
neutral	i like the services , part was received in good condition , and correct .
neutral	no installation_instructions , had to have it adjusted by a mechanic ($).
neutral	worse was the screws were wrong_size .
neutral	i had to scramble , with my car down , for the correct size screws .
neutral	i took_longer to find screws than to install part .
neutral	delivered to wrong house wrong street by ups .
neutral	luckily my reg .
neutral	mailman reconised my nane and del .
neutral	to right house .
neutral	most places with core_charge items come with a return shipping_label with the product to send it straight back with ease , might be something to think about .
neutral	ordered a taillight .. ok
neutral	ink seems ok but delivery took more than a week .
neutral	we ' d been told that our booking had been taken up by a different driver to the one whose number we ' d been given , and that this new driver would call .
neutral	we didn_'_t have that number , so had no - one to call to say we ' d be late arriving at the airport .
neutral	there was no - one there when we arrived .
neutral	we had arrived 00_mins_later than planned , and we were only met a further 00_mins_later by a driver after several calls to the central switchboard .
neutral	this was quite stressful - we were late , it was cold , and we started wishing we ' d paid long - stay .
neutral	however , this did appear to be a one - off oversight , and the service on return was excellent .
neutral	this experience would not put me off using this company again in the future .
neutral	i clicked on the cheapest insurance and opted to remove the posted documentation to reduce the cost further .
neutral	when the confirmation e_-_mail arrived i had been charged almost e00 more than i selected .
neutral	extremely fast delivery to germany .
neutral	!
neutral	often even faster_than germany to germany inland shipping .
neutral	but no more exceptional prices .
neutral	( which had made bulkpowders . co . uk so famous .)
neutral	most of these products can i get in eu / germany for the same / similar price ...
neutral	... you just have to look for .
neutral	[ 0_stars ]
neutral	product is great but service and shipping s slower_than a dead snail .
neutral	both_times i have used your service it was over a month before i received my package .
neutral	to me , that is unacceptable for the price of the product .
neutral	unlikely to buy . again if it remains this way .
neutral	0 * for the products but please stop using yodel .
neutral	delivery any time of day up to 0pm , nothing happened but when i checked the yodel website it said delivery attempted at 0 . 00pm , note left .
neutral	not true .
neutral	luckily caught them the next_day , not very convincing excuse claiming not to know what had been put on the website .
neutral	other_companies can manage 0 hour delivery slots , please procook change your delivery contract !
neutral	martin
neutral	good web - site will evauate shiping later
neutral	can '_t complain_about prices or ease of ordering but no information provided about my delivery has meant that i '_ve had to call them for an update and even now i '_m still in the dark over specific delivery times ... could do better ...
neutral	hi , i have been trying to get in touch with parts_geek . i have filled_out the submit ticket three_times , but it wont take it , please_let_me know what to do .
neutral	ordered on the 00st of may and it is now the 00th of june and i am still_waiting on my game .
neutral	i have to wait 00 working days to put in a claim , just as well its not a present .
neutral	initially did a small transaction - which worked well .
neutral	then after a positive_experience wanted to increase my spend but was blocked due to a low daily_limit ?
neutral	sorry guys
neutral	went elsewhere - same thing no limits
neutral	like the tires , didn_'_t appreciate all the non_- disclosed charges
neutral	when we arrived the first salesman was terrible .
neutral	left us sitting for hours .
neutral	not very informative or knowledgeable .
neutral	nathan came over to help us get things moving .
neutral	he was amazing .
neutral	however ... going by sticker prices on our very large purchase ... our total before taxes should have been roughly 0000 . 00 .
neutral	the computer was charging 0000 . 00 and that was with them giving us 0000 . 00 off ... we again waited for about an_hour to get that corrected .
neutral	nathan did his best to keep us comfortable and happy while waiting ... it was almost 00_degrees in there .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for nathan ... we would have left and went elsewhere .
neutral	we will come_back for another large purchase in a week or so .
neutral	we ' d used stress_free parking on a previous trip and we ' re reasonably pleased with the way it worked so we thought we ' d use them again prior to our catching our flight to tunisia .
neutral	the biggest problem we had was trying to understand what the chap on the phone line was trying to tell us when we were making our call just 00_mins away from the airport .
neutral	his english was appalling .
neutral	as a result we misheard where exactly the meet &_greet point was and ending up doing another ' circuit ' around the airport .
neutral	we rang again while doing the circuit and spoke to someone_else who '_s english was much_better - at_least we understood him , but by then we were already starting to get a little stressed !
neutral	the return leg was much_better .
neutral	call was made straight after we collected our_luggage and the car was waiting for us , therefore no delays at all .
neutral	would i use them a 0rd time ?
neutral	probably .
neutral	i ordered some sip phones and after week of not being shipped tried to canceled them , but they said was already shipped however no tracking_number was provided .
neutral	we recently_purchased an afk arbour and were delighted with the price and no delivery charge from gardenbest buys .
neutral	however the delivery date came and went without_any contact from garden best buys .
neutral	after phone_call and email , we found out that the product had not been delivered to gbb by afk as they only deliver full pallets .
neutral	consequently we had to wait another week .
neutral	although promised a phone_call to advise us of the actual delivery date and time , we arrived home one day to find that the freight company had tried to deliver the product while we were out .
neutral	however , after a further phone_call they did deliver later that same day .
neutral	the arbour is not as high a quality as we expected but the for the price isn_'_t bad .
neutral	one crucial nut missing from the pack , and some of the wood cracked .
neutral	( couldn_'_t bear to send it back after the wait !)
neutral	however it only took an_hour to build and looks good .
neutral	tina from garden best buys was very helpful .
neutral	i like the product and the fact i can customize pictures , but the fact that i am limiited to 000 words on a card makes little sense to me .
neutral	i wanted to write a poem but was ubable to put it on the card .
neutral	also , something wrong with the fed_ex option , no matter what , i was unable to do it , forcing me to start over every time , time_consuming , but the usps option works_fine .
neutral	your price was not the bottom_line .
neutral	end of discussion .
neutral	good service .
neutral	better price than most .
neutral	email_confirmations and contact could be better .
neutral	delivery times could be shorter .
neutral	ordered a hob .
neutral	was out of stock .
neutral	advised to call back later .
neutral	waited a week , called again .
neutral	told 0_weeks wait .
neutral	requested to cancel order and sent e_-_mail .
neutral	two_days_later still no refund on credit_card .
neutral	next_day i was called saying the hob was in stock ,.
neutral	by then i had found another supplier .
neutral	asked if my order was cancelled , because i had already requested that and was told " no ".
neutral	requested it be cancelled and got e_-_mail confirming this and the refund came through two_days_later .
neutral	need to get that service right and provide better information and processing .
neutral	staff helpful and willing , but that is not enough .
neutral	fantastic products at fantastic prices , would definately buy from them again .
neutral	only challenge was it took 00 days for my package to arrive rather_than the 0 i was expecting .
neutral	i am very satisfied with the overall experience .
neutral	it was a lengthy process due to language_barrier .
neutral	once i got the right person it was a wonderful experien .
neutral	very excited about our upcoming_trip .
neutral	to early for up sell attempt , especially when couldn_'_t deliver full product on time .
neutral	also now i get way too many emails from you .
neutral	your asked to do a product review for a $_00 . 00 coupon_code by email .
neutral	so you take the time to do the review thinking your getting a $_00 . 00 reward and after_submitting it and getting a email with a coupon_code for $_00 . 00 off your next order ( here is the kicker ) over $_000 . 00 !
neutral	what about the customer who doesn_'_t need to spend $_000 . 00 dollars at shot .
neutral	thx .
neutral	i was quoted us $_000 with no additional_fees when i reserved the car on the internet , but with taxes and being charged for a full_tank of gas at their price it came out to about us $_000 total .
neutral	i was expecting it to be pay for the full_tank after i read other reviews , but that was a lot more !
neutral	overall the experience was not bad though .
neutral	after several heated e_mails ( on my part ) partsgeek came through and refunded my entire order .
neutral	i still believe it would better serve them to talk to their customers rather_than just by e_-_mail , but i am old_school .
neutral	i seriously had my doubts_about this site and weather i was going to recieve my order .
neutral	i ordered an iphone clone ( hero h0000 ), 0 pairs of fake apple earphones , and a lazer pointer .
neutral	after payment is made , you get a confirmation_email_stating that the order will be shipped within 0 days .
neutral	i thought wow , no one told me about this !
neutral	as i had ordered express shipping for $_00 extra .
neutral	so on the 0th day i still had not recieved my products i think oh no i just got scammed of $_000 .
neutral	i send them an_email explaing what has happened .
neutral	after this they tell me that it is out of stock , when on the site it says in stock .
neutral	oh well .. i wait a week and email again , now seriously worried if my package will ever come .
neutral	support sends me something completely random about texting someone and that i should wait a few more days .
neutral	after waiting 0 days i recieve an_email with a tracking_number plus my shipping info .
neutral	i am very relieved at this point because now theres a greater chance it will arrive , and so it did .
neutral	they pacakaged everything into the phone box which i found incredibly odd .
neutral	the phone comes with 0 batteries and a european / us charger however the us adapter was broken so useless for me , thankfully it is a usb and i used my ipod charger .
neutral	earphones only fit this phone and they were also broken .
neutral	the lazer i got was also broken , and came with no batteries .
neutral	earphones get uncomfortable if worn for more than 00_mins , sound avarage , but they look almost exactly like the original .
neutral	overall experiance is that dont expect great quality , you get what you pay for .
neutral	however this is not a scam site and i did recive my products to the right price .
neutral	the part was cheap and packaged poorly .
neutral	box was severely_damaged when it arrived but part was still intact and fine .
neutral	no real complaints seeing how the entire thing only cost around twenty_dollars .
neutral	got my part over a week late due to it getting sent to ca when i live in ia when i did get the part your customer service told me they had it sent back to them and they would refund me yet i got the part in the mail that same day .
neutral	because the confusion i won_'_t be using this company in the future .
neutral	however the customer service was very fast at tracking the part for me and responding to all my emails i got my part in the end better late then never .
neutral	when you ship something that easy broke make_sure use double box ,,, i receive the mirror but it broke on the corner ,,,, what can i tell with my customer ???
neutral	second thing ,,, when you receive the complaint ,, you must tell the buyer how to do ,,, like you will receive full_refund or we will send you another one replacement .
neutral	in this case the buyer know how to decide to buy another one from somewhere_else or wait for return or wait for another replacement .
neutral	i got email from july 0 that said " you will receive an_rma e_-_mail with complete return instructions in approximately 00 - 00_hours " but until now , i didn_'_t receive any email yet ????
neutral	before i buy from your website because it ships fast even expensive than ebay .
neutral	but until now , i will think again
neutral	inexpensive parts yes , but you '_ll never get anyone on the phone in case of a problem .
neutral	they ship items at different times and show the order as delivered in full when still incomplete , not good .
neutral	they should have a shipping tracking_number per shipment not order !
neutral	i am a huge_fan of most of the services identity_guard provides .
neutral	the scores seem to be nearly identical to the ones that the banks have pulled which is incredibly important .
neutral	some sites , and i have tried most of them , will be as much as 00 points off what the banks pull .
neutral	that is obviously not helpful .
neutral	i do have a couple of things that are frustrating however .
neutral	they only let you pull your credit_reports once a quarter .
neutral	many sites let you pull it once a month .
neutral	quarterly is not often enough with the way your score can change so quickly .
neutral	it also doesn_'_t seem to tell you when you can pull it again other than to say " quarterly ".
neutral	that '_s great but ...... quarterly by calendar year or every three months from when i started ?
neutral	however , they are quick to allow you to pay to purchase more bureaus .
neutral	it also seems that they double charge me occationally .
neutral	i need to check to validate that statement as i may be incorrect .
neutral	so , in conclusion , the scores are very accurate compared with my bank pulls for refinancing my mortgage .
neutral	the analyser feature is great to help you predict where you score will be based on certain scenarios .
neutral	however , they need to allow you to get your reports monthly and make the information of when it is available again more obvious .
neutral	also , i forgot to mention it is nice to get the notifications when there is something new posted to you credit .
neutral	i am satisfied with merchant cash and capital .
neutral	i only have two issues .
neutral	i never received an endorsed copy of the agreement signed by merchant cash and capital .
neutral	the second thing is that $_00 , 000 was deposited in my checking account but the loan and paperwork was for $_00 , 000 .
neutral	your response is appreciated .
neutral	regards ,
neutral	kenneth moore
neutral	i bought a pair of ultegra pedals .
neutral	i was happy with the price and the delivery time was brilliant although i felt a bit let_down that they are actually oe spec .
neutral	pedals and so didn_'_t come with the box .
neutral	i think this should have been mentioned up - front because i wanted to give the pedals as a gift and instead have kept them for myself and bought a second set as the gift from a bike shop ( with the box ).
neutral	i ordered stereo knobs and there were 0 in the pic and 0 when i received them .
neutral	just letting you know .
neutral	let_me know if you want the specifics .

neutral	items ordered in the past have always arrived quickly .
neutral	this time , tracking the item , it was at the cleveland location on tuesday_morning but ups opted to wait to put it on the truck until thursday .
neutral	no_issues with your company .
neutral	just the issue with ups .
neutral	für_die größe der schrauben waren die löcher zweimal nicht groß genug gefräst .
neutral	wir mussten zweimal neue schrauben besorgen , dadurch haben_wir den ganzen nachmittag gebraucht zum aufbauen .
neutral	was very easy to get the car booked , and they were very helpful when i attempted to change the reservation .
neutral	however i was not able to cancel anything once in europe and the prices for changes seemed a little higher_than other_places online , and especially higher_than bargaining with the hertz person at the counter in zurich .
neutral	its a matter of luck , sometimes you get cards very fast and almost always it takes them more than their " guaranteed " delivery time , also sometimes the card has already been activated and although they make it right , you spend a day or two waiting and exchanging emails .
neutral	wanted to gift some game time to a friend .
neutral	tried to send it to multiple e_-_mail addresses and it never arrived .
neutral	had to screenshot the page and send that to a friend .
neutral	when i realised that it was marginally less_expensive to get contact_lenses from an internet supplier , i googled " cheap lenses " and lenshop , or whatever , came up .
neutral	i bought some and they arrived , so naturally i was delighted .
neutral	i never got a shipping confirmation online or email .
neutral	i had to call to find out if it shipped .
neutral	no i don_'_t know if it arrived .
neutral	i '_m glad i found " giftcards . com " for the conveinence .
neutral	but the delivery of the gift_card took way too_long to arrive .
neutral	on may_00th i ordered my teraflex front_rotors upgrade kit .
neutral	( order #_0000000 ).
neutral	i then the next_day placed an order for my rear_rotors .
neutral	about a week_later i received my rear_rotors but not the fronts .
neutral	the day after receiving my rear_rotors , i received an_email_stating that the front_rotors are on back order for at_least another 0_weeks .
neutral	in all honesty i would have ordered them from a different company had i known that this item was not in stock .
neutral	i had to order the pads from a different company due to the fact that the ones on 0wd were labeled one kind of pad and looking at the part number it was a completely different pad .
neutral	when i called no one could figure_out which one it truly was so i went to quadratec instead and got them a few dollars cheaper .
neutral	at the end of the day though i am still_waiting for the rotors and unable to drive my jeep because of this delay .
neutral	does as it said on the tin .. just a bit_slow
neutral	i have no_hesitation in recommending the products whatsoever - twice though , i have had bad_experience with delivery - the last of which took over a week to arrive via yodel - the order was intact , but the jiffy_bag looked like it had done twelve rounds with mike tyson - i won_'_t be choosing the yodel option for delivery ever again .
neutral	the price of my tyres dropped by £_00 each between order and fitting , it cost me £_00 to cancel the order and re - order the same but still saved £_00 on the 0 by doing so .
neutral	have just bought the above tent .
neutral	great size and couloir easier to set_up .
neutral	however highly disappointed have nearly spent £ 0000 that the stitching was over the side door so had to cut it .
neutral	also the black trim around the front of the tent entrance has lost both the pegging points .
neutral	both fell_off before i even got a peg near them .
neutral	not impressed at all .
neutral	prices are good but shipping is to slow .
neutral	i had to wait two_weeks to get my books and when students order them first day of class they need them no later than that week .
neutral	they need a real_person for returns and an easy to find phone_number .
neutral	seriously , someone at 00 bucks an_hour ... come on ..
neutral	i nevcer heard of dyers before this order .
neutral	i placed my order withdometic but somehow it was fullfilled by dyers . i would have liked more technical information on the product because after it arrived i realized it did not apply to my model / year of air_conditioner .. so now i guess i '_m stuck with the stuff .
neutral	the prices are great but god_forbid you need help or have a return .
neutral	i wish i could speak to a real_person to have them explain_why i cannot get the part i want .
neutral	i refused shipment because the box was open and it was not the part i needed .
neutral	not certain where the fault lies but cannot get anyone to answer my requests for information on my first order .
neutral	second order came through fine .
neutral	all i want is the correct part for the car .
neutral	i ordered a guitar for my child hoping to have it in time for christmas .
neutral	the site said i would get it in plenty of time as did the confirmation_email .
neutral	not only did it not arrive it never shipped on time .
neutral	once we got it , it was great , but poor service on the shipping end .
neutral	i order a lot of stuff on the internet , parts_geek shipping is very slow compared to others .
neutral	if waiting at_least a week is not a problem then buy from these_guys
neutral	i was in the process of ordering parts .
neutral	my cart was loaded and i was ready to check out .
neutral	imagine my surprise when during checkout one of my parts suddenly changed price .
neutral	i tried to call stockwise but you have to leave a message , which will then be " digitally transcribed to text and emailed to support ", and if whoever gets the email is actually able to read what you spoke and thinks that your question is worthy of a call back than they will call you at their leisure ... seriously ?
neutral	what the heck is that about ?
neutral	to top it all off , i never received a phone_call back .
neutral	i will shop somewhere_else and pay slightly more for reliable prices and support when i need it .
neutral	still_awaiting the part after 00 days .
neutral	the part was shipped via_ups_ground .
neutral	small part could have easily been shipped first_class mail and been here in 0 days .
neutral	very much not happy with ups right due to this shipment and others .
neutral	as far as part geeks they did have a hard to find part at a good price .
neutral	trust me the g0 millerain in choco is quality ... but ... when u also order the blue one and it '_s out of stock despite it being shown as in stock on the website i felt slightly gutted ..... the website took ages to update the stock_levels which might have also upset other baracuta fans like me ...... it leaves a bad_taste !
neutral	!
neutral	website is easy to use and pay for items but was told my items would be delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 , and they are late which i am unhappy about as i ordered them specifically so they would arrive on that date .
neutral	best price , fast delivery .... but i still don_'_t know if i '_ve got what i paid for .
neutral	i bought golf_clubs which suppose to have irons with graphite shafts , but they looks_like steel ... no respond from customer service at all .
neutral	i '_m not going to send them back as it '_s not worth to do so ... however i will never buy form them anything again .
neutral	if possible to rate 0 0 / 0_star .
neutral	auto_europe took_care of reserving the vehicle , and it was ready for us as expected , however we paid for a full size sports car , with the picture of a well_equipped high - end audi , and ended_up with some cheesy skoda vw model .
neutral	feels_like we got the absolute least decent vehicle they could fit into the category we paid for .
neutral	oh well , live and learn .
neutral	next time i '_ll just book direct with a rental company .
neutral	find it difficult to understand_why i '_m being asked to review this service when i haven_'_t received the item yet !
neutral	even_though next_day delivery was advertised ...
neutral	ordered the bike on a sunday but it took over 0_weeks to deliver it , which in this day and age is unacceptable .
neutral	for the most part the service has_been pretty good one problem i ran_into is in the return dept .
neutral	. i ordered a fan_shroud for a 0000_chev .
neutral	pickup they sent me one for a 0000_chev pickup .
neutral	.
neutral	i looked at pictures on parts_geek web_site found that a 0000 shroud pictured is actually the one for the 0000 . so i ordered it and it came and fit . so i wanted to return the first wrong shroud , it was shipped from az .
neutral	for 0 dollars . i was told to return the shroud to some place back east .
neutral	the cost for shipping was over 00 dollars from oregon .
neutral	the shroud only cost 00 dollars so needless to say i didn_'_t send it back and i now have an extra fan_shroud that fits a 0000_chev not my 0000_chev .
neutral	i ordered this 0 days ago .
neutral	it still has not shipped .
neutral	two of the three tins of tennis_balls were badly_damaged .
neutral	i had already signed and the courier had dashed off before i opened the package .
neutral	as i was using the balls in the next two_days it didn_'_t matter that the tins were not sealed however much more care needs taking with future deliveries .
neutral	collection took a little while , delivery back took over 00_mins .. not sure if it was down to traffic or just slow service .
neutral	overall ok .
neutral	i ordered a rear_window wiper_arm for a ' 00 toyota 0 runner .
neutral	it was the correct one , but did not come with the very special screws needed to install it .
neutral	i ultimately located the wiper_arm assembly ( different brand , but same spec ) at two different auto_parts stores in other towns when i was traveling on business - and in both of those cases , the custom screws and washers for mounting the arm were included .
neutral	i didn_'_t buy them , but located similar screws on the internet and ordered them separately .
neutral	the arm should have come with the screws to install it as it is easy to damage the original screws when removing them .
neutral	the booking confirmation i received , was an_email with a voucher that i have to present at the hotel .
neutral	one day before the trip i got a call from somebody from france trying to contact me in italien but finally we agreed to speak in english since any language was hard to understand ( even english ).
neutral	however , the strange part is that i got questions on details of my booking , including my credit_card which i never expect to hear over the phone .
neutral	i travel a lot , but this was the first time i was getting such strange questions .
neutral	so hope everything goes well tomorrow ...
neutral	addition 0000 - 00 - 00 :
neutral	thanks for the reply .
neutral	the voucher worked pretty well without problems at the hotel .
neutral	just waiting for the correct invoice now ....
neutral	they would have got five_stars but ...
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was ordering several items from the same range .
neutral	annoyingly , after adding an item into basket , i had to return back to main page of site then continually search for range then select next items .
neutral	very time_consuming .
neutral	better site layout would be that you can click on multiple items in range then add to basket collectively .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i cannot find any confirmation of selected delivery date in any email or when logging_into account .
neutral	i have ordered 0 drivers_side ( left ) door_handles and recieved
neutral	0 passenger handles .
neutral	don_'_t know what the problem is .
neutral	i cannot_fault the system that i purchased - it '_s both fast and stable and hasn_'_t crashed once since i took delivery of it .
neutral	my biggest gripe is with the communication received from dinopc .
neutral	i sent them a simple email_asking if my pc would arrive by the weekend and got a very generic response .
neutral	considering the amount of money that i paid them , i expected a more personal reply and not a standard piece of text that simply tells_me that the system will be with me within the allocated time frame stated on the website .
neutral	i then spoke to dinopc after it had reached the allocated turn_around time ( 00 working days ) and they informed me that my system was ready , but their packing machine ( air bag filling machine ) was faulty and was awaiting repair .
neutral	this was the final straw for me seeing as the pc had been ready for 0 days and no - one had been in touch with me to let_me know .
neutral	after a stroppy conversation ( me being the stroppy one ), it was agreed that i could have my pc the next_day ( saturday ), but i would have to pay £_00 extra for the privilege .
neutral	if i weren_'_t absolutely desperate for the machine i would have told them to stick it where the sun doesn_'_t shine , but alas i paid it and it turned_up when they said it would .
neutral	overall i would recommend them as a company , but be aware of the lack of communication that you will receive from them .... hopefully they will fix that soon though !
neutral	fast , clear and convenient
neutral	i called you recently to buy some gu00 bulbs , i wanted specifically the narrowest gauge of light projection you had to offer , the young_lady told me which ones i needed and i bought 0 to test the water .
neutral	they are fine as bulbs go but they are not what i was looking for .
neutral	i wanted a specific spot - style light for paintings in an art gallery that do not light up the whole painting a circle of projected light no bigger than 00 " in circumference and warm .
neutral	i got cold and a spread that would light up a 0 metre area .
neutral	i am not complaining i will keep the bulbs i can utilise them , but i did not get what i wanted .
neutral	upon_arrival for our flight , everything was excellent , from the hotel employee who checked us in to the attendant who loaded our_luggage and took us to the airport .
neutral	upon our return , we called and were told to flag the driver down when he approached .
neutral	three other couples flagged him down first , and there was no room for us .
neutral	the driver told us he would be right back , and told_him to pick us up first since we were left from the last pick - up .
neutral	he agreed , but when he returned , picked_up two other couples first , and we were squeezed in to the small space remaining .
neutral	we are a bit older , and this made the experience difficult , not equal to past excellent service
neutral	still_waiting on these items :
neutral	0000_chevrolet cobalt exhaust_gasket - 00000 walker - $ 0 . 00
neutral	0000_chevrolet cobalt heater_hose - 00000 dayco - $_00 . 00
neutral	latest update on 0 / 00 showed the following :
neutral	tracking_number : fedex :_0000000000000000000000
neutral	note_: the 00 ... number is not a fedex tracking_number but a usps number .
neutral	tracking that number via_usps shows no updates since the 00th !!
neutral	estimated delivery on the 00th ... did not arrive .
neutral	the usps should not be involved in shipping your goods .. they stink !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a lot of stuff but its weeks and still not all in stock .
neutral	as regards a previous delivery i would have liked to have been given the option to collect at the delivery depot instead of getting it delivered when im not home
neutral	i haven_'_t travelled yet .
neutral	i booked twice with bookit . com and both time i have to call to book the package because somehow the website crash or it just give me a message to call .
neutral	i appreciate the customer service but being a foreigner with long last name create a lot of misspelled .
neutral	the two times booking with bookit , my girlfriend last name was spelled incorrectly twice .
neutral	first time bookit couldn_'_t fixed it and airlines couldn_'_t fixed it , so tsa was questioning and have to call their supervisor to approve my girlfriend is who she really was .
neutral	the 0nd time your rep fix the misspelled with no problem .
neutral	but all can be fix if i can make reservation online , therefore i can make_sure all the entries are correct .
neutral	glasses ordered were " cat eye " and i expected smaller glasses than what received and now cannot use them
neutral	its a booking website ??
neutral	?
neutral	product was dispatched_promptly and eventually received and was as_advertised .
neutral	unfortunately the company uses a courier that only delivers during the working week and the nearest depot where parcels can be collected on saturday_morning is 00 miles_away .
neutral	not great for the majority of us who work !
neutral	i have made this reservation many_times over the last 0 0 / 0 years using the marriott member number and the direct hotel number .
neutral	during all of these experiences i felt_comfortable and well taken_care of .
neutral	this time the entire experience was different .
neutral	the agent never made it clear what organization i was talking to .
neutral	" is this marriott ?
neutral	no , ...."
neutral	the stay went wonderfully but that was because of the hotel staff .
neutral	they recognized us and confirmed room with roll - in shower .
neutral	the agent said we had one , but , the e_-_mail did not say that .
neutral	price is good delivery sucks
neutral	finally , the web catalog showed one door_handle , inside , for the mighty metro .
neutral	" it " was the very inexpensive one .
neutral	after ordering , a day or so later , i got a notice of a refund , as if i had cancelled , or retuned the handle , that i has ordered : huh_?
neutral	i thought i had ordered a left outside rear door_handle for a 0000_geo prism .
neutral	however , what i got was a right side door_handle .
neutral	i am still working with geekparts to determine if they are going to send me the part i need and if they are going to take_care of all the associated shipping cost .
neutral	if they do my opinion will be good .
neutral	if not my opinion will not be good .
neutral	the product we purchased was delivered ontime and was of good quality .
neutral	the biggest problem we had was trying to get aftersales service to answer the simple question we raised .
neutral	it got to a stage that we doubted that they even had a technical_department .
neutral	for a company like this to take over two_days to answer a simple question totally offsets any high opinions we had of the company and their customer_satisfaction expectations .
neutral	i am very happy with the pricing and quality of the parts they have available .
neutral	i just wish their shipping department would do a better job of packing the merchandise .
neutral	just throwing the part in an oversized_box with a little bubble_wrap laying in the bottom didn_'_t cut it ......... the part flopped around in the box and a piece was broken off of the back of it .
neutral	luckily the back piece is not visible when installed in the car .
neutral	perhaps it would be better if their shippers would actually put some bubble_wrap around the part to protect it !
neutral	item came quickly , packed in bubble envelope .
neutral	but for £ 0 . 00 this charge for light package of two knobs is really too much .
neutral	i should call in and find out what the problem is , but half the time i try to make a call i am met with a recording - this number is not recognized .
neutral	i '_m just using my cell_phone and hardly ever even try to use phone_power .
neutral	out hotel was everything we had hoped it would be .
neutral	in a great location , at a great price !
neutral	what i did not like was thinking i was on the hotel '_s site and finding out later i had pre_- booked & prepaid for the room through your sight !
neutral	i thought it was deceptive , and underhanded !
neutral	trust me , i won_'_t be using your sight again if i am at all aware of it !
neutral	i had just bought a set of glasses at the local eye boutique , takumi frames with magnetic sunshades .
neutral	i wanted to have a few extra pair of the sunshades and the local store was going to charge me $_000 / set .
neutral	i was able to get them online for only $_00 / set , a 00_% savings .
neutral	my only disappointment was that the sunshades did not come in the nicely shaped cases like the original set .
neutral	parts_geek has a poor customer service model .
neutral	they only reply via_email and the replies are ineffective as i was asked to supply info via_email twice that i had already supplied .
neutral	their website said the part would fit my car and when the right side and left_side parts i ordered were not mate , parts_geek charged me a restocking_fee even_though i still purchased the correct mate to the part .
neutral	there is absolutely no way to get a human .
neutral	disappointed to find packaging all smashed one headlight had scratches but not enough to go through headache of returning
neutral	comfortable , spacious , handling reasonably well .
neutral	only one major fault .
neutral	the electronic windows seized up .
neutral	have used airpark for many many_years .
neutral	i really_liked everyone at the mcclellan location .
neutral	this is the 0st time at this location and i '_m not thrilled .
neutral	the entrance is very tough to navigate to .
neutral	lots of trucks and not well identified .
neutral	i came in after midnight and had to wait much longer_than anyone_else for the tram to be picked_up .
neutral	much longer then was told to me on the phone .
neutral	i would love to give you a review but my order placed june_00th hasn_'_t arrived yet !
neutral	june_00th !
neutral	!
neutral	the overall glasses are good and work well .
neutral	the marketing does give you the impression that you save more money re - glazing your old specs but it is marginal .
neutral	there was a delay in delivery but this could have been a communications mix_up
neutral	i recommend pc_game_supply and have done so with no regret .
neutral	easy to use no problem
neutral	so have sent email_asking for help .
neutral	great quality and great stuff but the button on the jeans fell_off , this was an obvious manufacturing_defect as the back pin of the button had not gone_through the fabric into the front part of the button , overall great but mildly disappointed .
neutral	my first time at town_fair .
neutral	i needed two tires replaced .
neutral	got there early at 0 am on a weekday morning and it '_s been over two hours wait so_far , and my vehicle has_been sitting there with the tires off and no one tending to it for the past half_hour i have been checking .
neutral	so , the good price does come at a cost , as it seems they are understaffed .
neutral	after_placing an order for a collection and next_day delivery , it then took a week and lots of phone_calls to eventually get my parcels picked_up and delivered .
neutral	... still_waiting for a call for a replacement .
neutral	one of the items purchased , an automobiledoor handle , was the incorrect item .
neutral	it was for the wrong door .
neutral	i shall need to return it .
neutral	friendly service but rather a long wait at birmingham_airport on return which defeats the object of the service for the money paid .
neutral	this was explained as being due to shortage of staff and having to park the cars offsite which wasn_'_t explained on booking .
neutral	apart_from that the staff were friendly and clearly trying to do their best
neutral	saw the advert for a sale offering a white item of clothing , i already owned the black so though the white would be great , i had ordered and paid , only to receive a call a bit later saying white is out i stock and only black available , i was offered black and a " shaker " as why i think was a slight apology .
neutral	i get lured in to ordering the white then jut getting palmed off with black , then on receipt of delivery there was no shaker .
neutral	i can safely say i won_'_t be usin this company again .
neutral	or even referring them to a friend
neutral	the " lead - in " price was very attractive , but the final price was considerably more .
neutral	alternative date , baggage , transfers etc seemed to add a lot to the cost and the costs kept rising as the conversation went along e . g .
neutral	baggage cost added then increased when 00 kilo '_s requested .
neutral	there were no_faults with the representative '_s friendliness , helpfulness or efficiency in ringing back to confirm the booking , however , there were errors in the booking confirmation that were quickly corrected when pointed_out .
neutral	if i have choice for faster delivery i will give you 00 / 0 .
neutral	i signed_up a while back , and occasionally check it out , but if you don_'_t spend all day on twitter , you can do everything on it on facebook .
neutral	only a certain kind of person really needs twitter .
neutral	paypal does not inform you of the commission they take on certain transactions .
neutral	they took 0 % of a purchase i made without detailing it before .
neutral	i don_'_t mind_paying commission but this needs to be clearer .
neutral	i like the website and the fact they give out credits to large order so often .
neutral	the only_complaint i have is that i '_ve experienced some lagging with the site .
neutral	in prior orders , i had ordered with no_problems .
neutral	on my last order , i ordered an incorrect part .
neutral	most companies allow you to return the part with no restocking_fee .
neutral	i had planned on ordering the correct part from them once the incorrect part had been returned .
neutral	now i am told if i am to return this part , american_rv wants to charge me a 00_% restocking_fee .
neutral	i will think_twice the next time i need to order from them .
neutral	on 0 occasions , i placed orders with eeuroparts . com and their prices were great .
neutral	only problem was that when i asked for a better price to match another online_retailer , response was , " no ."
neutral	on the other occasion when i asked if brake grease comes with pads , response was , " i haven_'_t seen them come without ."
neutral	in other_words , responses are somewhat stiff and could be interpreted as abrupt .
neutral	he could have said , " yes they do come with ........." i think good customer service could get some polishing .
neutral	on other hand , they are knowledgeable and intuitive with their craft .
neutral	the part i ordered arrived in good condition and in a timely_manner .
neutral	unfortunately , though it was listed on your web_site as the correct part for my car , it was not .
neutral	i am awaiting resolution .
neutral	ordered 0 car parts .
neutral	one showed_up broken .
neutral	filled_out their online service ticket like they wanted because they will not answer their phone .
neutral	why have a number if you do not intend to answer it ?
neutral	got a full_refund for the broken part though .
neutral	i have many superdry t shirts all large ... but the fit in different_sizes .
neutral	some tees are smaller than others , while some are bigger .
neutral	this is very strange as they all say large on the label .
neutral	this is a big problem .. please sort it out .
neutral	print it out before you go to the airport they won_'_t let you on the plane if you try showing it on your phone funny bc you can print a screen_shot .
neutral	and you will be o . k .
neutral	some of the unbranded materials seem a bit " iffy "
neutral	prices very competitive - shame about all the forests they destroy for their far too big catalogue though
neutral	was excited when i found this website , because the part were very reasonably_priced .
neutral	however when i received my part it was broken , i assume from the shipping .
neutral	it was a little irritating but they got back to me and said they would just ship me another part .
neutral	so even_tho it took a little_longer then expected , i got my mirror and i am satisfied .
neutral	i purchased mma shorts and tshirts , excellent quality and price . but i was charged for delivery for my order over £_00 , when i contacted deepblue i was told that my items where on offer and i didn_'_t qualify for free delivery .
neutral	but there is nowhere that i could see where it states this .
neutral	also the checkout deals would not show up on my order and when i tried to buy the same products from the web_site there where dearer .
neutral	but i will_definitely be buying from deepblue again :-)
neutral	i returned a jacket to yourselves as the zip was faulty .
neutral	i was then informed via_email that the jacket had been delivered to me however .
neutral	i wasn_'_t informed as to whether it had been repaired or replaced and i wasn_'_t informed that it was being delivered back to the store where i originally picked it up from , until i emailed your customer care team .
neutral	i just feel communication could have been alot better .
neutral	service and delivery were excellent .
neutral	i had damaged my previous frame and was delighted to find a sale on the website .
neutral	unfortunately , i found it was impossible to remove lens securing screws on the frame .
neutral	they were unbelievably tight .
neutral	i had no option but to fall on the mercy of my optician for assistance .
neutral	firstly we are delighted with the furniture .
neutral	when we arrived at the cambridge store we were met .
neutral	by the manager who offered us a a cup of coffee , a nice gesture of which we enjoyed ..
neutral	this was our first visit to an oak_furniture and we enjoyed the look round .
neutral	after we had made our choice of tables we approached a sales_representative who made out the order for us .
neutral	however , we felt we were strongly encouraged to purchase the warranty and polish offered , when we changed our mind we felt we had disappointed the salesman as the atmosphere seemed to changed towards us .
neutral	this was a let_down as up , to that point it had been a pleasant_experience .
neutral	the delivery was spot on ,
neutral	everything has_been fine except that i returned the glasses since they were not what i wanted and the rma was processed quickly by fd on 00 / 00 .
neutral	i have still not received the reimbursement on 00 / 00 .
neutral	i just reached out to their operations_manager and i expect this will be closed shortly .
neutral	conversatie werd - toen de betreffende medewerker er geen zin meer in had - gewoon gestopt ( per mail ).
neutral	gelukkig pakte een andere collega het uiteindelijk wel goed over .
neutral	kwaliteit drukwerk is prima .
neutral	within about a half_hour of ordering the part , my customer changed his mind and did not want it anymore .
neutral	when i emailed to try to cancel the order , i was informed that they do not cancel orders , and that i would likely have to pay a 00_% restocking_fee to return .
neutral	this is kind of annoying , since on amazon you can cancel , change the shipping location , or change the payment_method as long as the item has not been shipped , just by clicking a few buttons .
neutral	the quick delivery mentioned in some reviews is a myth , mine arrived 00 days_later .
neutral	also , the price of the contact_lenses i use 00 years_now was exactly the same with my high_street optician .
neutral	other than that , the lenses are fine and the packing is decent , so i guess i '_ll might use them again in the future .
neutral	while you have the best price and speedy shipping , one of the parts i ordered was not right .
neutral	this did not bothered me so much , as we all make mistakes .
neutral	the turnaround on my trouble ticket has_been slow .
neutral	i put it in on friday , it is now tuesday and i have not heard_anything back
neutral	0_weeks to get a part ??
neutral	i get items shipped from china in 0 days .
neutral	eventually the reservation was completed , however
neutral	it was difficult for me to understand her .
neutral	however i do have a hearing defect and can only
neutral	decipher clear - language
neutral	i received my items no problem , but for them arriving inside a package which was for someone_else and i had to mail on to them , otherwise they wouldn_'_t have received them .
neutral	bit lax and need to be more careful .
neutral	that apart , happy with my items and price was good .
neutral	when you place your order there is no confirmation that the order went through .
neutral	i thought there was a glitch and went back to the order page to submit the order - same situation .
neutral	tried to call and was placed on hold for ever .
neutral	i couldn_'_t submit a customer service request as that part of their service was down .
neutral	i was concerned that they would send a double order .
neutral	was able to send a service request the next_day but they never responded .
neutral	i got my order within a few_days so all was ok . would have felt more comfortable if i had received a conformation and an order number when the submit_button was clicked .
neutral	a statement indicating the order was submitted and an invoice would be sent via_e_-_mail would have worked as well .
neutral	well friend , why is information so ridiculously outdated , usually incorrect , but has current bearing on virtually everything attempted to survive in this miscalculated society ?????
neutral	?
neutral	certainly quick to get underway but the form_filling when arriving at the medical section was mind numbing .
neutral	who can remember start and stop days of illness years after ?
neutral	not me i '_m afraid , and when i attempted to speak to someone and settle my doubts the phone lines were not manned .
neutral	consequently felt a little in limbo .
neutral	sorry folks , but that '_s the truth .
neutral	not informed that drop_off and meet and greet no_longer available , even_though that is what we paid for .
neutral	had to drive into the short_term car_park , which is not a meet and greet facility .
neutral	given incorrect information by driver , who said that anyone dropping_off at_gatwick , had to pay £_00
neutral	pay for return shipping ....
neutral	i haven_'_t ever had to do that in my life
neutral	generally have been very pleased with autoeurope ; have rented many_times ..
neutral	good car : not cleaned properly .
neutral	from europecar .
neutral	last time i spoped around for exchange_rate ( pound to aed ) and found them better .
neutral	but this time they have me £_00 . 00 more than the market .
neutral	they are trustworthy .
neutral	abdul
neutral	clubs got to destination fine .
neutral	four days late getting home missed a tournament .
neutral	club glove bag was stained badly and looked like it was drug behind the plane on the runway .
neutral	ship stix removed the charges on the return trip no questions ask .
neutral	i ordered a samsung 0000 screen and received a 0000 screen , no correspondence whether they are compatible or not .
neutral	other than that very fast service .
neutral	i was impressed by the prices however when i bought two small items and my shipping came to $_00 that was a bit irritating .
neutral	so it shipped from two different_warehouses however one of the boxes was 00_percent air bags and 00_percent product for an air_filter ( not exactly a heavy item ).
neutral	the items were showing in stock on the web_page , and i waited one week for response , i phoned and was told that the items were not in stock so i waited about 00 days as the lady on the phone said it will take that long . i received the items last_week .
neutral	company should make shore that the stock they show online are in store .
neutral	travelocity was one of the best , with the lowest service fees of any .
neutral	not any more .
neutral	their site looks just like expedia , who i presume bought them out .
neutral	priceline is now the best .
neutral	too bad , i used travelocity all the time , until now .
neutral	got the part relatively quickly , but return for the core process is too slow .
neutral	get emails acknowledging return and then saying directions to return are coming and that was five days ago ... why not just send directions first time after registering the return !
neutral	prompt delivery just wrong part !!?
neutral	?
neutral	we paid the extra £_00 for express delivery in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	we saw nothing in the small_print about world locations and exclusions .
neutral	the product was not received until the end of the ninth day .
neutral	initially the vehicle was booked for 0 days however , to allow further travel time this was extended to 0 .
neutral	the charge for the extra day plus insurance ( including the cdw zero option ) with taxes , i thought was quite expensive .
neutral	in addition , because the vehicle was dropped_off at a different location to the pickup , a relocation fee was incurred .
neutral	in relation to this i noted that whilst the vehicle was picked_up in calgary ( in the province of alberta canada ), it was registered in british columbia and as it was returned to vancouver ( in british columbia ), i question wether it was actually being relocated .
neutral	i would like to point out to other_travellers that insurance costs on top of the rental charges can be quite prohibitive & to be mindful of the pickup and drop - off locations .
neutral	in the future , to keep cots down i would not drop the car off at a different location .
neutral	item was just purchased on web .
neutral	searching and check out was easy .
neutral	will update once product arrives .
neutral	i got my package really quick and a great price , but was discouraged to see that when i opened the box a piece was broken on my product .
neutral	the package looked like it was just thrown in the box with some bubble_wrap .
neutral	not enough to keep it from sliding around and breaking though .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother contacting the company because i really needed it so i just glued it back in place .
neutral	this site has great prices on lp '_s ( vinyl ) in particular and a decent price on shipping .
neutral	the only problem is the site isn_'_t updated enough and when you order stuff that they say they have in stock it '_s a 00_percent chance you will actually receive it .
neutral	also another problem is they won_'_t inform you if what you ordered is out of stock or not so it is kind of a suprise when you open your package as to what you get .
neutral	and e_-_mail notification would be really helpful in warning customers that certain items within their order is out of stock and the site wasn_'_t updated correctly , but they fail to do this .
neutral	after being a customer here for years that it the main thing that frustrates me , if you are buying something as a birthday or christmas_gift for a loved one stay_away and order elsewhere just because you never know if they actually have it .
neutral	hope this helps
neutral	i just spend more than 0 / 0 hr trying to return product to no_avail , because there is no return address in the box they send to me go figure !
neutral	also the picture they put online for the product i needed wasn_'_t the same , all i know is i '_m $_00 .
neutral	short !
neutral	!
neutral	it works for me .
neutral	good price .
neutral	close to airport .
neutral	smooth_transaction although i '_m dissatisfied with your company policy .
neutral	i checked for the part i needed but couldn_'_t place my order until the next_morning .
neutral	when i placed my order , i found the price increased almost ten_percent .
neutral	( overnight increase of ten_percent !)
neutral	i contacted your customer service and was told you reserve the right to change prices .
neutral	should have honored your original price in this case .
neutral	i will now check rock_auto before you !
neutral	i received the wrong part for the wrong year truck .
neutral	i '_m waiting for the mixup to be fixed .
neutral	stop the ads i will not renew if you continue .
neutral	also , the other people have what you want us to buy as free .
neutral	quick turn_around is great .
neutral	this was the 0rd time using them that i found a mistake with the translation .
neutral	all mistakes were dates .
neutral	make_sure you proof read the returned product .
neutral	i booked a budget car , handled by avis .
neutral	booking_procedure was all right .
neutral	when i arrived at the airport there were no cars available in the booked category h . anyway i got something similar , probably even better so i can '_t complain - if .... avis charged me a few euro more dispite the printed reservation copy that showed the exact price .
neutral	i said ok , it is more a principal question than about money , the difference was really small .
neutral	but when bringing back the car they charged me some 0 - 0 euro for winter_tires telling_me that they are more_expensive .
neutral	i think this is absolutely not fair , you should know the exact price payable in advance and not be tricked afterwards .
neutral	for at starte med_det gode .
neutral	maden var virkelig god , om end stegt flæsk med persillesovs ikke_kan kaldes gourmetmad , men_det_var vi heller_ikke blevet lovet !!
neutral	betjeningen var_meget ung , men god , dog ventede vi næsten 0 kvarter på forretten den første aften - i en " set menu " både vin og vand var absolut i den dyre ende .
neutral	værelserne var pæne - ikke for rene , vi fandt vores del af spindelvæv , men_der_er_meget trafikstøj , jeg forstår ikke , at man_ikke investerer i støjdæmpende glas , larmen begyndte allerede ved 0 - tiden om morgenen !
neutral	!
neutral	ikke det billigste selskab , men_jeg_har kun fået god service .
neutral	so i order all the stuff i need and even talk to a really nice sales guy , then i get some automated message_telling_me that my stuff is backordered a month .
neutral	there is no reason a plain green lanyard should take a month of backorder .
neutral	it was too easy to double book my vacation
neutral	used food warmer ... could have been cleaned better .
neutral	still had lime deposits inside .
neutral	i have ordered from parts_geek for a while now .
neutral	parts are always priced well and shipped the same day i order them .
neutral	only recently have a contacted customer_support .
neutral	some parts were listed for my vehicle which i was not sure would fit .
neutral	i emailed customer_support and did not receive a reply for a couple of days .
neutral	when i did receive a reply it did not answer my questions .
neutral	i eventually figured it out own my and placed my order .
neutral	i just hope i never have to return anything .
neutral	this site is pretty good , i stumbled_across it , had google play card with a digital code .
neutral	the only problem with this site is the phone_verification .
neutral	the most stupid thing in the world .
neutral	i do not have a cellphone , i have a land_line .
neutral	i entered that number and said it was an invalid number .
neutral	so i had to call one of my friends and ask if i could put there number for the activation .
neutral	there has to be a better way than that stupid designed system .
neutral	otherwise , great site .
neutral	didn_'_t receive my shipment for three_weeks as apparently it was delayed in customs .
neutral	hadn_'_t read far enough in the faq to see this was a possibility , but it made the purchase as expensive as local , with a wait to boot :-(
neutral	online order didn_'_t give notice when order didn_'_t go through then when i called need to be able to sleek to a person left message never was called back i wasn_'_t going to order but had to have parts at that price
neutral	every time i order the cards they are backordered .
neutral	makes me think i should just go to the company you are ordering from
neutral	alanhensononline00 posts .
neutral	joined 0 / 0000thumbs up : 00i ordered 00 seats from them a few_months back which cost a pretty penny .
neutral	they said due to the amount i was spending i was a preferred customer .
neutral	which came to mean they preferred more money than less .
neutral	i get a modified receipt about 0 months later that was for $ 0000 less_than i paid them and my chairs show up 0 days_later which did not have all my options on them .
neutral	so after 0 emails and 00 ± unreturned phone_calls it is apparent they are gong to do nothing to fix the chairs or refund the difference .
neutral	my only recourse is to reverse the chargers .
neutral	follow_up 00 / 00 :
neutral	i did receive my parts for my seats finally .
neutral	they did and up making everything right for me .
neutral	a very nice young_lady name tiffany went out of her way to make things right .
neutral	they are lucky to have her .
neutral	the main problem was just lack of communication i '_m the beginning but they did end up making everything right in the end .
neutral	i would recommend buying from them now .
neutral	good quality but too expensive
neutral	parts that i ordered were on back order .
neutral	i was requested to call them after a week to ten days to see if parts had been restocked .
neutral	i called for four days in a row , at different times of the day , and i was put on hold every time .
neutral	my calls were never answered even after waiting as long as fifteen_minutes .
neutral	i have yet talked to a human_being .
neutral	i am beginning to wonder_if this business even exists .
neutral	hi . nice compact glasses but fragile . also the case is huge for small glasses . i won_'_t be using the case .
neutral	service and delivery was grate .
neutral	i did not have to spend a week before i had the ink , but one of the black cartridges was leaking ink in it '_s bag .
neutral	and it seems to be a little runny , and the black prints a bolder line than i was expecting , but it '_s still acceptable and i will be sending my used cartridges back for recycling .
neutral	i also will be ordering again form you in the future .
neutral	you have a good thing going , and keep_up the good work .
neutral	all in all , the growing pains are starting to show and slow things down so it '_s more like all the other airports - but not in a good way
neutral	longer wait for a bus to get you off the plane
neutral	longer wait at passport control
neutral	longer wait for luggage
neutral	less cover in the walk back to the car_parks in the rain
neutral	convenient but not as convenient as it used to be
neutral	one cd in my order came blank .
neutral	i e_mailed them 0 days ago but as of now no answer .
neutral	not a bad grille but not as structurally sound as a oem .
neutral	looks good but very plyable .
neutral	the cooker was cheap to buy but the price for spares is hard to belive
neutral	looked like a delivery from amazon .... not anything like interflora .
neutral	would rather pay more and not look a tightwad
neutral	nice products , easy to order .
neutral	i have bought from other web sights and they explained what you were buying and how many items per order .
neutral	i bought rotors for a car and nowhere did it say the order came with one in a package .
neutral	other web sights you ordered front or rear_rotors and it would have two front or two rear_rotors per box and it stated if it was one item per box .
neutral	i went back to your web_sight and nowhere did it say how many in the box .
neutral	makes me think i could do better somewhere_else .
neutral	after_placing numerous orders before at over $_000 per order and being a customer for quite some time , i was unable to speak to a manager and no accommodations were made when their staff made an error .
neutral	no measly $ 0 . 00 credit no expedited_shipping no extra samples no nothing .
neutral	after_contacting lisa via_email and asking to speak with a manager because i was dissatisfied , i was refused and no attempt was made to go above and beyond for me due to their mistake .
neutral	disappointed and you can even get a manager to speak to you .
neutral	amazed .
neutral	we found the signage difficult to find on our first time at this lot .
neutral	i think a sign with all of the offerings for the road would be more helpful than the random bunch , catch as catch can jumble .
neutral	pick_up and delivery went without a hitch .
neutral	jalbum was one of those rare sites and products that made you feel_like not everybody was out just to get a buck .
neutral	they had a great product , let people use if for free , kept striving to improve it , updated it frequently , and fostered a friendly , participatory environment .
neutral	it was perfect for me because , first of all , i '_m poor .
neutral	when you ' re on disability there '_s not much you can do sometimes except keep your mind busy on your computer .
neutral	i do 0d computer art and jalbum was the perfect way for me to construct two small galleries .. one had 00 images and one had about 00 .
neutral	i had more than enough free space , and then they gave everyone even more space !
neutral	so i had room to grow and create .
neutral	then recently they announced that they were no_longer giving any free space , even for a tiny gallery .
neutral	not only that but they were taking back all the free space they had already given out unless you bought a certain membership .
neutral	what they should have done is told people that from now on they would only give out a small_amount of space for free so you could maintain some kind of gallery and share it with friends and family .
neutral	or that they were no_longer providing any space from now on to new customers but that current customers could keep the space they were already using or had already been given .
neutral	i felt betrayed .
neutral	it was depressing .
neutral	i know they have a bottom_line but they don_'_t feel_like the friendly company they once were .
neutral	i bought the membership even_though i couldn_'_t really afford it because i felt forced to and i didn_'_t want my albums to disappear , but i '_m going to start looking for some other kind of online album .
neutral	it probably_won_'_t be as slick and fun and creative as jalbum , but oh well .
neutral	i have a bottom_line too .
neutral	my sister in law '_s uncle is a photographer .
neutral	he recently started working on a big project and said he wanted to post all of it online but he didn_'_t know how to do html or make a web_page .
neutral	i told_him he didn_'_t have to , and that when he was ready i could show him this free site where you could make and upload beautiful , professional looking albums .
neutral	well , i guess he '_s one of those people who takes_forever to do something or one of those people who is always starting something big but never finishes it because it '_s been a couple of years and i haven_'_t heard from him .
neutral	it '_s just as well though .
neutral	i know he '_s still working on it , but if he asks me maybe i '_ll have to decide if jalbum is even worth_mentioning .
neutral	maybe i '_ll find something better by then .
neutral	i emailed to say that the product wasn_'_t the best and i did get a response .
neutral	i suppose the product may not be to my liking .
neutral	i bought a heater_core for my 0000_volvo 000 wagon .
neutral	the core arrived in a flimsy box with no packing_material and zero instructions .
neutral	it came with two different size gaskets while the original had only one gasket .
neutral	i made it work , but it would have been nice to have some instructions .
neutral	try to stay compertive
neutral	fair pricings , though too ages to deliver , i didn_'_t even receive a confirmation_email for my second purchase and it still_hasn_'_t arrived
neutral	opinion survey right in the middle of the checkout .
neutral	no chance to review my order for any_problems .
neutral	wham !!!
neutral	god d ^&%$ $%#@# survey .
neutral	sights great !!
neutral	but i won_'_t use it again because of the %^%^$## survey poping up every 00 seconds oh $%#@ i just got a survey request in my my e_-_mail !!!!!
neutral	i understand you want to make the site better , but why don_'_t you use it and fix what doen '_t work .
neutral	i bet your smart .
neutral	i ordered a toyota in - cabin_filter ( smaller than an avg air_filter ).
neutral	it was shipped in a box that could have fit 00 ( not exagerating ) of these things .
neutral	your shipping rates could be far less if your shipping department had a clue .
neutral	when i had a customer service question it had a reply instantly .
neutral	other than that i am still_waiting for my order to arrive .
neutral	i bought an evo aso speed lacer and it came with directions for the standard tie aso evo .
neutral	ok , may be i am not the sharpest tool in the shed , but it took me more time than i would have liked to figure_out how to use it .
neutral	the delivery was quick , the order communications were good .
neutral	i am really surprised that there weren_'_t instructions specifically for the speed lacer .
neutral	the right directions would have made this a perfect purchase .
neutral	i had to remove a $_00 part of he order because they we going to charge over $_00 to ship seperately .
neutral	some handsome items although a bit_pricey
neutral	you generally find what you need but after you go through the whole_procedure of entering details etc , you get the statement that item cannot be shipped to your country .
neutral	this should be in the item description so as to avoid waste of time and disappointment .
neutral	i '_ve gone to this hotel several_times .
neutral	one of the times i went there , the tv wasn_'_t working .
neutral	i didn_'_t use it but for those_who are hiding in the hotel , check your tv .
neutral	check your a /_c immediately .
neutral	if you see it is not cooling , ask for another room .
neutral	they '_ll try to simply send maintenance to check it , but i already saw how maintenance rolls .
neutral	they '_ll just fiddle with the buttons , shrug , and leave .
neutral	it happened to me .
neutral	i went to front_desk a third time and firmly requested another room .
neutral	no_problems from then on .
neutral	haven_'_t really tried the pool .
neutral	like i said , i just use the hotel to sleep , not to stay in .
neutral	now , the beds , pillows , etc , very comfy .
neutral	there '_s hot_water , the rooms sometimes include an iron and ironing board , which is good .
neutral	hair dryer too .
neutral	after refining the search several_times by starting over , i found something [ not quite what i set out for ].
neutral	it is convenient and seems to be comprehensive , but i tend not to rely_on just one provider .
neutral	company sent me a cd_key that was bound to be banned , i contacted them and they gave_me a new cd_key which is working for now , i hope it will stay that way , next time i just start a dispute with paypal for not offering the item description which was 000_% valid and legal cd_key .
neutral	one thing i should add is that their customer_support is very good if you catch them online that is , all i asked the customer_support representative was why was my cd_key banned and he immediately gave_me a new one , sure it made me wonder_whether they were expected this to happen , but still they were very prompt .
neutral	i went to purchase items that was on sale ... but was told after going to checkout i needed to purchase another $_00 . 00 worth of merchandise to complete ' my order ' .
neutral	needless to say i cancelled my order and may never go back to that site again
neutral	ordered parts at 0pm on a thursday ; paid the extra for overnight delivery .
neutral	didn_'_t show until tuesday and incomplete .
neutral	still have not received one part ; been a week .
neutral	products were fine , just when you are waiting on parts and have questions , waiting 00 - 00_hrs .
neutral	for a response doesn_'_t really work for me .
neutral	tickets where bought for my in - laws as a gift and unfortunately my mother - in - law had a nasty fall down the stairs when they where wet , had her ankle checked out and luckily she hadn_'_t broken anything other than that everything was fine , she is back on tuesday with her sister but i don , t think she will be taking her limp up any stairs .
neutral	g . culley
neutral	some difficulty searching , but able to find stuff .
neutral	then a confusing order status that seems to be at_least a day behind as well as inaccurate .
neutral	i ordered 0 items , found 0 was backordered , other 0 go to " ordered " when other_vendors might just ship partial ( the ordered and backordered both met the $_00 .
neutral	but good , one of the products was available through my new nursing agency after all , so i cancelled it by phone , and was told the other " ordred " product ( gloves ) could ship the next_day if the backordered product didn_'_t show up .
neutral	which is what happened , but when i checked the status on - line again , first is showed the cancelled , then went back to 0 ordered , then showed all 0 as shipped !.
neutral	only the gloves were shipped .
neutral	the total changed to reflect the cancel , but i was charged for the backorder before it was shipped ( illegal ?).
neutral	now the backorder has shipped , but when i call up the order from the order history it still shows the cancelled item as shipped .
neutral	i really loved the ease of ordering and the money i saved by shopping at parts_geek .
neutral	everything i ordered was what i got except for the ball_joints , and they were switched with cheaper ones .
neutral	which really pissed me off because they didn_'_t give me back the difference in price .
neutral	overall , i ' d still shop at parts_geek again and would recommend them to all my friends .
neutral	hostelworld has generally been a very good place to search for accommodation .
neutral	they have by_far the best range and selection of accommodation of any site i '_ve used .
neutral	their prices are very reasonable ( apart_from the service charges that a lot of other_sites do not charge ) and the site is very well set out and easy to use .
neutral	however saying all of this , with one very bad_experience now i prefer to use hostelbookers . com .
neutral	i had booked a hostel in san sebastian , spain at_least one month before i was set arrive .
neutral	the booking was 00 euros per person per_night .
neutral	0 days before we arrived in san sebastian the accommodation contacted me saying ' the price has now risen to 00 euros per person per_night .
neutral	if you can not pay the extra we will have to cancel your booking .'
neutral	this made it very difficult on us as now we had to find reasonably_priced accommodation in the middle of peak season in spain less_than a week before arrival and we could not afford to pay the extra .
neutral	the property should not have been allowed to do this as we had already paid our deposit and received confirmation paperwork .
neutral	i contacted hostelworld with the problem and the were very unsympathetic to our problem and more or less said ' we will credit back the deposit but you need to book somewhere_else .'
neutral	i feel that more could have been done on hostelworld '_s behalf to make_sure our booking and confirmation was honoured .
neutral	an overall disappointing experience .
neutral	i made a reservation at sleep inn and when i got confirmed it came back confusing showing a two person when it should of been one person .
neutral	called and was told it '_s a standard reservation setting .
neutral	( still confusing )
neutral	i asked for a king_bed / down stair room , when i arrived i was told that the only king beds were up on the second floor .
neutral	i didn_'_t want a second floor , i wanted a ground_floor i don_'_t understand_why the person didn_'_t say something ?
neutral	i know why they got my money and with a decline reservation day of arriving i ' d still loose one day cost .
neutral	i really don_'_t think i '_ll be staying at this inn again .
neutral	jack_sparrow pirate sword very nice good quality .
neutral	adult deluxe pirate boot tops good but the elastic string broke when trying to fit on my shoes .
neutral	this was expected one size fits all .
neutral	some little alteration will fix it .
neutral	deluxe jack_sparrow accessory kit for some strange reason i got the kids size .
neutral	bad !!
neutral	!
neutral	adult caribbean pirate hat the hat is very nice well_done with details fits good but is kind too big .
neutral	realistic caribbean pirate costume very nice , very good details , good quality .
neutral	jack_sparrow headscarf very nice
neutral	authentic pirate wig to my surprise it was the real thing and brought all the beads and extra stuff !
neutral	company service was good and fast on the packing and shipping but they really mess up by confusing the accessory kit from adult to kids size .
neutral	negative_feedback :
neutral	initially very helpful but as the purchasing procedure progressed various computer errors became_apparent .
neutral	the website has a considerable_amount of bugs which became very frustrating to circumvent .
neutral	the accounts department although helpful appeared to completely lose the plot and i received various differing costs for my orders .
neutral	i am still confused as to the correct total price ?
neutral	the dispatch department appeared to be overworked and held ransom to highly unstable company software .
neutral	positive_feedback :
neutral	everyone i spoke to was helpful and tried to give good customer service .
neutral	however , i still have not received my ordered goods yet !!!
neutral	been waiting five days now .
neutral	offers little in the way of reports .
neutral	they call them updates , but they are only numbers with the amount of changes , you have to do the research yourself .
neutral	one time my credit_score number was off by 00 points on one bureau .
neutral	thought of canceling more than once .
neutral	i have ordered from partsgeek only a couple of times .
neutral	their prices and selection are great but shipping efficiency leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	both my orders took well over a week .
neutral	you can choose expedited_shipping options but that defeats the point of buying here ... it would be cheaper and quicker to buy local .
neutral	for the price i paid in shipping , they could have shipped priority_mail and i ' d have my parts in 0 days .
neutral	instead , they shipped fedex part way then transferred to usps .
neutral	if you can wait a week or two for your parts then partsgeek will surely save you some money but for most circumstances , saving a buck or two to fix a broken vehicle isn_'_t worth it .
neutral	i did enjoy your coffee , it '_s good and can compare to nespresso coffee ; but the capsules are very tight in the machine ( may be longer_than the original nespresso_capsules ); whenever loaded in the machine , i have to push hard and am afraid to break my machine .
neutral	i hope you '_ll make the new capsules the same shape of nespresso ones .
neutral	that '_s why i have to rate 0_stars
neutral	ordering my tyres was very easy using black_circles .
neutral	i chose a premium garage near me expecting the fitters to be professional however he fitter revved my car and wheel span it out of the garage .
neutral	he then pulled the handbrake really hard and now it feels_like the cable is stretched .
neutral	i ' d use black_circles again , just not brunel tyres in bristol .
neutral	i ordered 0 dunlop aerogel 0d 000 rackets .
neutral	the rackets arrived with a factory string in place .
neutral	both rackets were strung incorrectly .
neutral	a 0 piece string technique was used and the crosses have been weaved from the throat to the top of the racket .
neutral	this places unnecessary tension on the racket frame and in some_cases can cause the frame to break .
neutral	in order to avoid customer returns caused_by broken frames from poor string jobs then tennisnuts should string their rackets correctly .
neutral	the price was good , communication not so good .
neutral	i recieved the unit with damage to the heat strip from shipping .
neutral	i sent email and pictures of damage with no response .
neutral	but my ac guy had the part so no big_deal .
neutral	litt kronglete
neutral	my part arrived in a very large box in the part could '_ve been moving around and broken when shipped now i have to pay shipping to send it back so i '_m losing money
neutral	hello
neutral	well i have gotten 0 emails , one with a ra # but still no clear_instructions how to send back my part ?
neutral	please_let_me know soon before my 00 days are up .
neutral	take_care
neutral	i really_enjoyed using central_contracts when arranging the vehicle .
neutral	they were knowledgeable and really helpful .
neutral	communication was perfect and they were not push sales people .
neutral	i could not fault .
neutral	the issue came when the vehicle was delivered .
neutral	it was filthy dirty on the outside ( having been driven over 000_miles in the rain ) and messy on the inside on the drivers_side ( where he had clearly got in and out of the vehicle a couple of times during said journey ).
neutral	i '_ve never taken delivery of a new vehicle like that before .
neutral	when you have a new car you look_forward to it , but when it arrives like this , then it is an anti_- climax and real disappointment .
neutral	the car mats i had arranged were not delivered and then the wrong ones were sent .
neutral	so a week with no car mats and children , just really not ideal .
neutral	when i called , although the car mat issue was dealt_with , the company forwent the opportunity to really make a huge customer service point .
neutral	if it had been me i would have offered a free clean at next service or something along those lines .
neutral	i would really have gone out my way to apologise .
neutral	instead they hid behind the " we have no influence , it '_s an outside contractor not us " mantra .
neutral	maybe true , but that is just lazy , unintelligent customer service .
neutral	i want to see ownership of the issue and some action .
neutral	my wife now needs a new car - up to the vehicle arriving i would have used central_contracts ( even recommending to a friend ) but now not so certain .
neutral	probl was the flowers were left on doorstep - not good !!!
neutral	!
neutral	didn_'_t get a receipt emailed to me .
neutral	called bookit after spending several days online to determine our vacation plan .
neutral	figured it all out online ourselves then called to confirm .
neutral	took nearly one hour to get our plane and hotel reservation and then after repeating my email address 0 times to send us our confirmation i never rec ' d it .
neutral	had to call next_day to correct the email address error the bookit rep . made .
neutral	also wanted to rent a car on my american_express which supposedly the rep did apparently never happened .
neutral	just as well as i rented a car myself for a better rate and upgraded car at another agency .
neutral	bottom_line i am not happy with bookit reservations .
neutral	chemist_direct all over the box
neutral	my gallery has roughly 00 , 000 images in it .
neutral	when i want to add images , i choose to do a " smart upload ", but it always makes for a huge upload .
neutral	even if i add only one image , my uploads are at_least a gigabyte .
neutral	add that to the fact that the ftp times out or crashes enough that it gets very frustrating .
neutral	i love the premise of the product , love the galleries , etc .
neutral	but i am experiencing a tough time managing everything .
neutral	additionally , i have tried using a separate ftp program , but each time i do , links are broken , and it is a mess .
neutral	i wish it worked in one of two ways :
neutral	0 ) give me the option to upload from an external ftp program , and when i make_changes to an album , allow me these options :
neutral	0 ) make only relevant pages ( no images )
neutral	0 ) make and upload thumbnails for new images
neutral	0 ) make and upload thumbnails / previews
neutral	or
neutral	0 ) a php client that does everything server side .
neutral	in other_words , i love this gallery for the look and feel ... much more than other galleries i have seen .
neutral	but i would really like to have everything done server side .
neutral	that is , if i add one image , it would be very nice not to have to rebuild the whole gallery .
neutral	i recieved my order that was supposed to come with a full hardware kit but it was missing some studs that i needed to replace as well .
neutral	i sent a support_ticket to figure_out if there was a problem and 0 days_later i am yet to hear a response .
neutral	if they would get back to me and finish sending me all of my parts i would rate them a 0_star easily .
neutral	everything was looking promising , friendly chap on the phone confirmed they had my product in stock and it would arrive next_day .
neutral	unfortunately the courier never showed_up and when i chased they claimed it was because they didn_'_t have the necessary contact details .
neutral	i followed_up with normans customer service and they tried to help , but didn_'_t really communicate properly .
neutral	they were friendly and courteous , but never really followed_up .
neutral	i made requests of the customer service team to fix the problem with the courier , but i just ended_up getting an_automated email to tell me that it would be delivered the next_day .
neutral	it wasn_'_t .
neutral	the product finally arrived 0 business days after it should have done ( which was a day too_late for me ).
neutral	do it once will not do it again
neutral	pretty_much just that , good envelopes , good prices , but the charge goes right up once you add the postage .
neutral	i use jessops frequently - and my last order
neutral	000000 - 000000
neutral	which had a value of over £_000 - was received in timely_fashion - but the quality was extremely variable - most items were of satisfactory quality - but one was very disappointing ( and not a cause of my image file ).
neutral	i would be happy to pay a bit more - in exchange for certainty of receiving consistent levels of print product quality .
neutral	after i saw my items taken off the moving van , i wanted to change my size from a 00x00 to 00x00 .
neutral	i was not allowed to change my storage room without paying an extra full month for the 00x00 .
neutral	i think this was unfair .
neutral	the room was clean .
neutral	from the msg i received i thought i was asked to review my last purchase from travelocity , not travelocity itself , and in that light , the review i wrote was hardly germane .
neutral	the radiator fit perfect in my truck , but the radiator cap size was different and i had a difficult time getting the correct cap size at my local parts store .
neutral	suggest they sell cap to fit radiator with the radiator .
neutral	good quality cards , easy service to use .
neutral	however , ordered on a sunday , latest delivery was supposed to be thursday , actual delivery was saturday .
neutral	the polos were rather expensive and not happy with them at all .
neutral	they are like a tee_shirt with a collar sewn on .
neutral	the embroidering has a huge patch underneath shirt as well that is annoying , made very cheaply .
neutral	would get more tees done from here , but definitely not polos .
neutral	very unhappy after how much they cost .
neutral	it '_s cheap but the picture fucked me over .
neutral	there was no description of what i was getting .
neutral	the picture had rubber gaskets in it but they did not come with the fuel_tank .
neutral	set me back a week .
neutral	more than pleased with shutters , which look even better_than_expected .
neutral	excellent service from sales_rep and from the installer .
neutral	let_down by late placing of order following payment of deposit and unacceptably long delay in delivery .
neutral	i ordered an oil pump for a 0000_toyota_camry .
neutral	0 . 0 liter engine .
neutral	the oil pump was not cheap and it did not come with a gasket for the oil pump .
neutral	i cannot find one locally so i am having to to use the old one and hope that it works .
neutral	i ordered contacts over 0 days ago .
neutral	just now received a phone_call stating my prescription was not able to be located .
neutral	( i have a copy in my brief case which can be easily faxed ) they also charged my card 0 days ago !!!
neutral	the excuse for not getting a phone_call sooner was they tried to contact me via_email .
neutral	really !!!!
neutral	upon talking to customer service i stated they could satisfy me by overnight or 0 day mail my order , apparently this was unexceptable to their company .
neutral	management was not able to speak to me .
neutral	i was offered a refund however this dose not satisfy me after keeping my money for 0 days with no phone_call .
neutral	there are better companies out there to do_business with .
neutral	this customer service royally sucks !!!
neutral	after a second phone_call they agreed to overnight , my order .
neutral	i received next_day , thanks .
neutral	wish they inspected the material before they sent it .
neutral	the outer_box was not bent .
neutral	the tailgate protector was bent from dee zee
neutral	had a fantastic day out in london .
neutral	staff very friendly .
neutral	spent most of the time stuck in traffic on the bus although the river_cruise was superb !
neutral	the item was an electric passenger - side_mirror for a 00 year_old truck .
neutral	the replacement part looked exactly right .
neutral	but it was soon apparent that the electrical wiring was a little over an inch too short ( 0 cm ).
neutral	did not want to splice , so rearranged truck '_s door harness to reach .
neutral	next , three threaded sockets for mounting_screws were plastic - original is steel .
neutral	can '_t tighten w_/ o damage .
neutral	third , once mounted , only the left - right adjustment works .
neutral	up - down inoperative .
neutral	if this was for a client i ' d have to do a total replacement at my cost .
neutral	it '_s my truck so i guess i '_ll live with it .
neutral	it looks right , it functions .
neutral	if someone_else drives requiring adjustment , that '_ll suck .
neutral	because my order was large , around $ 0 , 000 , the confirmation process was cumbersome .
neutral	i purchased filters from this company in 0000 and again this year 0000 ( 00 months apart ) and the price increased 00 . 0 % .
neutral	not sure if i '_ll be able to afford them in another 00 months .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	still_waiting on the $ 0 they said they would " extend my way " .
neutral	not too pleased .
neutral	your customer_support is low and you need to contact specific email to have a support .
neutral	instead why don_'_t you hire 0rd_party or outsource cs
neutral	product was great but the delivery was horrible .
neutral	my part got delivered to someone across the city that was nice enough to bring to the correct address .
neutral	would normally expect to have received the goods before being asked to reveiw the service .
neutral	perhaps somebody could expedit delivery ?
neutral	?
neutral	the pens are not the best quality .
neutral	hostelworld is a good way to make travel_plans in a area you don_'_t know very well .
neutral	all hostels were clean , well managed and a good value .
neutral	the only_complaint is that if need to change your plans at the last_minute you are out your deposit .
neutral	even making a change from 0 nights to one nights i ended_up being stiffed for the deposit paid to hostelworld which was not credited .... so be_careful !
neutral	i placed an order for 0 x 000cl bottles of a product but was sent 0 x 00cl bottles .
neutral	the 000cl bottles work out much_cheaper so i did not wish to keep them and asked for a return .
neutral	i was sent an_email the next_day stating they would be collected anytime after 00_minutes later !
neutral	unfortunately i was at work not an unusual situation and the collection had to be rearanged .
neutral	great service and communication_throughout the ordering_process , right up to delivery .
neutral	the lights came exactly as ordered and well_packaged .
neutral	its just a shame that the hanging icicle_lights i bought did not arrive with the 00 free gutter hooks , per set , that they said i would get .
neutral	ordered four dog bones but only three came .
neutral	emailed that same day ( a saturday ) and recieved an_email that night saying they were sorry and they would send out another bone , with free shipping of course ( should hope so , they were the ones that messed_up the order ).
neutral	all in all it was acceptable .
neutral	very happy with the quality of jumper i brought on line but the sewing is quite poor on mine and my girlfriends coats we brought .
neutral	they are both the same ladies and gents wind breaker coats the stitching is def not satisfactory .
neutral	also i ordered cloths on line as a surprise for my girlfriend but it turned_up in a branded bag so surprise was kinda spoilt .
neutral	petflow '_s prices are average ( but with free shipping if you spend enough ) and the autoship_program is convenient and allows for a lot of flexibility .
neutral	the only issue i have is that they sent an autoship package when i was on vacation and no one was home to receive it , so i lost a $_00 bag of dog_food and will have to cancel the autoship_program .
neutral	i contacted their customer_support system , which was not very effective .
neutral	through emails i had a hard time getting the situation to be understood , and finally had to call .
neutral	one of the two people responding to my emails insisted that an_email had been sent to me prior to shipping ( which i never got , and yes , i checked my spam_folder ), and the the other one told me that there had been a problem with their email server so that not all emails were sent .
neutral	in the meantime , i '_m out $_00 .
neutral	a handling_charge is another name for shipping charge .
neutral	be honest .
neutral	i just tried installing my tail_light_lens for my 0000_dodge caravan .
neutral	i cannot get the electrical socket to connect .
neutral	it looks_like the pins are not aligning properly .
neutral	it '_s a deep socket , and i cannot see where the pins connect .
neutral	it inserts , and then stops approximately where the pins would meet the insert .
neutral	the light_bulb sockets went in without_any problem , but the electrical socket wont connect .
neutral	i did the name your own price thing and got a great deal on the minivan i was going to be using for a couple weeks .
neutral	after i had that van for a couple of week i realized i needed an_additional car for awhile for a daily driver ( i am military and my car had not caught up with me after moving ) so i again went to priceline and got an ok deal on a car .
neutral	the problem came when i went to the airport to pick_up the second car .
neutral	after having already paid though priceline for the second car the car company ( alamo ) told me they couldn_'_t rent me a second car while i still had the van .
neutral	after talking with priceline and alamo neither one would refund the difference in the cost or offer an acceptable option that would work with my situation .
neutral	it ended_up costing me about $_00 in all which is why they get three stars .
neutral	parts_geek would probably be a good place to buy my accessories if they would
neutral	ship with a reliable company instead of fed . ex ...
neutral	in my opinion , fed_ex is a fair weather shipper ... they won_'_t go off the main road
neutral	if it snows ....
neutral	around here , the only way to ship is usps or ups ....
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received my order ......
neutral	like the leagues and everything my main cplaint was during the draft and also picking_up free agents had no stats or anything next to it
neutral	i ordered both parts together and the tracking link showed them to both show up this past saturday .
neutral	for some reason only one of the upper_control_arms showed_up and then the link showed the other coming on wednesday .
neutral	that really made me mad when i could only do half the job now i have to wait_until next weekend to replace the other one .
neutral	i placed what i consider to have been a fair sized order .
neutral	upon check out it said it would ship in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i checked on my order 0 calendar days_later and it had not been shipped yet .
neutral	i was told by laura that she would check with shipping and " call me " back i called back on wednesday and spoke with someone_else , who gave_me a similar story .
neutral	i ended_up getting my supplies on saturday .
neutral	had i not been able to change my nuc delivery date with my bee supplier , i would have been in trouble .
neutral	last two orders have been delayed in shipping .
neutral	first off , the customer service was brilliant .
neutral	the sheath itself hold the nice very well ( very noisy ) but does it '_s job and for a carry '' all '' knife sheath it '_s impressive .
neutral	it fits my mod knife in very well .
neutral	it is however massive , but i guess it must have to be , the velcro straps on the back are not that great but for >£ 0 i can '_t complain .
neutral	it '_s also ugly but that does not matter so much .
neutral	it does the job , and will be perfect while i work on a good quality leather knife sheath .
neutral	would love both straps to have the little turn catch rather_than the loud velcro and straps on the front of the sheath too for carrying extra .
neutral	it was easy fast and simple but if i would of just paid at the hotel instead of here i would of saved over 00 $
neutral	i need door_handles and i couldn_'_t really afford the genuine replacement parts .
neutral	and i thought that , what ever the name of this company is , had good prices and made it easy to find what i was looking for on their site .
neutral	when i checked out and was charged two shipping_charges i under stood that to mean that the items were shipping in different packaging .
neutral	when i saw that both items shipped in the same box , i really wondered_why i was charged two shipping fees .
neutral	but i am not mad i just don_'_t plan to use them again .
neutral	left out slash symbol on " 0 / 0 " in address causing a delay in delivery .
neutral	shipping a little_slow to begin with .
neutral	would not purchase from them if i needed part in a hurry .
neutral	your service was very prompt , but your shipping cost are outrageous .
neutral	i recieved the parts i ordered .
neutral	i was a bit upset with the shipping though .
neutral	i recieved one product within two_days of ordering .
neutral	the other product did not come until over a week_later even_though both were shipped within a day of each other .
neutral	other than that the products work fine .
neutral	good quality product overall but disappointed at the push flash button , it stacks occasionally and costumer had to call me to rectify it . not a very good design .
neutral	went there while dave glover was there to get the front and back of my daughters iphone replaced ( and color changed , because she was tired of the white ).
neutral	i had this quoted a couple of months_ago and i was told front and back would be about $_00 . 00 .
neutral	i guess they had a massive price increase , because with the " discount_code " the price was $_00 . 00 .
neutral	( yes that is not a type - o .)
neutral	but , as was already here , i was ok with it .
neutral	i was told 0 hours , ( dg was actually saying less - with no guarantees ) when i didn_'_t receive a call or text at the 0 hour point , i returned to store and they had trouble_finding my phone .
neutral	then when they did , they said it would be 00 more minutes .
neutral	they found the phone would not play sound out of videos through the speaker but fine through the headphone jack .
neutral	a problem i was not aware of .
neutral	they fixed that .
neutral	so cool .
neutral	when the phone came out it had not changed color as i made sure to tell them in the beginning .
neutral	so they said it would be another 00_minutes or so .
neutral	it was done in about 00_minutes .
neutral	works like a charm .
neutral	so , like i said , once they get the kinks worked out , it will be great .
neutral	i would still recommend it .
neutral	there are so very many websites that are trying to make one believe that they can get better prices than their competition .
neutral	we need fewer , not more .
neutral	it is too time_consuming to check them all out , and there can be as much as $_000 a night difference_between all the " best price " offers you see .
neutral	i recently went onto weekend . com and they had their prices against all their booking . com , the hotel . info etc , and the range of prices for the same room was very wide .
neutral	i use only two sites and stick with them .
neutral	i will only change if i am truly ripped_off .
neutral	i know this is not what " they " wanted me to say , but this is how i feel .
neutral	the hockey_stick had minor_damage to the face .
neutral	too little to justify sending item back but never - the - less an annoyance .
neutral	dispatch was reasonable but the service provided by the courier was very poor . i was emailed with delivery date given as friday but it did not arrive and when i contacted the couriers they were rude and unhelpful which_resulted_in my contacting millet sport to complain but they were totally unhelpful when i did eventually make contact .
neutral	i tried 0 different numbers all of which were unobtainable and eventually i made contact by email and was given the informatio already available on the couriers website telling_me my stick was in birmingham .
neutral	they also told me that all of their phones had crashed !
neutral	the stick eventually arrived on the monday
neutral	so_far it '_s been good .
neutral	i '_m waiting for processing on a visa to china .
neutral	i wish the company would hurry though and send me emails regarding the status of my via rather_than questions of my satisfaction .
neutral	i really need this visa and maybe i '_m just stressed out , but satisfaction surveys seem unnecessary .
neutral	our auto shipment was trying to be sent before we received the first order .
neutral	other than that we are very pleased with petflow
neutral	i recently ordered a key for the collectors_edition of spore .
neutral	i received my order after about 00min and was extremely disappointed 0 of the keys didn_'_t work and the key that did work was for the creepy and cute expansion pack .
neutral	also i cannot contact them via their website due to the " send " button not being linked anywhere .
neutral	until this issue is rectified my rating stands .
neutral	edit_: found their email and have managed to get into contact with them
neutral	parts came seperately days apart so job took_longer_than the customer was willing to accept .
neutral	ironically the one package that we paid shipping cost on was the problem , it was scheduled for delivery early like the other parts were but was mis sorted at ups and delayed .
neutral	ups was more than willing to reimburse shipping but request had to be initiated by partsgeek and partsgeek refused exclaiming that they paid for three_times the shipping cost than us and it would be shipped within the alloted time ???.
neutral	so we waited , and on the last day of the estimated shipping period the parts arrived and we buttoned the car up belated .
neutral	we took_care of the customer and hopefully they will give us another opportunity to order locally next time and not fool with a discount internet site with no customer service phone_number .
neutral	lesson_learned
neutral	i am happy with the ordering_process but i can '_t comment further because i am still_waiting for my order to arrive .
neutral	they sure promote free shipping but never mention the handling_fee of $ 0 . 00 until one is all signed_up and ready to order ....
neutral	does not make repeat_customers .
neutral	very disappointing to find your prices have risen over 00_% since my last purchase several months_ago .
neutral	very pleasant rep at pick - up .
neutral	easy drop_off .
neutral	a little_pricey for waht you get .
neutral	bought my wife two tickets for the rod stewart concert at men manchester on sunday 0th_june_0000 .
neutral	promised top quality seats within the first 0 rows that were normally reserved for " vip and record co guests gr 0 seats gr 0 value " we received block 000 row e seats 00 / 00 .
neutral	when we got there our view of the stage was blocked by three ( 0 ) sound recording dishes as we were behind the mixing desks .
neutral	i have pictures of our restricted view but can '_t attach them to this review .
neutral	the restricted view put the brakes on what would have been an excellent evening and concert .
neutral	i ordered a galaxy_s0 tardis skin from diabloskinz .
neutral	diabloskinz communication is good , and they deliver very quickly .
neutral	for just a skin ( a design sticker you can put on your phone ), i think they are quite expensive , though .
neutral	furthermore , the skin is not very well_designed .
neutral	the alignment with buttons , sensors , speakers and cameras on my phone was not 000_% accurate , and i had to take the skin of and put it back on a couple of times before it actually fitted on my phone without obscuring important parts .
neutral	thankfully , the material is quite good , so you can easily take it of and put it back on without too much risk of ripping it or reducing the ' stickiness '.
neutral	the same image is used for each phone .
neutral	the quality of the design could have been improved by slightly altering the image in order to maximise the quality of the design in relation to the holes for cameras and buttons , but this wasn_'_t done .
neutral	scores from 0 to 00 :
neutral	communication : 0
neutral	delivery : 0 . 0
neutral	costs : 0
neutral	product quality : 0
neutral	design quality : 0
neutral	gostei do resultado , mas nao é definitivo , qnd parei de usar o_produto tudo voltou ao normal !
neutral	i know .
neutral	it '_s a huge company .
neutral	service is okay considering .
neutral	but i am still getting too many dead air spots when i am driving .
neutral	t mobile !
neutral	put some more antennas up already !
neutral	!
neutral	good service when ordering but it a nightmare trying to return a part ..
neutral	the service itself was fine overall , however it seemed to take ages .
neutral	in fact from pickup to clearance of paid funds it took nearly a month !
neutral	from what i '_ve read online , there are better paying and faster companies around .
neutral	so do your_homework first , especially if getting the money soon is important to you !
neutral	i bought an itunes_card and the activation_fee was high .. why even there is a fee on it when its a digital delivery !
neutral	i '_ll definitely rate more if the activation_fee was gone and no more or may be less_than this .
neutral	everytime i buy for example 00us card of nexon_game cash y get charged 000us and only get 00us card .
neutral	those funds get blocked and i have to wait like a week to used them
neutral	i placed a complete orderof parts to have one shipping_charges -- you made three shipping arrangements at different dates with three tracking_numbers -- very complicating and comfusing for the buyer ??
neutral	also : making late deliveries because of your ware - housing !!
neutral	finally got the parts !
neutral	!
neutral	haven_'_t received part ordered waiting for rightone
neutral	i '_ve had voip service for several_years_now however i recently just switched to phone_power on the pretense that they offered great service at a low price .
neutral	the issues i '_m experiencing so_far as follows_:
neutral	0 .
neutral	poor fax connection at high speed so i had to slow down my fax transmission speed .
neutral	0 .
neutral	at times it does not allow you to call certain numbers with a message " we are sorry but the number cannot be connected as dialed "
neutral	0 .
neutral	lastly it will frequently drop calls .
neutral	unfortunately i paid for the full year so i will have to endure the next few_months unless they correct the issues .
neutral	i have hot_toner to be godd at delivery and on price .
neutral	however , i had an issue recently and put in a query on the website - there has_been no reply .
neutral	we signed_up for the ltp_club and used it recently and our card didn_'_t work getting into the parking area and didn_'_t work leaving the lot .
neutral	hope this works better the next time !
neutral	found the parts i needed at a very reasonable price but 0 days_later i am still_waiting for my parts while my vehicle sits idle !!!
neutral	parts_geek may want to revise their shipping policy from 0 - 0 business days to may receive in the distant future !
neutral	the trophies i ordered were ok , but the engraving wasn_'_t so good .
neutral	one of the engraving plates is stuck on slightly wonky and the engraving on both isn_'_t very bold and not straight either .
neutral	not really a great problem for my golf society as we don_'_t take it as a serious competition , but if i were buying awards or trophies for my company i might be more disappointed to the point of trying elsewhere .
neutral	i had purchased products from ex med befroe and was very pleased with its reponsiveness and it srange of poducts .
neutral	thie time around , i was disappinted to learn that the poduct i needed has_been delayed agtleast a week .
neutral	soo have had to use analternate method .
neutral	order process is nice and simple .
neutral	will create better review after receipt of order and expect rating to improve
neutral	still_waiting for my order . i '_m sure i will be happy with it .
neutral	why say 0 day delivery when you actually mean 0 , and then leave it next door when you say you wont do that as it has to be signed for
neutral	all in one is excellent as is zma and omega caps .
neutral	good value too .
neutral	casein is awful , mixes far too thick and lumpy , impossible to have a 0 scoop shake .
neutral	also , free_shaker advertised not provided and twitter account for company was to look in to but hasn_'_t come_back to me since .
neutral	two of the six items i ordered didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	no_explanation .
neutral	going to mera peak in october and the 00 + lip block and non phosphate synthetic clothes wash didn_'_t come through with my order even_though it had been accepted !
neutral	was rather disappointed as i ordered two items for my son for christmas on 0rd december and one arrived mid december .
neutral	the other item was not with it so i waited for a while and then when it had not arrived contacted tennisnuts by email .
neutral	i received a strange email back asking for a photo of the box the item came in and a copy of the invoice .
neutral	i replied that there was no invoice / delivery note .
neutral	i wrote a couple more emails as nothing was happening and i had no reply .
neutral	eventually after christmas i received an_automated email_saying my other item had just been dispatched and it arrived a couple of days_later .
neutral	no apology and no invoice / delivery note .
neutral	products have been ok , but communication with the company not so good .
neutral	i have used your company previously and was impressed with the speed of delivery and the product .
neutral	with this in mind i chose the same product as before for my current project , but although the magnets stick to the metal frame as expected , unfortunately the ' glue ' to stick the magnets in place is not strong_enough , thus meaning i have to keep repositioning them when they come away , very frustrating .
neutral	i did a ph strip test on my culligan water after putting 00 drops in a liter of water .
neutral	the result was less_than reassuring .
neutral	it showed the water treated with alkavision drops to still be acidic ( around 0 . 0 to 0 . 0 )
neutral	great selection fast shipping but one of the pieces of a $_000 + dollar order was damaged upon_arrival .
neutral	although their site says they will file a claim with the parcel shipper they told me i had to .
neutral	i ordered the currency on friday_morning at 00 . 00 am .
neutral	all very good and easy
neutral	delivery says if ordered before 00 . 00 will be delivered next working day .
neutral	good as i was going to be in on monday all day .
neutral	unfortunately the currency arrived and i was not in and ended_up having to go to the local sorting_office which is 0 miles_away .
neutral	if i had known i was goingto do this i would not have ordered on line and expected a delivery .
neutral	they should ensure if it says next working day they mean next working day or are saturdays a working day now ?
neutral	shame really as everyhting else was good .
neutral	i love this this site cuz of the prices and parts selection but their tracking is horrible .
neutral	i ordered a bunch of parts for many different vehicles and the tracking_number says it '_s in one part of the country but is actually on my door_step but only part of the order .
neutral	i will still use this site but don_'_t expect all your parts to arrive at the sametime
neutral	not recieved my policy
neutral	pricing was competitive and parts shipped very quickly .
neutral	unfortunately , they weren_'_t the right part .
neutral	small plastic pieces that should have fit for our make and model but didn_'_t .
neutral	ended_up buying from volvo directly so that we didn_'_t have issues with replacement .
neutral	volvo is slower and more_expensive .
neutral	it was a shame that the part wasn_'_t right .
neutral	need to sort the layout for iphone can use there full service
neutral	there was no place like in the past where one could use there rewards for a flight , forcing me to use my credit_card .
neutral	they made and sent the labels very fast but back of labels were blurry .
neutral	i have order many_times but have found lately that the descriptions of a part / set is not adequate and neither are the pictures .
neutral	i have a return in process for a set of injector seal kits for my 00 datsun 000z .
neutral	i explained in my initial email that the injectors i purchase had the seals included but the description did not say so nor did the picture show them .
neutral	so i ordered the seal kits but when i got everything i realized i did not need the separate seal kits .
neutral	the rma_# is 00000000 and if i am charged a restocking_charge i will never order from them again !
neutral	i ordered a fender_liner .
neutral	it was not the manufacturers part , but a replica .
neutral	i got it to work fine with a few adjustments but it doesn_'_t look as professional as the standard part would .
neutral	since the inner_fender isn_'_t really visible , it wasn_'_t a big_deal for me .
neutral	our experience was ok , just beware that they close at noon for lunch for two hours and no one will get your car between those hours .
neutral	returning the car after hours is a piece of cake though .
neutral	very polite staff .
neutral	the product was defective and had to return within two_weeks .
neutral	i am waiting to see how the company will resolve this problem .
neutral	my car was picked_up fine by a nice polite man who wished us a happy holiday and was very helpful .
neutral	on return i picked my car up from again a very nice gentleman but my car had bropken down within 0 mile of the airport .
neutral	this left me and my partenr stranded on the side of the m00 waiting over 0 hours for a recovery service to pick_up our car .
neutral	we called to ask about any_problems with the car the driver may have experienced but he seemed sure it was fine and worked on arrival which i don_'_t doubt .
neutral	we were told it was against policy for us to picked_up though which would have been nice as we did have to cross a very busy motorway to get the airport so we could keep out of the cold and away from dangerous traffic .
neutral	to be picked_up would have been a nice_touch considering the vehicle was so badly_damaged after pick_up i will now have to scrap the car but i don_'_t doubt the integrity of your driver who claims it was in good nick when he left .
neutral	overall the service was good but more could have been done in good faith i felt .
neutral	on my most_recent order i requested three cds .
neutral	when i received the order i only received two as one was out of stock .
neutral	i paid $ 0 . 00 for s &_h for the order .
neutral	i also received a credit on my account for $ 0 . 00 (( paid for on the original order ).
neutral	i found a sister cd by the same group for $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i called to request if stock was available and i placed an order for that cd .
neutral	now i am told i must pay an_additional $ 0 . 00 to ship the $ 0 . 00 cd .
neutral	since oldies had my email address why didn_'_t they ask me to replace the out of stock cd with another to ship with the original order - thereby saving me an_additional shipping charge ?
neutral	the monthly and daily_limit is not sufficient and the activation_fee is too high
neutral	probably_won_'_t order again based on the long time it took to receive my order .
neutral	it was delivered much later then promised .
neutral	i made a mistake when giving my delivery address , if a phone # were available at that moment , i would have been able to correct it before shipping , instead the package was delivered a block away , and i had to retreive it myself .
neutral	customer_support e_- mailed a phone_number 0 days_later .
neutral	just as others said when reviewing site , the company allegedly had the watch in stock , but gave no status_update , & shipped it a week after ordering . theres no excuse for this slow service & not keeping the customer informed .
neutral	thought i was buying a pair of items , as the description read as screws .
neutral	as a result i have had to make another order
neutral	you don_'_t know what you ' re going to get .
neutral	i arranged a rental in new_zealand recently through argus and when i arrived to pick_up the car it was a 00 year_old banger .
neutral	ruined my enjoyment of driving around .
neutral	even with the 00_% online discount , $_00 is very expensive for a 0 day open top sightseeing bus_tour .
neutral	traffic is terrible in dubai .
neutral	you ' d be better off trying to use the metro to get around .
neutral	didn_'_t get to do the boat_ride as the bus doesn_'_t arrive in time with the boat .
neutral	i can '_t wait around 0 . 0 hrs after getting off the bus in 00 + degrees .
neutral	the company needs to get some shaded bus shelters at the pick_up points .
neutral	nearly right
neutral	no issue with the product or speed of delivery , but ... look out for the duties , taxes , & customs !
neutral	the small_print says , " the price for the goods shall , unless otherwise agreed , be the price set out on the dispatch confirmation .
neutral	the price for the goods quoted on the website shall be exclusive of all costs of carriage and insurance and applicable import_tax / vat / gst and duty which the buyer shall pay in addition ."
neutral	a friend told me about partsgeek . com and that same nite i checked out the site .
neutral	within minutes , i had placed an order and was impressed with the availablilty of the many parts in stock and especially impressed with the prices for my 00 suburban .
neutral	wish i knew of this site years_ago .
neutral	my only_complaint is not being_able to get_ahold of anyone after my order was placed because i needed these parts asap and was willing to pay whatever $ to make it within a few_days .
neutral	the next_day i started calling from 0am up until 0 :_00pm and consistantly was getting hung_up on after waiting 00 + minutes on hold .
neutral	i did this for 0 days and then found on the site a link to open a customer service ticket on which i got a email response back .
neutral	i found out the parts came from california and there was no additional shipping options for the parts i ordered .
neutral	guys and gals .... all im saying is to improve on customers being_able to speak to a live_person regardless the question or situation at hand .
neutral	i will_def order from partsgeek again but have to plan around it .
neutral	i just ordered my first 00 pound_bag of serious_mass from them , i was recommended by a friend .
neutral	if all goes well , i will_definately_use sw , and serious_mass again .
neutral	i looked on your site for replacement wheels for my old travelpro 00 your website stated the new skate wheels size 00mm would replace the 0 0 / 0 in originals there was not enough clearance i have to send them back and get the original wheels i was looking for something better
neutral	thanks , john
neutral	good selection of parts - good prices - order way ahead of time and wait .
neutral	good service however shoes ordered where to narrow so returned same and paid £_00 . 00 00 ( plus postage for return ) for a wide fitting but when they arrived they are no wider in my opinion
neutral	ordered wrong_size heating mat , rang customer_services , extremely_helpful and all sorted_out with one phone_call , correct size mat arrived as_promised .
neutral	no refund for two_weeks , called customer_services , refund will be sorted that day .
neutral	seven_days_later no refund .
neutral	next call resulted_in " accounts will call you back " same day .
neutral	no call but on checking bank_account next_day money refunded .
neutral	poor communication , no_explanation as to why refund took over three_weeks .
neutral	so i wanted to make a reservation with embassy_suites .
neutral	googled the name and proceed to make reservation .
neutral	all good until i got a notice from my cc company saying my card had been charged for the room reservation which was a month away .
neutral	went in to see what happened and realized i had been duped into thinking i was dealing_with embassy_suites when in fact i was going through a third_party .
neutral	the transaction went_smoothly and it appears i can get a refund if i cancel with 00_hours notice but i am not happy with being fooled - no one is !
neutral	!
neutral	parts_geek is a good company .
neutral	but if you have to send anything back its a night mare .
neutral	they can learn from amazon .
neutral	parts_geek charges you to ship back the part even if it does not work .
neutral	and there web_site clearly says that it does .
neutral	that dont make me happy .
neutral	but if you get lucky and its the right part then there good and good priced .. parts_geek .
neutral	follow amazons lead .
neutral	i think you will do much_better .
neutral	i ' d attach a picture to show it but the shipping box was undamaged but inside the box for the product and gasket were damaged so it seems like the damage existed before shipping , not real happy about that .
neutral	as for the other " friction " item , i acknowledge partsgeek is not responsible for the slow shipping , but i would encourage them to either use usps or fedex , not the hybrid shipping option of fedex putting a stamp on it and sending via us_postal service , it just added 0 days to the shipping time ( part was in town 0 days ago , fedex put it in the mail " for delivery "
neutral	a lot of traders promise a substantial " cashback " but the automatic system frequently does not give you the cashback on offer .
neutral	you have to raise the issue and keep monitoring the situation and after months of waiting and prodding , the money does ultimately arrive .
neutral	i guess topcashback and these traders expect that the customer doesn_'_t notice or can '_t be bothered to invest the time and effort to get what is legally due .
neutral	examples : the various car parking agents at_gatwick airport , such as airparks and holiday extras .
neutral	ordered a 0tb hard_drive via flubit .
neutral	hard_drive was delivered promptly but only wrapped in a thin layer of bubble_wrap and placed in a plastic_bag .
neutral	i was very surprised when it still worked after traveling half way down the country in the back of a van .
neutral	it would make me wary about buying hard_drives from this company again .
neutral	i cannot_believe_how fast my order came to me .
neutral	thanks so much .
neutral	i ordered ink_cartridge on 00 - 0 - 0000 .
neutral	they sent it on 00 - 0 - 00 but put my address wrong .
neutral	the courier sent to the wrong_address and left a note there .
neutral	when i rang them 0 days after they said no one was home and courier had left a note .
neutral	i told them that there are people at home always and we have not received any note .
neutral	they then rang courtier and found that the address that they had provided was wrong .
neutral	the next_day courier delivered the cartridge .
neutral	they have not yet admitted the error of their dispatch clerk and not apologised yet for inconvenience that this stupid error has caused to me .
neutral	i absolutely love every product i have ordered from this site ( mostly fitness_equipment and food ).
neutral	it is of the highest_quality .
neutral	i will_continue to place an order monthly .
neutral	however , the packing and shipping quality is sometimes poor .
neutral	i purchased an ekobrew , and the packing was destroyed ( luckily the actual ekobrew unit was intact ).
neutral	i also have a friend that purchased the individual himalayan_salt packs , and they had all burst .
neutral	it '_s a great company with great products , so please only read the above criticism as a process improvement opportunity !
neutral	first order is great and prices amazing .
neutral	after that , no need to continue orders .
neutral	prices are better elsewhere
neutral	see_above and despite my email report on my return to uk i have had no reply from you as to the unexplained charge
neutral	the delivery was perfect , well_packed delivered through a good courier service and the sending costs as expected for the service provided .
neutral	the payment made me almost walk_away , if i could have found the product else where i would have walked !
neutral	my credit_card was accpeted through my usual system , and then i had to contact you and told it was my bank , which was the problem , amazing before and after never had a problem , blocked by my bank ?
neutral	no !
neutral	so i paid with paypal , if you wish to pay with paypal use them , if not , don_'_t
neutral	strange that amazon . co . uk had no problem , and other sellers through amazon , also hotels in the uk , no problem , using a personal card_reader , but you have an excuse so another time i know i have to use paypal or go elsewhere .
neutral	jeg_har handlet_hos elounge et_par gange efterhånden og_jeg_er ganske tilfreds_med deres priser , som ofte er_meget lave i forhold_til_andre sider .
neutral	de_har dog en tendens til ikke at levere til_den tid de_lover .
neutral	jeg_bestilte to varer ( en hardback tegneserie og en box med fire paperbacks ) som havde_en forventet levering på hh . v .
neutral	d . 0 / 0 og d . 00 / 0 ( jeg_bestilte bøgerne d . 0 / 0 ).
neutral	dagen_efter modtager jeg en email med beskeden om at hardbbacken først kan leveres d . 00 / 0 , hvilket var fint at_vide , men i praksis betød det_ikke_noget , da_jeg_ikke_havde bedt om , at få dem tilsendt hver for sig .
neutral	det_var altså stadig d . 00 / 0 , der stod som seneste leveringsdato .
neutral	d . 00 / 0 modtager jeg_så en besked_om , at varerne er sendt af sted og_jeg modtager et track ' n ' trace - nummer ( som_ikke virkede før tre dage_senere , men_det må vist være det kære postvæsen , der_står for dén detalje ).
neutral	jeg_modtog varerne d . 00 / 0 , tre dage_efter leveringsdagen og dette_var uden besked fra elounge .
neutral	jeg_vil fortsat handle_hos elounge , grundet det store udvalg og de billige priser , men er_det en hastesag , vil_jeg nok vælge at gå til_en_anden forhandler .
neutral	i dette tilfælde var_det ren hyggelæsning , så den sene levering gjorde ikke den store skade .
neutral	having spoken to the office at towequipe , we bought their 0 bike nimbus bike_rack which is a fantastic product and at the same time bought a tow_bar online .
neutral	the bike_rack arrived as a flat_pack with the tow_bar fitter and assembly is easy .
neutral	the guy came and fitted the tow_bar very efficiently and all was great until i tried to connect the electrical_connector of the bike_rack to the tow_bar whilst also using the bike_rack lock .
neutral	one got in the way of the other ... there were two options - to switch the electrics to the other side of the ball or to have a longer necked tow_bar .
neutral	i opted of the latter and had to pay for the new tow_bar :-( to save towequipe cost and effort i opted to replace it myself .
neutral	on the face of it is really simple - my tools were not strong_enough so had to go to a friendly garage .
neutral	my thoughts are the towequipe should have known that the towbar and bike_rack couldn_'_t work together and advised me accordingly .
neutral	i bought an in tank fuel_pump assembly for an s00 blazer i had for sale labor to install $_000 ( about average for this type of job ) i sold the truck , pump went bad in less_than 00 days and only 000_miles !
neutral	left the customer on the side of the road .
neutral	i e_mailed them and got no response for 0 days !!!
neutral	customers cant_wait they need their vehicle back the $_00 fuel_pump assembly cost me over $_000 before it was done !
neutral	they absolutely did not give a shit !
neutral	they reluctantly refunded my original purchase price 0_weeks_later .
neutral	only after i filed a complaint with e_bay .. buyer_beware avoid parts that are electrical in nature very cheaply_made in china junk !!
neutral	/ i have bought several radiators and condensers and have had good luck with those products ( so_far ).
neutral	they did not even offer a credit_towards labor !
neutral	another reason to buy local at your local parts store ... richard hamm owner tops unlimited erie pa . building custom cars since 0000
neutral	we went to look at and then purchase a small nest of tables at the metro centre gateshead branch .
neutral	couldn_'_t believe that there was none in stock ( ever ) and that all purchases get delivered by the van .
neutral	come on , were in store and want to give you some money and take home some small tables !!!
neutral	nearly walked because of this to go elsewhere .
neutral	the free delivery was up to a month but actually only took 00 days but they did offer a quicker method for a princely £_00 ( ouch ).
neutral	in store the sales lady was okay and over polite but tried and tried to sell us add_ons of a care kit for £_00 . 00 which really was way overpriced as it is a tin of polish and a couple of cloths in a fancy box .
neutral	got a tin of finest beeswax polish locally for £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the tables themselves however are excellent value and delivery was prompt courteous and they were very well_packaged .
neutral	point of sale was disapponting but the product itself is excellent value
neutral	the chat guy was helpful and i hope the router i ordered works as_advertised .
neutral	the time to rate a company is after you have received what you ordered and had it for a couple of years and it is working as_advertised .
neutral	until then , it '_s all supposition .
neutral	thanks for the help .
neutral	i '_ve been to your site a couple of times and it seems that each time trying to find a part for a make / model / year is difficult to do .
neutral	the categorization of the parts seems arbitary and search doesn_'_t help .
neutral	ordered the item over a week now .
neutral	still_hasn_'_t come .
neutral	the tracking said it went east , not west .
neutral	someone is having a problem with their directions !
neutral	good thing it '_s not a product that is essential that my pets have to have it or they '_ll be ill !
neutral	not too happy with the shipping dept .
neutral	we ordered online so can '_t rate the customer service people .
neutral	excellent service but fail to understand_why the price can vary by over £_00 within few_days .
neutral	i ordered strut and coil_spring assemblies for my jeep commander .
neutral	one of the strut_assemblies was put_together incorrectly .
neutral	we had to compress the spring and disassemble and reassemble in order to use it .
neutral	i also ordered shocks .
neutral	one of the shocks was dented , not pristine .
neutral	i wonder_if these parts didn_'_t pass q / a at the factory .
neutral	my past experiences with parts_geek have been 0_stars but not this time .
neutral	the coat is good but , the hood draw cords are not as shown on the web_site photo and the left_hand drawcord toggle does not hold the drawcord in place .
neutral	ordered battery advertised as " interstate " brand but battery received was from china with no_indication or labeling that it was an interstate .
neutral	possibly false_advertising ?
neutral	fast courtesy service but had to return right after tires were installed for a wheel balance .
neutral	bought this with a view to doing some mild exercise without having to go out etc .
neutral	easy to put_together in my opinion , with a nice wide seat and easy to read display .
neutral	two issues one minor one major
neutral	it would be rally good to have distance travelled as one of the fnctions on the led display .
neutral	( minor )
neutral	i am about 0 ft 0 and when pulling back i hiot the stops before fully extended at the legs ( major ).
neutral	anyone under six foot this machine will_definitely do the job
neutral	order # 00 - 0000000 .
neutral	ordered parts 0nd day for a weekend project .
neutral	two of the parts showed_up fine .
neutral	checked status of third and showed still processing a week_later .
neutral	requested that item to be cancelled and credited back but have not heard_anything yet .
neutral	after a long discussion the problem that i encountered with delivery of my worktops the situation was amicably resolved . many_thanks to those concerned .
neutral	great prices , shame about staff .
neutral	asked if u had a seat post shim 00 . 0 to 00 . 0 . are u sure that '_s not the outer diameter ?
neutral	been selling bikes for 00yrs and never_heard of that size post .
neutral	check cube bikes .
neutral	shim bought from crc .
neutral	reverb arrived .
neutral	this is my0rd post and kit arrived minus box , bleed kit and torx tool .
neutral	which should have been mentioned .
neutral	item was shipped in a reasonable_amount of time and arrived undamaged .
neutral	the importer of the part ( dorman ) needs to check with the manufacturer , as the part ( exhaust_manifold ) was typical chinese " half fast " quality .
neutral	item had to be ground to fit and surface ground for flatness .
neutral	egr port not exactly in the right place either .
neutral	had to bend tube slightly to get to fit_properly .
neutral	parts_geek is not the manufacturer and i '_m sure they would have exchanged part but extra_cost in return shipping would have wiped out any savings in ordering part online instead of buying at local parts store .
neutral	ordered pool_chemicals from doheny due to their next_day delivery .
neutral	half of the chemicals came the next_day .
neutral	more arrived the following_day , however not all .
neutral	one week_later , the remainder of the order had still not arrived .
neutral	i contacted doheny via_e_-_mail through their " contact us " link , with no response .
neutral	after one additional week i contacted doheny through the live_chat .
neutral	the representative said it appeared the chemicals had not shipped from the warehouse yet and i would receive the remainder of the order that week and quickly ended the chat .
neutral	the products did come that week , after 0 additional days .
neutral	if you are needing pool_chemicals with guaranteed next_day delivery , don_'_t bother with doheny .
neutral	thankfully , i did get the balance of my order , however , it would have been nice if i didn_'_t have to pester the company to ship my products and wouldn_'_t have had to wait 0_weeks for them to arrive .
neutral	i am confident if i hadn_'_t attempted to contact doheny , i would have never received the remainder of my order .
neutral	doheny , if you are going to claim next_day delivery , you should honor it .
neutral	** update - nancy from customer service called and apologized for the troubles i had with my order and customer service .
neutral	it makes me feel better to know that there are still companies out there that care if they lose their customers .
neutral	i '_ve changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars .
neutral	i had to pick_up the part from a freight company because it was too difficult to arrange for delivery .
neutral	after unpacking it i found it damaged .
neutral	i '_m pretty sure i can straighten it out .
neutral	still ... good product at a good price .
neutral	parts came , were in good shape , and were cheap , but they also came an entire week_later than parts ordered the same day from a different sight .
neutral	they were also two_days_later than their shipment tracker told me they would be .
neutral	unfortunately the shipping company refused to fulfill our delivery , even_though tractor trailers deliver revelry day on this island .
neutral	prior to actual date of delivery they were told thattt '_s couldn_'_t make the turn into the subdivision and a smaller delivery truck no larger than a bus would work .
neutral	we were told no problem they handle all_kinds .
neutral	as a result of the delivery company failing to do their job the safe was returned .
neutral	teresa was excellent in dealing_with the issues and refunding our full purchase price .
neutral	i am a huge_fan of southampton airport and since the creation of the priority parking area i can spend more time at work before departing .
neutral	however last few visits my car has shared the space with a flock of small birds .
neutral	the birds do what birds do and the result is a car that resembles a dung heap .
neutral	sort it out guys .
neutral	my order was received , processed and despatched promptly and efficiently , but days and days went by and it never arrived .
neutral	i contacted them to discuss this , and it appears that the courier tried to deliver whilst i was out , but instead of letting_me know about the package , they decided to sit on it and keep it to themselves .
neutral	this was eventually resolved by my switch shop , who were genuinely very helpful , and my order did finally arrive in excellent condition , however , i urge you not to go to anywhere_near this company until they start to use a decent , reasonable courier firm .
neutral	excellent as far as arrangements for collection of cd '_s disappointed that no reason was given on why payment was made .
neutral	this not to much of a problem with a 00 p cd however with a £ 0 cd and nothing given i would have preffered to have the cd back but i was not given the option .
neutral	i will try somewhere_else next time
neutral	the muffler i ordered arrived with lots of dents .
neutral	since i don_'_t think it will affect performance i kept it anyway .
neutral	one of the gaskets i ordered for it was the wrong_size by 0 / 0 " and it had to go to a local_auto store to get the correct one .
neutral	also i like to paint the muffler with high temperature paint before installing it , but i spent at_least 0 / 0 hour trying to get all the shipping labels off the metal .
neutral	they could have been applied to the cardboard wrapper instead of the pipe .
neutral	one annoying exception was the promotion for the free discount club membership .
neutral	turns_out they will deduct $_00 .
neutral	from your credit_card after the free 00 day trial_period .
neutral	seems like the old bait and switch subversive tactic .
neutral	they should declare that stipulation up front , not after you click on try it free for 00 days .
neutral	i think it '_s a great idea but i have one issue .
neutral	there is a lack of communication after the order is placed .. after the order is place i received an_email that the order is in processing but then never_heard that the order was complete and out for delivery
neutral	our only issue was the beds .
neutral	we asked for 0 queen_beds and there was no way these were queen_beds in the room , which_meant our nights_sleep was not good at all .
neutral	these were definately full size beds and not queen .... there is a difference !
neutral	booking was easy and the person i talked to was professional and knew what he was doing .
neutral	however , when i got my change card bill there were two $ 0 charges made at the same time as the hotel charge .
neutral	when i called visa , i was told they were probably transaction charges .
neutral	this is not a problem ; but i was not told that there would a transaction charge .
neutral	very pleased with goods i ordered but 0 phone_calls to you were ignored . you did not notify me of delivery date i ordered sunday did not receive my goods until thursday .
neutral	the website and ordering_process are well thought out and easy to use .
neutral	particularly like the repeat order function , the ease of use makes it more likely for me to use the site again .
neutral	delivery is quick and reliable , tho postal service did mess up one delivery and had to pick_up from depot .
neutral	did not appreciate receiving recent £ 0 gift voucher for a friend '_s first purchase and nothing for my loyalty ( 0 orders on ), this only encourages me to shop around .
neutral	hi .
neutral	it was frustrating that the computer had a flight and a specific airfare but when you went to book , it kicked it out and put in another flight at a higher cost .
neutral	it feel_like i was scammed by a bait and switch tactic and ended_up paying almost $_000 . 00 more .
neutral	speed was there but not so much for quality .
neutral	there were a couple of inadequately translated words and formatting issues .
neutral	this was for a 0 page japanese family registry ( charged as 0 pages ) which should have been relatively easy to handle .
neutral	i am having the translated document_translated again to korean .
neutral	the korean translator asked me to review ( which the other translator didn_'_t even bother ) and i ended_up fixing a fair amount of the work only to find out the initial job was not thoroughly executed to begin with ....
neutral	they often do not place their deliveries in an inconspicuous spot near the door .
neutral	instead , they leave it right in the open on the welcome mat so everyone who passes by sees it .
neutral	if this is the shipper used most of the time , i likely will not purchase from pet_flow again .
neutral	if this can be addressed to the ontrac carriers to better place the deliveries in general in a less obvious spot near the door , i may reconsider .
neutral	so i have to have the merchandise sent to my friend in az and have them send it to me .
neutral	this is a magir pain in the butt .
neutral	i '_ve done it twice_now .
neutral	i would pay the extra shipping just to know i will get premium products .
neutral	i don_'_t really get it .
neutral	i '_m still in the usa
neutral	0 days at 0 . 00 ea -- plus $_00 in " taxes ".
neutral	it '_s only after you '_ve paid you find out that more than half of that is " service fees ".
neutral	otherwise good : sign in office , quick sign in , shuttle on time .
neutral	shuttle makes several stops , so " 0 mile ride to airport " takes about 00_minutes .
neutral	i had to call because there was a problem with theme park tickets and they couldn_'_t pull up my itinerary .
neutral	that is of course after i had to wait 00_minutes to talk to someone .
neutral	then they had me redo everything and the prices weren_'_t as good , so i just hung_up and re did on line without the theme park tickets and got what i wanted .
neutral	with much_better results .
neutral	i was very happy with the product the only issue i had is it listed 0 warehouses and well until i placed the order i wasn_'_t sure where it was coming from .
neutral	the order was a week getting to me and we had to rent a car till the parts arrived .
neutral	generally not bad service , however annoyed that the first delivery attempt didn_'_t even happen due to ' check of address '.
neutral	apparently the driver struggled to find an address which has_been used several_times before and is at the front of an established residential estate .
neutral	i suspect it was a case of ' ran_out of time and wanted to go home ' as the delivery made perfectly well on the monday .
neutral	i accept delays and time restrictions uk mail , but not bs excuses .
neutral	i ordered my oil delivery on the 0th of this month and recieved a call for delivery to be made on the 00th
neutral	no delivery came , had a call it was going to be delivered on the 00th i had someone waiting in all day
neutral	" no delivery or phone_call "
neutral	after waiting i chased delivery on the 00th and was told lorry had broken down and delivery will now be 00th and it arrived .
neutral	i am dissapointed by no communication and the amount of time wasted waiting for my delivery ....
neutral	this is not the first time i have had boiler_juice problems and i am now considering using another route for my oil orders
neutral	i received the wrong_size wheel caps and had to return them at my expense .
neutral	this should not have happened since i furnished the vin_number .
neutral	they sent this form to me a day before the parts i ordered are expected to arrive , so it '_s pretty hard to rate .
neutral	they really should use the tracking data better to make_sure the customer experience is complete before customers are asked to rate their experience .
neutral	have been a member for a number of years .
neutral	why do i have to pay separately for the full credit_report ?
neutral	before they were part of membership .
neutral	will_certainly determine if i renew with identity_guard .
neutral	i ordered the two day delivery because i was sick and in need of a remedy .
neutral	i ordered on thursday and the product arrived on tuesday .
neutral	my order was quickly processed on thursday and put in the hands of the shipper on friday_evening as_advertised .
neutral	glasses are great but over $ dollars for lenses is really way too much
neutral	i think
neutral	the phone operator suggested the wrong_size .
neutral	now my stockings are too large .
neutral	if i wanted to return the order for a refund , i would only get a fiver , after i ' d paid for postage from ireland .
neutral	my advice : get verification of your size before you order
neutral	after installing the new screen ( which was really not very difficult ) and turning on the laptop , i noticed in the upper left_hand corner a very short red vertical mark that was present regardless of what was being displayed .
neutral	apparently the screens undergo no test prior to shipping .
neutral	i asked my daughter , for whom i had install the new screen , if the mark bothered her and she thought " she could live with it ."
neutral	were it mine , i would be annoyed .
neutral	however , she was simply happy to have her laptop operational again .
neutral	i booked a return flight to boston including hotel and car_rental .
neutral	after making the booking i downloaded the itinerary , the info on the hotel and car_rental .
neutral	i assumed they represented my ticket with southwest / airtran .
neutral	i did not read the fine_print that stated my tickets would be emailed to me .
neutral	as far as i know , they were not emailed to me .
neutral	fortunately for me , the airline , the hotel , and the car_rental had me in their system and issued boarding_passes , let_me stay at the hyatt , and provided me with a car from dollar .
neutral	so , everything_went ok , except for the fact that my checked bag did not make it onto the plane from baltimore to tampa .
neutral	the bag was delived to my home about 00_hours_later .
neutral	i thought the menslook site was nice to use , and appreciated the photos that were provided , and the information that accompanied them .
neutral	making a purchase was so easy , it became suspicious , and now i know why .
neutral	returns are not accepted ( although exchanges for store credit is ), and shipping is completely taken_care of by the company .
neutral	not covered , as i wondered , but taken_care of .
neutral	this means the consumer cannot chose shipping options ( like speedy or cost_effective delivery ), and furthermore does not even know how much the cost will be until ups shows up at your front_door requiring a check made out to menslook before handing_over the package .
neutral	this experience leaves a good initial flavor with a bad aftertaste .
neutral	i really hope the shoes i ordered fit , because they were the last pair available , in any size !
neutral	store credit just means i '_ve spent a lot of money on something else , while i still need to buy the shoes i actually want from another store .
neutral	tack on shipping_costs back and forth , and back again , and this could be a much more_expensive purchase than it originally appeared to be !
neutral	purchasing clothing and footwear without being_able to try it on first inevitably means some incorrect sizes will be bought .
neutral	it comes with the territory of online buying .
neutral	but store and customer should share these expected burdens to some degree .
neutral	i think the system / experience would be much improved if full returns were possible , and / or shipping_costs were covered .
neutral	putting all these costs on the customer leads to a much more weary buyer ....
neutral	i question the analyzer tool .
neutral	when i look at several options , the potential score seems to be incorrect , or at_least that is the feeling i get .
neutral	example : pay off a small balance debt , score goes up by x points , pay off a larger one , score goes up but by fewer points .
neutral	pay both off , score goes up but not by as much as just paying off the higher of the two .
neutral	also , no option in the custom option to do more than one thing such as pay off balances and make payments on time for x number of months .
neutral	it has to be one of the other .
neutral	i cant really use the product as i thought i would be able to .
neutral	bookbyte provided a pretty good deal on the textbook rental ... however , it was supposed to come with a return_label which they did not provide ... i guess i have yet to see how easy it will be to return before the due date .
neutral	the windscreen was delivered fast but the windscreen did not fit_properly i had to grind out the holes bigger to fit which honestly was a pain and took some of the look away .
neutral	but as we '_ve heard before high shipping_costs .
neutral	even so the bottom_line is still good .
neutral	lets_see more shipping options with cheaper rates .
neutral	i am always able to find good prices or at_least a good match in my experience with supplementwarehouse , however , they should really consider investing in a website update .
neutral	the layout is poor , the tools and menus could be much_better , and it seems cumbersome .
neutral	it could be much more user_friendly experience .
neutral	good service and very reliable
neutral	great mileage ( about 00mpg ).
neutral	small which worked for us ( 0 people ) i had already decided not to go down to london .
neutral	furthest trip we took was to llangollen for the international eisteddfod , every time we came to an incline i had to downshift to 0 nd .
neutral	( it was a manual 0 speed ).
neutral	so .... great for what we wanted , upgrade if you are going to travel any distance !
neutral	our past experience with auto_europe has_been good using europa car .
neutral	renting from hertz was not such a good experience .
neutral	when we rent from europa car we have a choice of a few car models .
neutral	the one we received at hertz was a corsa , the seat were very uncomfortable .
neutral	we had to buy pillows and even then we experienced severe cramps and leg pain .
neutral	we would of booked a upgrade if we had known there was not a choice of models .
neutral	no winter_tires and snow chain only for optional
neutral	one front bulb missing
neutral	something not included like " oneri circolazione autoveicoli "
neutral	i left my car with stress_free parking for 0 days .
neutral	dropping_off the car was fine .
neutral	however picking_up the car was not stress_free .
neutral	the car was late in coming_back .. when i called the number the chap said he was ' not a clairvoyant ' and could not confirm how much longer i ' d have to wait .
neutral	he then hung_up .
neutral	when the car eventually came back , the boot was muddy and there was dirt on the inside , on the armrest .
neutral	the good : 0 % pricematch , tough to beat that .
neutral	the misleading : tons of free crap to choose from .
neutral	i never choose the free stuff , not even the shaker , adding the shaker to the order increases shipping cost by just over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the bad : sales_tax in wi .
neutral	shipping is usually more_expensive than bodybuilding . com .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find a working promocode to enter , i have never had that problem with bodybuilding . com .
neutral	for very heavy orders bodybuilding . com blows sw out of the water on shipping_charges .
neutral	overall i keep_coming_back because i live in wi , so i recieve the order very fast .
neutral	the price ( including shipping +_tax ) is usually a couple dollars cheaper_than bodybuilding . com , and that is using the pricematch feature .
neutral	not sure if this has any significance but ; i ordered some lg sciences lipotropic protein from bodybuilding . com , taste amazing .
neutral	ordered it from sw ( twice ), taste horrible .
neutral	we booked and paid for a queen suite at our hotel in north dakota .
neutral	when we arrived , the room was not a suite at all .
neutral	i called travelocity after finally finding a phone_number for them .
neutral	they had me on hold for about 00_minutes while they called the hotel , then came back to offer moving us to a different location .
neutral	it was well after midnight , so this wasn_'_t a real option for us .
neutral	the travelocity representative , who was polite and understandable , said to take it up with the hotel manager in the morning because it was the hotel '_s fault .
neutral	i did just that , and was told that travelocity had booked us for the suite four days after all the suites had been reserved by others , so i would have to take it up with travelocity .
neutral	a couple days_later , i once again called travelocity and told them what the manager told me .
neutral	this time my representative was very hard to understand , and it took several explanations to make her understand what had happened .
neutral	again , i was put on hold while she called the hotel , this time for over 00_minutes .
neutral	she came back on and said that the difference in rate between the suite we booked and the room we got would be refunded to us by the hotel .
neutral	she also offered to put a $_00 coupon into our travelocity account .
neutral	i had booked the room as a guest , so she offered to create an account for me and said that she would send the confirmation_email once that was done .
neutral	days passed , and i never did receive any more contact from her .
neutral	it turns_out the account was created , and i was able to access it , and the coupon had been added as_promised .
neutral	i was disappointed with the overbooking , and also disappointed with the lack of follow - through on travelocity '_s side .
neutral	it also would have been nice had they offered to call me back after_contacting the hotel each time rather_than make me wait for so long on hold .
neutral	we had a place to stay , and the coupon they gave_us was fine , but a better solution would be for them to keep better tabs on what rooms are actually available .
neutral	i wrote to you to request information about my rather large order , got a text back that i will get a response in 00 - 00_hrs ... that was about 0 days ago .
neutral	no response
neutral	i was sent an_email_saying myproduct had been dispatched saturday but it only arrived today when i paid for 0 - 0 days delivery and it took 0 days too arrive !
neutral	i had to go a day without_any protein .
neutral	not happy !
neutral	let_down by a lot of poor content
neutral	i onkly wish they came in other colors as this weave material looks very bizarre .
neutral	also , the velcro closures are a bit funky .
neutral	the app is awful because for most users it doesn_'_t work properly .
neutral	the mobile site is equally problematic .
neutral	our attempts to establish the expected time of delivery failed .
neutral	the promised automated delivery email did not arrive .
neutral	the customer service adviser was unable to contact the driver to establish his expected arrival time and as a result we spent most of the morning waiting in vain .
neutral	eventually the customer service adviser claimed to have contacted the driver and gave an expected arrival of 0 pm .
neutral	we left a mobile number for the driver to call when he was within half an_hour of arrival , and went out shopping .
neutral	on our return at 0 . 00 ( having not receive a mobile call ) we found the delivery vehicle in the drive and no sign of the driver , who had gone off into the village to see if he could find us .
neutral	he had called our landline number as our mobile number had not been relayed to him .
neutral	the driver was polite and helpful and the the remainder of our experience was fine .
neutral	you have to pay extra shipping on something like 0 capsule that you know can '_t weigh more than 0 / 0 oz ., but raises the shipping cost by $ 0 .
neutral	if you can get a coupon that works , or buy products that say free shipping on entire order , you are doing better .
neutral	otherwise , the pricing is good on most of their products .
neutral	i ordered a simple winch cover from 0wdh and waited a month then emailed them and they finally told me it was back ordered another 0 months .
neutral	their customer service should inform their customers on delays when they know it .
neutral	customers shouldn_'_t have to ask .
neutral	i was happy with the service the ease of finding parts , the fast deliverly , the one and only_thing that dissapointed me was the fact that the part was made in taiwan
neutral	i called for a part for my auto which is in costa_rica .
neutral	and was told that the replacement part was not avaleabe but the part made by isuzu was .
neutral	ask for price and was told 000 . 00 new price , but when i received the part it showed marks on it where it had been taken off of a trany also showed marks of wear and tear for it was a used part but i paid new price .
neutral	i feel that i was not handled fairly .
neutral	i gave an okay rating as i had asked to be contacted once the flowers had arrived , i was not .
neutral	everything else about the service was fine .
neutral	overall good car , clean , no break downs .
neutral	main negative is after queing at the desk for paperwork , had to go to another location and que again for well over an_hour , so very slow .
neutral	i ordered 0 items , a grill insert and a radiator .
neutral	i wasn_'_t advised how long it would take to get them shipped until i had already paid .
neutral	the grill arrived in a few_days but is poor quality .
neutral	the radiator arrived in about 0 business days ( 0 to 0 stated as possible ) and appears to be good .
neutral	website was not user_friendly and never did get a deal explained as free shipment sign - up .
neutral	not sure i would use them again , where quality finish was a concern anyway .
neutral	the item sent by the post_office came right_away .
neutral	the other item was sent by fed - ex .
neutral	my experience with them has_been a package can arrive here in the nearby facility & sit for a few_days , delaying delivery .
neutral	very poor service & doesnt reflect well on you .
neutral	price is great but 00 . 00 to ship to kansas_city 0 lbs of goods ?
neutral	i added frees stuff at the end and it doubled the shipping .
neutral	not cool .
neutral	champion search_engine .
neutral	but i don_'_t like google '_s new privacy_policy though .
neutral	they shouldn_'_t have done it .
neutral	the website was helpful but we needed to do some extra homework on each of the suggested places .
neutral	it was lovely to have a few different payment_options because we are booking with a group of 0 , and we needed to spread it out .
neutral	the one problem was that we couldn_'_t reserve our seats on the airplane .
neutral	we had to do that through the airline and we were charged on one of the flights for preferred seating .
neutral	or we would have been randomly assigned seats .
neutral	there was a short guy with short black hair that helped_me .
neutral	in my opinion he did everything in the book wrong .
neutral	he spoke to fast
neutral	he mumbled
neutral	he went to my car without a pen ready
neutral	i purchased 0 tires and he asked me if i want them in the front or back .
neutral	i asked_him what i should do .
neutral	he suggested the front .
neutral	then i paid and had to sign something stating that i should put them in the rear .
neutral	the worst thing he did was kept asking me questions that he shouldn_'_t ask right out of the gate .
neutral	a good salesman takes the customer for and enjoyable conversation starting with the current problem , what the options are , and what he recommends .
neutral	then you ask the question .
neutral	at the same time there was a different guy that was a perfect employee .
neutral	he spoke properly , remembered me even_though i wasn_'_t his customer , seemed knowledgable .
neutral	i almost told my salesman to just stop and let_me talk to this other guy .
neutral	one last thing .
neutral	tell the bad employee to pull up his pants .
neutral	is that even in fashion any more ?
neutral	0 of 0 plants received last_week appear to be healthy .
neutral	one plant arrived out of its container and appears to be dying .
neutral	0 of the plants are smaller and not as healthy as the best 0 .
neutral	sent several emails and got no response .
neutral	also traking details failed to update so had no_idea if parcel was sent .
neutral	when i arrived at the parking_lot the very friendly van_driver told me to go to the office to take_care of the paperwork while he would take_care of my bag .
neutral	when i returned i found that my car trunk was empty and the van was gone !
neutral	fortunately , he hadn_'_t gone very far and when another driver contacted him , he came right back .
neutral	needless to say , i had several anxious minutes .
neutral	aside from that , the service was fine .
neutral	i love this site ; however , i have had some bad_experiences with their shipping and warehouse departments .
neutral	i order a few things at at time and when i recurve my orders sometimes there would be a couple things that weren_'_t in stock , so i always had to contact them , because they wouldn_'_t contact me .
neutral	i have been very disappointed a couple times , but i have also been very satisfied too .
neutral	i guess it '_s a hit and miss sometimes for me .
neutral	i can not get a credit_score with identity_guard but i can with several competitors .
neutral	my credit record is thin but how can they come up with a estimated score and identity_guard cannot ?
neutral	i find this a bit frustrating .
neutral	yellow jacket sent the wrong color hose .
neutral	i like to order supplies on a just requarted bases .
neutral	i just ordered some wipes that did not arrive on time .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will order from healthy kin again .
neutral	it got to my apartment in 0days .
neutral	my customer service experience with onnit has_been superb and shipping was super_fast .
neutral	however , after about 0 week of using alpha_brain and new_mood i can '_t tell if the supplements are working the way onnit says they are supposed to work .
neutral	i haven_'_t noticed much of a change from taking the 0 supplements , but i will_continue to use the 0 bottles i have bought then wait and see how the onnit products work for me after further use .
neutral	late june visit in the afternoon .
neutral	buses were packed and often standing room only .
neutral	i felt_like i was on a city bus .
neutral	the management needs to monitor the number of riders and adjust buses accordingly .
neutral	remember , this is a big_bus_tour , not just a hop on hop_off bus ride .
neutral	guides were humorous and pleasant , although when in the bus were inaudible .
neutral	got the correct part oem part for my mercedes , much_cheaper that from the dealer .
neutral	paid for 0 day shipping , someone messed_up , it took 0 days to get to my house !!
neutral	however i will use again because how much_cheaper the part was
neutral	price was great but i was under the impression it was gonna come out of closest wharhouse which i thought was in nj but instead it shipped out of ca and took over a week to get here .
neutral	hello my order has not arrived please check gm000000000000000000
neutral	sometimes buses are really full .
neutral	in front of the tower of london so much people waited that they only fitted in 0 buses .
neutral	audio is good .
neutral	worth when you do a roundtrip without exiting the bus .
neutral	not to use when you have appointments ( like madame tussauds ) because you never know how long it takes you to get there .
neutral	we agreed that we '_ll not do it again .
neutral	you have to buy tube tickets anyway and it '_s faster
neutral	good would that can change the form of payment that is not always euro ...
neutral	think ....
neutral	bought flowers for my mother for her_birthday . the flowers turned_up on time and my mum said they were packaged beautifully . when i saw the flowers i was a bit disappointed as i ordered them off of the internet by picture only not names etc , and they did not look like the picture . they were the same colour as expected but not as full as picture . 0 days_later and my mother has said that the flowers have all opened up and they look lovely . i have another bunch being delivered monday for my wife so will leave_feedback about them also
neutral	i have changed my address in my preferences repeatedly to try and get my billing_address to appear correctly , when checking out , yet you still show my old address .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	i was given a great price for my sunglasses but i am almost certain they are a factory blemish item .
neutral	i '_m almost certain this is the case because i purchase persol exclusively and have never had this issue before .
neutral	there is residue / rough areas that appear to have been caused during manufacture and the plastic bridge , which is meant to be flexible , is completely split .
neutral	thankfully persol molds metal frames into the plastic so they aren_'_t broken in half .
neutral	was very impressed by the turnaround and ease of ordering until i realized that the order arrived without a vase .
neutral	the picture had a vase and i was only prompted for the opportunity to add chocolates and balloons which i thought was a really nice_touch .
neutral	it was only after the fact when i went back onto your website that i realize that i made the mistake and should have ordered that vase in addition to the flowers .
neutral	very best regards and hope this helps
neutral	there is no better product , period .
neutral	that '_s why my family spend thousands of dollars a year on vital_choice salmon and tuna .
neutral	now here is the bad part : there is no reward program for heavy buyers .
neutral	if you are on their mailing_list ( and have ordered once ) you get their weekly offer .
neutral	but heavy repeat_customers deserve more than that .
neutral	worse , when i asked , i was essentially told to take a hike .
neutral	these are very rude people who take loyal_customers for granted .
neutral	i even took the time to email the ceo , but received no reply .
neutral	if i ever find a better product , i '_ll be gone in a heartbeat and i '_ll never come_back .
neutral	the exchange_rate is not very impressive considering that we are already paying fee .
neutral	the price is good and shipment is really fast .
neutral	however , they missed one part in the first shipment and send the missing one to a wrong_address .
neutral	the battery works great and it was fairly easy to install , pretty_much plug and play .
neutral	also dorman has a great install video on their web_site .
neutral	however the shipping crate was very carefully duct taped and i couldn_'_t tell if it was shipped that way or damaged by fed - ex until opening the crate .
neutral	after removing the duct_tape i could see they used tiny butt hinges for the lid and they had been ripped out of the wood and the lid was only held on by the latch and the duct_tape .
neutral	( fyi to partsgeek and dorman ; fed_ex only had one guy on the truck and this thing is heavy all of the dorman install videos show 0 guys handling the crate and battery ) so i didn_'_t refuse the shipment as partsgeek says to do if there is shipping damage and fed_ex was long gone before i opened the crate .
neutral	fyi to partsgeek and dorman ; strap hinges would solve the hinge problem .
neutral	i '_m putting some on to ship it back as it is my responsibility that it gets there undamaged .
neutral	also bolting the battery to the bottom of the crate could help .
neutral	the battery appeared to be undamaged so i installed it and everything worked well except there was some minor sheet_metal damage on one end that wasn_'_t noticeable until the battery was in the car .
neutral	i was able to straighten it out fairly easily .
neutral	it appeared the damage was caused_by setting the crate on end .
neutral	it was the passenger_side of the battery that had been pushed in as some of the bolt_holes didn_'_t line up .
neutral	all i had to do was pry the sheet_metal over to align the mounting_holes .
neutral	it would probably be helpful if the crate were marked keep flat this side up .
neutral	of course all the paperwork was missing so i had no installation_instructions , no rma , and no shipping instructions .
neutral	i contacted partsgeek and they e_- mailed an_rma_# and instructions to me .
neutral	( note_: 0 - 0 days to get an e_-_mail response ) talking to a human in customer service is not an option .
neutral	so i '_m hoping to get my $_000 + core fee back but it sounds_like that may take a month after they receive the core .
neutral	also i have to pay the return shipping on 000_pounds .
neutral	so it may have been worth spending the extra $_000 with no return shipping and getting it from o ' reilly '_s in one day and have the core fee returned to immediately .
neutral	brick and mortar still has some advantages .
neutral	i '_ll look a lot closer at the actual costs involved before i buy again online .
neutral	when i called up the hotel site for confirmation the number provided by travelocity did not work .
neutral	i had to call the hotel personally to confirm .
neutral	stauntons on the green is a very friendly and well located hotel in dublin , ireland .
neutral	it would be good for someone_who only needs a place to sleep , nothing more .
neutral	the hotel is very old ( but clean ) and has a spartan level of service .
neutral	we didn_'_t know that there were no elevators until we arrived .
neutral	we are 00 years old and carrying our own luggage three flights was hard .
neutral	good location though .
neutral	good easy to use site with prompt delivery and great customer service
neutral	great products & prices , not always next_day delivery !
neutral	recently booked series of on - line planer tickets for a group of 0 going to europe on a ten day trip .
neutral	travelocity had great prices the booking process ran real smooth , including the seat selection airline departure times and airports and the linked car_rental .
neutral	the reason i stated that it wasn_'_t intuitive was the location on the print - out the seat numbers , passenger names , airports and dates were easy to find however the flite numbers were " hidden away " so to speak in small_print on the printouts .
neutral	little_bit of buzz kill when you get to a large airport and your staring up at the monitors trying to figure_out what '_s my flite , which gate etc .
neutral	not user_friendly , to many blank areas , needs improvements .
neutral	i ordered parts from this guys they send the parts fast good selection but other auto_parts have free shipping on everything
neutral	i '_ve bought from banglads a few_times , always a positive_experience with high_quality products .
neutral	this time i was disappointed , because i chose the dfd next_day delivery service and it didn_'_t come up to scratch .
neutral	if i ' d chosen any of the other premium delivery options i ' d have had my new swimwear for my holiday .
neutral	choosing dfd meant i didn_'_t .
neutral	my advice : choose royal_mail if you need next_day delivery .
neutral	the number of places could be better and for the love of god , fix your iphone_app !
neutral	way to slow needs to speed up and have faster payment too .
neutral	waited way to long with faster payment system it should only take 0h to get money in my a /_c .
neutral	powerhouse has some great kit at fantastic prices .
neutral	just don_'_t be in a rush for your goods and be prepared to chase them .
neutral	prices offered are very low regardless of competitors prices and market rates , also i did not write a review as requested to do so in order to receive these type of responses from envirofine , i simply voiced my opinion as requested to do so .
neutral	at last the curtains that i had first ordered , good fit good quality .
neutral	but #_000000 still pending i cant cancel , you cant either , i do not want these lets_see what you can do !!
neutral	!
neutral	renewing your loans and taking out available credit is smooth and easy , however , they are pretty stingy with their credit limits .
neutral	i like this vv device but was rather dissapointed it only came with one battery and the charger was european .
neutral	luckily ive been vaping for a while now so was able to use it instantly using gear i have .
neutral	if it was my first and only p . v and had it say as a gift , i would of been disapointed no juice , one battery , charger no good without an adapter , no drip tip or tip whatsoever even the disposable tip would have done .
neutral	i was going to buy three more of these for family and friends as a start up kit but went for the ego instead .
neutral	simply cause you get the whole set_up , straight out of the box with samples of juice for them to try .......
neutral	as for the lava tube it is an excellent device works really well with my bulli and other attys for that matter .
neutral	its really well built the 00000 battery last me 0 days no_complaints whatsoever with the tube just not so good as a start up kit at_least not as it came out of the box .....
neutral	there was also an easter special that they offered 00_%_off a week after i ordered it .
neutral	they did not apply the special to the controller .
neutral	i like the set_up for end of auctions .
neutral	i would prefer if they categorised the whisk ( e ) y rather_than high / low bids .
neutral	i wish the postage prices were more like whiskyauctions . com but the packaging is excellent , probably bomb proof .
neutral	i can see where the costs is in fairness .
neutral	i wonder is there room for more whisky plinths and other related items other than bottles .
neutral	i seem to get a lot of activity notifications with very little explanation or not really knowing what they mean .
neutral	i talked to customer care people and they don_'_t really seem to know what some of the notifications mean either so i just keep getting them .
neutral	part looks good .
neutral	installed and working .
neutral	too early to tell .
neutral	ground_shipping just took too_long .
neutral	the rental of our vehicle went fairly smoothly and the cost was quite reasonable , i guess that '_s why the outside of the vehicle had some dents and scratches .
neutral	we were given a list of visible damage to the outside of the car to check for accuracy when we collected the car .
neutral	our car had a broken_tail_light , which wasn_'_t listed , and no one from the agency was in the kiosk at the location .
neutral	we had to walk back to the airport ( it was too complicated to drive there ) to get an employee to look at the vehicle .
neutral	not too much of a problem , but i didn_'_t like the fact that the inside of the vehicle wasn_'_t cleaned properly .
neutral	the inside of the windshield was grimy as was the dashboard , etc .
neutral	not appealing to me , but might not bother someone_else .
neutral	glad northshore still carried the abena abri - form diaper , must other_sites are out of stock .
neutral	price was fair with a coupon for free shipping .
neutral	i wish they offered free shipping all the time , like their competition does .
neutral	i '_ve stopped ordering your chicken_breasts .
neutral	reason : the last two orders haven_'_t had any ice cooling packs ... one there wasn_'_t room , instead of packing into two boxes with ice , it was all crammed into one box ... just short of 000_pounds order ...!!!
neutral	my last order , there was room but still no cooling packs ...
neutral	i thought i was accessing my hotels booking desk direct .
neutral	turns_out it was resevationcounter .
neutral	the cost difference_between going direct and using this service , for the same room , was over $ 00us .
neutral	plus going direct to the hotel i can cancel without_penalty if my plans_change .
neutral	it was ok just pricey
neutral	getting my parts fast is what i need the price of parts are good
neutral	just shipping time needs work ...... my last order took way to long .
neutral	good website and email_updates .
neutral	flowers were reported as beautiful and good to see a photo of the product on the website .
neutral	however they were picked via the wedding_anniversary tab so it was disappointing for me that my wife received them at 0pm !
neutral	bookit '_s price was so low that ramada themselves pulled a scam on me & wouldn_'_t pricematch their own price to bookit '_s price which was the lowest i could find !
neutral	reviews on bookit / bbb issues are very very high on issues which makes me uneasey , but as long as i get my hotel i '_m happy !
neutral	the autokey_system is fantastic , but the anti_- fraud system however , is slow , sluggish and dumb .
neutral	if you could speed up the sms feature it ' d be fantastic .
neutral	i like this company , but i wish they had removed the advertised support for rixty as a payment before they removed it from their site .
neutral	i phoned customer_support who courteously greeted me and informed me they no_longer support rixty and they were going to remove the advertisement from their site .
neutral	unfortunately since rixty was advertised i funded my rixty account so i could buy something that was on sale .
neutral	so i am now sitting with a rixty balance i did not need when my original intention was to use up the balance in my rixty account .
neutral	bought a clutch_kit for toyota_tacoma $_000 plus , mechanic thought at first defective , tried to get rma could not get the form .
neutral	frustrating as truck was in the air .
neutral	no human voice to talk to .
neutral	was not defective just new engineering .
neutral	problem ... no one to talk with , no referral phone_number .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	in comparison to other similar auction_sites .. buyer '_s premium and other post auction expenses are quite high .
neutral	however the format of the auction and information provided to bidders on bidding history etc is quite good .
neutral	just trying to get my head around this .
neutral	i had to pay a booking_fee but i did it online .
neutral	i haven_'_t asked anyone to help me , i did it all by myself ( like a big boy ) but iv been charged a booking_fee ,,,,,,, so , who mgets this money ???
neutral	?
neutral	location to airport ( manchester ) is fine , yes would use again if they get_rid of this booking_fee ..................!
neutral	will never understand_why company '_s do this .
neutral	it '_s online .
neutral	i did it myself .
neutral	if i wasn_'_t happy then iv only got myself to blame !!
neutral	!
neutral	i can '_t fault the order process and deliver of parts to my house .
neutral	i also took the option of mobile home fitting which was certainly required for the electrics programming for my car .
neutral	this turned_out to be a nightmare , difficulty booking then last_minute cancellations .
neutral	anyway after about 0_weeks finally done and a good job .
neutral	i would love to review this item , however i have not received it yet .
neutral	tracking indicates it was shipped on 00 / 00 / 0000 and it is now 00 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	shipping point was in new_jersey and i reside in central pennsylvania .
neutral	i could have walked there and returned in less time .
neutral	please do not ship fedex .
neutral	when i ordered the oil , it said up to 0 days , 0 - 00 days etc .
neutral	confirmation came through as 0 - 00 working days .
neutral	this could be 0 extra days .
neutral	it needs sorting_out on the original_quote .
neutral	i ordered a pc from dino_pc which was , according to them , rated at 0 . 0ghz .
neutral	however every test i '_ve run on it suggests that the real clock speed is 0 . 0ghz .
neutral	on querying this i was given the runaround and my complaint was never followed through .
neutral	no_complaints about the build or the delivery , although the latter is needlessly expensive , but customer service could do with a reboot .
neutral	i was pleased with the amount of produce for the amount paid , however on the website it clearly shows ice blocks , insulated wrap and more ice blocks .
neutral	when i received mine however it just had one lot of melted ice blocks at the bottom .
neutral	i ordered alpha_brain and am_currently using it , the product seems promising but in order to achieve maximum efficacy , in my opinion , 0 - 0 capsules are needed per day .
neutral	at this rate a 00 pill product , costing $_00 +, lasts just over 0 days .
neutral	if one wanted to use this a month it would run ~ $_000 , and for a year ~$ 0 , 000 .
neutral	this is just too much money for what it is , i understand a premium should be placed on the correct organization / stack of vitamins / nutrients but to what end ?
neutral	great site !
neutral	parts damaged both_times i ordered only down_side
neutral	the bib sizing by height ( only ) is confusing .
neutral	i purchased the bib for my height , but because i have a longer torso ( relative to my legs ) the bib was ridiculously tight .
neutral	i had to go through a return and repurchase process .
neutral	better information on sizing would be extremely_helpful .
neutral	other than that , the web_site works well .
neutral	the poster was mailed unrolled in a plastic sleeve wrapped in thin_cardboard .
neutral	a poster tube probably would have cost around the same for them to ship and the poster wouldn_'_t be bent up .
neutral	certainly not the nicest place in the world but overall the service was good .
neutral	the walls are pretty thin and don_'_t do much to block the sounds from neighbors or outside .
neutral	with thanksgiving coming up , i " look_forward " to watching more stories of people getting crushed in walmart stampedes .
neutral	the only good thing about walmart is prices .
neutral	everything else is not good - their employees are often rude , many cheap goods are truly cheap , which is to say of low quality .
neutral	can '_t rate them more than 0_stars .
neutral	need more distribution centers .
neutral	i have ordered twice and both shipments have taken 0 business days to receive .
neutral	site did not allow for any other quicker shipping options .
neutral	ordering product from west_coast yet shipments are from east_coast .
neutral	you don_'_t know this at time of order .
neutral	on a positive note , site is user_friendly and pricing is good .
neutral	the delivery were bad .
neutral	i had to drive 00 km to pick it up at schenkers terminal although i have a service point 000 meeters from my home .
neutral	apperently they wern '_t able to deliver to their own partner ....
neutral	i was not happy with the timeliness of the delivery ( and no notification that it was not delivered on time ) or the selection of flowers that was delivered .
neutral	customer service was good about responding to my inquiry , but basically just gave excuses for why the order was not as_advertised .
neutral	i would recommend finding a local_florist and going through them instead of using eflorist .
neutral	that is what i will do next time i have to send flowers .
neutral	customer service was great .
neutral	the website was easy to navigate , but i was unpleasantly surprised to receive 0 bags of dirt when what i had ordered were 0 0 - gallon trees .
neutral	i planted the piles of dirt ( presumably the roots are in there , somewhere ) and i am hoping for the best .
neutral	the website is a greart idea for european train tickets .
neutral	mostly satisfied with the experience .
neutral	you can avoid service charges by using a debit rather_than debit_card , plus you get the best exchange_rate .
neutral	however , there was no brekdown of cost , so i don_'_t know what value a senior discount provided versus a regular ticket .
neutral	as there are two seniors and one adult in our group , this seemed to confuse the website initially .
neutral	the courier didn_'_t seem to have a clue where he was going and had to ring me a few_times .
neutral	all i ordered was two small watch batteries and they came in a huge ridiculous size jiffy_bag / envelope .
neutral	i thought that was a bit silly .
neutral	i have no problem with the prices or the ease of using the website .
neutral	however , i received a part that was damaged either in shipping ( which i paid for ) or before it was shipped .
neutral	this damage made the part unusable .
neutral	i am now trying to get a replacement and send the damaged part back .
neutral	i cannot talk to anyone on the phone .
neutral	it is ridiculous to not have a way to contact partsgeek . com in any way but through email .
neutral	because of the delays caused_by this method , i am still without air_conditioning in my vehicle while living in las_vegas , nevada .
neutral	i am also a recovering open heart surgery patient driving without air .
neutral	this is not right .
neutral	tire sensor had a crack .
neutral	would appreciate another one .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	i '_ve used this company before and had no_problems .
neutral	the website is a little dated and you have to start search again if you want to look at alternative vehicles .
neutral	i ordered an suv but there are 0 types offered by the rental company '_s .
neutral	one is a '' standard '' and the other '' intermediate '' floridacarhire do not specify which one it is , however if you check the car type info it is apparent that it is the larger '' standard '' grade .
neutral	prices have been poor for the past 0 years and i have been ordering my vehicles elsewhere .
neutral	the prices currently are competetive so i have returned .
neutral	ordered these uv lamps and was informed they were not in stock , however payment had been taken .
neutral	it took about a month to receive them .
neutral	was disappointed that the company took severall prompts to answer my emails for delivery updates .
neutral	on the day i cancelled the order they were dispatched .
neutral	on the good side i could not buy these uv lamps in the uk , so very pleased i found someone_who could supply them .
neutral	reasonably prompt delivery but the hose didn_'_t fit the machine .
neutral	having asked how i go about an exchange i was told that i should return the hose for a refund .
neutral	my missus wanted a quick resolution to the untolerable ( in her mind ) absence of a cleaner so i have made the hose fit the machine with some mastic .
neutral	job_done .
neutral	the equipment was as expected .
neutral	the liftgate delivery was non_- existant .
neutral	the shipment had to be transferred to a pickup_truck by the shipping company and my son & myself had to unload it by hand .
neutral	they will send you spam .
neutral	they will not honor your requests to stop sending it .
neutral	their " unsubscribe " links do not work .
neutral	update - the freight company said that they cannot do residential liftgate delivery because they cannot get a semi_- truck to residential addresses .
neutral	and i do live in a medium_sized city .
neutral	other trucking companies do not seem to have this problem .
neutral	i could ' nt actually buy anything from this store for about a year .
neutral	i was pretty_much banned for no reason .
neutral	the website has some nifty stuff , so i went and tried again a looong time later and found i can buy stuff now ( yay ).
neutral	would ' nt really rate the service if they suspect you for fraud or whatever , which is good and bad ... ( especially when your not a fraud - _ - ).
neutral	when they like you , the service is great and fast .
neutral	( although took a year to get there , hurrah !)
neutral	overall , i will come_back cause the stocked items are cool .
neutral	cheers
neutral	i love the fact that my roll down window works now but the frame wasnt measured right .
neutral	some of the holes where i was supposed to screw the bolts were off by a centimeter even more .
neutral	i ended_up getting larger bolts to screw them in tge the right way .
neutral	good value - but delivery service was awful and a nightmare to collect from .
neutral	i was very impressed by the low_prices and reasonable shipping at parts_geek .
neutral	part quality was good .
neutral	my concern is response to customer inquiries via_telephone .
neutral	i had questions that i needed to be answered immediately , but could never talk to anyone .
neutral	the hold times were over 00 minuetes , then nothing .
neutral	email response the next_day just does not cut it .
neutral	i '_ve used travelocity for years but i don_'_t like the new format .
neutral	it used to list all the departing flights and allow the user to choose one .
neutral	then it showed the returning flights and the user chose one .
neutral	the format of combined departing / returning flights is much harder to use .
neutral	it was the main_reason i used travelocity rather_than orbitz .
neutral	i haven_'_t found another website yet , but i '_m looking .
neutral	one good thing - the cost of the travel_insurance thru_travelocity .
neutral	don_'_t understand_why you don_'_t ship to hawaii ?
neutral	it cost the same as we are part of the us too !
neutral	it would be a great improvment if you did .
neutral	i ship everything to my son in washington , then have to have him send it to me in hawaii !
neutral	cost much more for me .
neutral	its good prices for solo travelers but when you are in a couple and your money is shared having to basically buy a private room twice is not affordable .
neutral	you can actually normally get nice hotels for less_than a rubbish hostel .
neutral	so why would you bother ???
neutral	it makes no sense .
neutral	i am happy with the products once i actually received them .
neutral	it took 0_weeks just to ship out my belt and buckle and then another 0_weeks for shipping .
neutral	i understand a little delay in the air mail service since they had to ship to the us , but just boxing up a belt should not have taken so long .
neutral	otherwise , i am happy with the quality of their products .
neutral	great experience but product posting , packaging had opportunity to improve .
neutral	items not packed , just thrown_into the box .
neutral	after 00 days rental in venice , no fault of ours , the mirror was broken off while
neutral	parked during the night .
neutral	i was under the impression that the insurance we
neutral	purchased will cover any problem .
neutral	not so , we had a 0 , 000_euros deductible .
neutral	our ccard acct will cover this experience .
neutral	so , plse read and ask questions beforehand , otherwise europcar gives prompt
neutral	service .
neutral	the door_handle is similar to the oem , but not a 0 - to - 0 match in components and fit .
neutral	the door_handle hinge pin is longer_than the oem pin interferes with the mechanical door_handle assembly inside the door .
neutral	i needed to use my 0 " grinder to cut about 0mm off of the hinge pin end so the handle will fit into the door .
neutral	when unpacked it was seen that the base to the vibration plate was damaged --- phoned the company that night who after asking me to send photos on an e_mail said i would be contacted today which has not happened ,,, i await the call
neutral	i wish the order came on time .
neutral	my first order from yesstyle got held back for near a month ...
neutral	i know they ship from china but when they say express shipping i expect it to be fast , oh well , i ordered again for my birthday hopefully it will come faster this time
neutral	i was satisfied .
neutral	i ordered some boots and a couple tops .
neutral	the quality was average , you get what you pay for .
neutral	shipping was high , not really sure why but i still saved money so whatever .
neutral	one of my tops i ordered looked totally different once i received it .
neutral	different color .
neutral	it looks hideous so i was a little upset about that .
neutral	i '_ll either return it or give it to someone at the bottom of my christmas list .
neutral	will_continue to shop with pinkbasis
neutral	blackcircles was the cheapest supplier and the on - line ordering system was faultless .
neutral	confirmation_emails came through quickly - however don_'_t do what i did !
neutral	read the full email because it clearly_stated that fitting could take 00_minutes per_tyre !
neutral	having never had to wait more than 00 - 00_minutes at my usual_supplier to get all 0 changed i did not leave enough time when i pitched up at the chosen fitting_garage .
neutral	it was a ' general ' garage not a dedicated ' fast fit ' tyre and exhaust type outlet .
neutral	consequently they said they would need 0 hours to complete the job despite receiving an appoinment for the fitting .
neutral	had i spotted this in the email at the time of booking i would have cancelled the order .
neutral	despite trying to give blackcircle an earful on the phone for my mistake ( which was another mistake on my part ) they handled mr angry very well .
neutral	00 / 00 for dealing_with an angry customer but fitting times definaytely need improving hence 0_stars - in the end it took 00_minutes .
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	only if fitting times are improved .
neutral	delivery has_been longer_than a week . still_haven_'_t received the part
neutral	delivery time was 0_star .
neutral	all purchases there and even free pen and sweets .
neutral	all good apart_from curtain rail that i purchased
neutral	not good design .
neutral	pity .
neutral	i paid for 0 bottles of mct_oil and 0 mct_oil pills .
neutral	i received one bottle of both the oil and the piles .
neutral	i was shorted one of the bottles of oil .
neutral	my order was shipped in 0 differenent boxes , since all the parts were small they could have fit in one medium box , they all came on 0 different days .
neutral	i was charged for ground_shipping twice since one order came from a different warehouse .
neutral	in all fairness this was the first time i have experienced any problem .
neutral	shipping and service is usually prompt .
neutral	customer service is good at quidco .
neutral	they do try to resolve your issues .
neutral	however , the cashback earned is painfully slow to get paid to you .
neutral	this has put me and friends off from using quidco anymore .
neutral	its just not worth it .
neutral	you always have to chase up your earned cashback .
neutral	would not recommend quidco due to this issue .
neutral	website good , ordered product very smoothly and item was delivered within a few_days , as_described on website .
neutral	my only_criticism was that , being a new customer , there was no ' welcome letter ' or any literature from the company .
neutral	now , this may not bother many people but to me , business should be about building relationships rather_than just feeling like they are taking your money .
neutral	just my opinion , of course .
neutral	because of this , i personally want more from my shopping_experience and hence , probably would not use this site again .
neutral	product as_described and shipped fast .
neutral	one part was new but a bit out of alignment .
neutral	other part was perfect quality .
neutral	phone customer_support is non_- existent and they refer you to website for any concerns .
neutral	je_ne vous conseillerai pas à des copain
neutral	first of all , i never got to actually speak to anyone when the problem started .
neutral	that would be after several emails asking for help were met with return emails promising a response .
neutral	now , it appears that a second set has now shown up .
neutral	go get them !
neutral	!
neutral	i placed my order sunday_evening .
neutral	the product was in - stock , but did not ship until close - of - business tuesday .
neutral	that minor_inconvenience would '_ve been overlooked had it not been for the surprise door tag from fedex_ground saying that the shipper requires in - person signature for delivery .
neutral	i was unable to pick it up at a fedex location , either .
neutral	not without coordinating that with testequipmentdepot first .
neutral	it took me until saturday_afternoon to receive my package , through great frustration .
neutral	the function generator was $_000 , not $_00 , 000 .
neutral	the requirement seems a bit extreme , but should be clearly_stated on the order checkout page as a warning to customers .
neutral	i put my laptop into get repaired last_week .
neutral	there were some really good areas and some not so good .
neutral	good things were the communication , speed of repair and the easy access to the the shop .
neutral	the area i was disappointed in was we paid to get the data transferred off our hard_drive but the data for only one user was moved across .
neutral	this has resulted_in missing photos , music and documents .
neutral	i would also liked to a received the old hard_drive back .
neutral	service was good and would recommend them although disappointed with the above .
neutral	company is very good , customer service is very good , but shipping is very slow , i received my order from wag . com in 0 business days max for free , it took over 0 business days with the pet_flow and i paid_extra for faster shipping .
neutral	i bought a bed mat from partsgeek .
neutral	it was the wrong length for my truck .
neutral	common enough mistake as the length was not in the name , only in the full description .
neutral	i need to write them to get an_rma .
neutral	it takes a few_days .
neutral	when it comes it '_s in a non formatted hard to read email that really isn_'_t too pleasent .
neutral	returns are regular part of on line shopping and need facilitated .
neutral	most places don_'_t even want a phone_call any more .
neutral	rev is not a translation company .
neutral	rev is an electronic platform for clients and translators to post jobs and files .
neutral	their electronic system automatically makes changes ( headers and footers ) to the translators posted document that can not be removed before the final product reaches the client .
neutral	rev does not guarantee that the translation will not contain omissions -- which mine did , along with deletions , and also included headers / footers that were not in the original source document .
neutral	all of these issues were left for me to repair on my end .
neutral	rev '_s project manager actually told me that they have trouble with any project over two - pages long .
neutral	their website '_s staff page does not contain one editor or proofer , rather , it shows several software engineers instead .
neutral	this begs the question : with so many software engineers working for rev , why can '_t their system be any better / useful in this industry ?
neutral	will no_longer do_business with them .
neutral	accused of non_- pay , after spotless record over the years , i ordered one item ; paid w_/ paypal .
neutral	item rec ' d .
neutral	then accused by seller of non_- pay for second item .
neutral	i did not order nor could i use two items , i paid for what i ordered .
neutral	this was second problem with sellers .
neutral	first problem , of non_- supply , decided in my favor .
neutral	they lost customer over false billing of about $ 0 . 00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	still_waiting for the past week and a half for certificate of insurance holder for commercial company haven_'_t heard one word yet from you guys about it not happy
neutral	customer service is non responsive and not helpful , at all !
neutral	the shopping_experience was very easy and i will probably order from them again .
neutral	however , a day after_placing my order i received a partial_refund with no_explanation .
neutral	when my order arrived , it was wonderfully packed ( which was great because it contained glass jars which arrived undamaged ).
neutral	i was disappointed to see that about 00_% of my order was not shipped ( i did receive a refund )...
neutral	it would have been nice if some specific details could have been communicated when it was discovered that some of my items were unavailable because had i known , i would have modified my original order .
neutral	some products ordered were not as expected , build quality poor .
neutral	the slushie maker sounds_like its about to explode !
neutral	!
neutral	facility appears clean so_far , no evidence of rodents or other vermin .
neutral	doors to outside of building are beaten up ... wonder_if a good hard pull will open them .
neutral	the insurance charge is outrageous , as homeowners and rental insurance is extended to cover storage .
neutral	it '_s like that overcharged auto rental insurance .
neutral	i agree with the other reviews - the bait - and - switch with the $ 0 first month rental offset by the hidden_fees is ridiculous .
neutral	as much as i would like to compliment your companies website , i can '_t .
neutral	when i filled_out the information and chose the date for the hotel stay , i then clicked confirm only to notice in the background that your software had changed the reservation date for 00 days in the future .
neutral	i was unable to stop the confirmation process .
neutral	i then tried to phone and because of the time difference was unable to talk to anyone .
neutral	thankfully , i was able to email the problem and was promptly emailed the following_morning with the opportunity to change the res .
neutral	to the original chosen date with a confirmation call and email and an_additional $_00 us .
neutral	thank_you for that , but your website has issues ..
neutral	took way to long to receive my filters 0_weeks .
neutral	the product price was good and ordering was straightforward .
neutral	when received , the goods were exactly as_described and of good quality .
neutral	the process of getting them delivered was a complete pain .
neutral	the website says ' usually 0 days '.
neutral	the call_centre said " oh no , not for palletted items [ so why doesn_'_t the website make this clear ?].
neutral	you will get a call tomorrow to arrange delivery ".
neutral	i didn_'_t .
neutral	called the call_centre at 0 . 00 explaining i was going away - and was told in a very irritated fashion " yodel work till 0 . 00 - you will get a call .".
neutral	i didn_'_t .
neutral	contacted the call_centre after the weekend - got a very helpful person_who sorted it .
neutral	" you will get a text with a 0 hour delivery slot ".
neutral	got text - it was a 0 hour delivery slot .
neutral	" you will get a call from the driver 00 - 00_mins before he arrives ".
neutral	i didn_'_t .
neutral	he called 00_mins before he arrived .
neutral	what a shambles .
neutral	not working preferred entry .
neutral	( fast track )
neutral	dont like the way they ship by ups dropping_off to post_office . taks longer and somtime post_office returns to sender
neutral	jolie hotel prope personel sympatique cable internet c_est vos informasion qui sont eronnee je cherchais pas loin du centre c_est a aumoin 00 kl du centre pour sortire le soir c ela coute 00sfr aller bref meter a jour carte de google
neutral	second day - lots of waiting on the bus while they waited for it to fill at ' bus ' stops .
neutral	bus did not follow its schedule on the second day with no_explanation as to why .
neutral	we gave up and used the subway .
neutral	i love parts_geek website , prices , and fast shipping .
neutral	i have to say that their customer service is not good .
neutral	i purchased two new struts for my montero one of them has a factory defect where the strut connects to the part that bolts on to the vehicle .
neutral	i put the old_ones in the garbage , now parts_geek is asking me to send the bad one back ( which they are out of stock now ) and will eventually send me another one .
neutral	well i use this vehicle everyday for deliveries .
neutral	i am going to take the part to a shop and have the defect fixed it will cost me 00 . 00 .
neutral	so on this order i did not get a good deal at parts_geek .
neutral	no one has ever contacted me about this issue .
neutral	our local comet is a small store and the staff although very enthusiastic are no match for their colleages in the super stor in our nearest city .
neutral	why take the time to tell me that it takes 00_minutes from when you take my money to post my item ........ in your email_saying my product has_been despatched ....... only to take days to deliver it !!!
neutral	!
neutral	talk about shooting yourself in the foot - it made me angry rather_than thinking " thank_goodness it is coming !"
neutral	j
neutral	items as_described and of good value but if like me you are in the trade if you have a problem it needs to be resolved quickly .
neutral	eg item damaged phoned on an 0000 no not sure if this is an uprated call i think it is .
neutral	i disagree with that to start with hanging on for eons before answered .
neutral	ok item dispatched and arrived within 00_hrs only found to be damaged .
neutral	it seems items are distributed around quite a few_times before courier delivers .
neutral	also to check all items in 00_mins is not good i want to keep the products protected while working .
neutral	well i have had my say you choose .
neutral	can '_t say i will not use them again , but care in transportation is lacking !!
neutral	!
neutral	thanks for my order so_far so good .
neutral	the only problem i saw was that it took the part forever to get here more then others .
neutral	thanks
neutral	considering the fujifilm camera i purchased was coming to england from the us , the delivery was fast and efficient - the price was also good .
neutral	the only_negative was being required to contact slrhut to confirm the order and having to wait in their phone system for around 00_minutes before getting through to an cs assistant , that part felt_like they wanted you to contact them just so their staff could try and upsell you various_options which soured what was otherwise an excellent service .
neutral	fantastic looking product but how it got here in one peice i have no_idea the packing was awful plus tried to charge me for delivery even_though it states free next_day which was sent on a 0 day !!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	but like i said good price good product :)
neutral	went to hire desk but was then informed that our vehicle was unsuitable for our_luggage , which contradicted the web booking info , so was forced to upgrade at an extra_cost .
neutral	in addition although all tools were paid by cash during my hire , i am still being billed for tolls !!
neutral	!
neutral	item delivered on time as stated , good communication immediately prior to delivery by e_-_mail and text_message .
neutral	i thought the homepage a little misleading though - i chose this site because it stated 00hr delivery , only to find at the end of transaction , after card details , billing_address , etc given , that 00hr delivery was an extra service incurring additional_charge .
neutral	otherwise no_problems .
neutral	i '_ve been satisfied with pricing and delivery is very quick .
neutral	i '_ve purchased multiple_times and spent a lot .
neutral	i had an issue with one of the items i purchased and inquiries went_unanswered .
neutral	very disappointed with that aspect .
neutral	stand_behind your items .
neutral	the shower system i purchased looks great .
neutral	unfortunately , the diverter valve that switches the flow from the overhead to the handheld unit is either poorly_designed or just doesn_'_t work correctly .
neutral	the water flow to the overhead never shuts_off completely leaving the handheld with weak pressure .
neutral	the first time i called i reached the most unhelpful customer service rep i '_ve encountered .
neutral	she instructed me to disassemble the unit , take a picture of the ' broken ' part and email it .
neutral	the problem with this is : i '_m not a plumber and i don_'_t know what is ' broken ', as compared to poorly_designed .
neutral	i asked to speak with a supervisor repeatedly , but and she never transferred me .
neutral	instead , she finally agreed to ship a replacement part - which turns_out to be the wrong part .
neutral	the second time i called , after waiting on hold for 00_minutes , i was connected to a lovely woman_who quickly agreed to ship a different replacement part .
neutral	unfortunately , that second part is also the wrong one .
neutral	we arrived earlier_than_expected , yet had to wait ( at the service station ) for confirmation from the office that a representative was available .
neutral	on our return the flight was 00_minutes early , we got our_luggage then called , to wait 00_minutes ... the journey to the designated area only took 0 minutes to get to .
neutral	( it happened to be a freezing morning )
neutral	the representatives were very nice and other than their organisation , i will use them next time . plus only 0 further miles on the clock 0 * for that !!
neutral	!
neutral	please check the operating hours of the client service office .
neutral	in case you call the office after hours the pre_- recorded_message doesn_'_t notify you that the office is closed .
neutral	instead dropping the call you are put in a queue .
neutral	i had been in a queue for more than 00 min ( calling long_distance ) before i decided to end the call .
neutral	my wife and i always enjoy the live_commentary bus_tours when visting new cities .
neutral	we hadn_'_t been on one for london so decided to go on one as part of her 00th_birthday experience .
neutral	whlist the bus_tour was very much the same as others i have been on , i notice that there seemed to be a competitor bus_tour company that was running at_least 0 - 0 buses more than this one ( i . e .
neutral	we watched about 0 of the other_companies buses go by before one of this bus_tour companies buses appeared .
neutral	and of course if you prefer live_commentary instead of the recorded one ( which we do ) then you have to wait even longer .
neutral	when we did get on , the commentator was good but the sound system not so good .
neutral	we ended_up having to sit as close to the commentator as possible just to hear what he was saying .
neutral	not normally an issue but this time it was .
neutral	i can right off the bad audio to a faulty mike / speakers but the frequency of the service i found frustrating .
neutral	other that that all good .
neutral	i initially requested a saturday delivery .
neutral	the coming saturday was a bank_holiday_weekend and was advised there was a chance it would be the following weekend .
neutral	this was reasonable .
neutral	i then got a call the following week asking if i was free to accept the delivery that afternoon , i said no as i was in work .
neutral	i said i requested a saturday delivery .
neutral	i then recieved no call or update and the bed was not delivered .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until the following week the delivery slot was booked , with you company not having any record of the previous weeks call .
neutral	the bed was delivered as_promised , but your process isn_'_t great .
neutral	the delivery company only called me on the day of delivery at 0am .
neutral	surely you could arrange a delivery time during the week instead of waking someone up at 0am to advise them their bed will be delivered later on .
neutral	they are pretty reliable but need better coordination with the merchants as some of my orders that were successfully processed ended_up having to become cancelled because i was out of the restaurant '_s delivery zone even_though it said it was within zone online
neutral	nice item and nice price but painfully slooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwww shipping .
neutral	i was pleased to receive the item so quickly ; however , the part i received needed modifications in order to work with my vehicle .
neutral	the gas line ports were the wrong_size and therefor i needed to buy some reducers in order for the part to work .
neutral	i ordered 0 items 0 was not correct but 0 was .
neutral	why do you have a telephone ?
neutral	it is never answered live !
neutral	how do i get a return number ?
neutral	overall i '_m happy with the service .
neutral	it was fast and efficient and the instructions where clear and easy to follow .
neutral	i just don_'_t understand_why you impose a daily_limit .
neutral	this is the only_thing that will make me not want to come_back .
neutral	people pay you get your money and they get the voucher ... why limit the amount the person is spending ?
neutral	sounds_like you want people to keep_coming_back every day or you don_'_t really want their business .
neutral	this is the only reason i '_m giving 0 starts instead of 0 .
neutral	the exit gate failed and was open for a few_days .
neutral	that '_s a problem .
neutral	now it is closed and won_'_t open .
neutral	that '_s an annoyance .
neutral	order was placed on a sunday and got the initial response on monday ... parts did not ship out until thursday ... should have shipped no later than wednesday in my opion ... no_issues with the partas once they were recieved
neutral	when we arrived the service was efficient and professional , however on return we rang at 0 . 00pm and waited in the rain until 0 . 00pm despite_being informed that we would be met in " ten_minutes " and the delay was due to " police checks ".
neutral	so overall not impressed .
neutral	when i purchased my worcester boiler & weather compensate controller , i was really happy as i thought i got a really good price .
neutral	i called to explain that i was coming to the uk from prague to have the items fitted on 00rd / 00th of september , they promised to have both items delivered for the 00rd morning .
neutral	the boiler itself was delivered as_promised and was told by the delivery driver that the controller would come on the tuesday .
neutral	as i needed both items for the monday i drove down to the delivery office for plumb nation only to be told that the controller was out of stock and would have to wait_till the wednesday .
neutral	obviously i was not happy with this due to the fact i had a flight booked to go back to prague wednesday_morning .
neutral	( which plumb nation knew about )
neutral	so i went searching for another controller which i picked_up on tuesday_morning .
neutral	my problem with plumb nation was , why they left it to the last_minute to inform_me they had no stock of the controller and why their delivery driver lied about it coming on the tuesday .
neutral	they ended_up costing me extra money as they controller was more_expensive in the other company .
neutral	the sales_staff are very helpful when discussing things over the phone .
neutral	i ordered two headlight_assemblies and two tail_light_lens for my 0000_gmc sonoma .
neutral	i received the order quickly and was very happy with 0 quarters of it .
neutral	however , the right front headlight_assembly was damaged and i wished to return it for a proper assembly .
neutral	but when i utilized the customer service online " ticket " system i have experienced nothing but problems .
neutral	needing an " rma " number to return the assembly , i have opened 0 tickets since last last saturday where i have explained the situation .
neutral	i have never received the confirmation_email within the 00_minutes i was told it would be sent and i have had no email with a " rma " number that i was told would be sent withing 00 to 00_hours .
neutral	in addition , there is no customer service phone_number to call and advise that i am having problems with the online customer service " ticket " system .
neutral	there is a fax_number , ( i don_'_t have a fax_machine these days ), but i guess i will head down to the ups store and try to reach parts_geek by fax to let them know of my situation .
neutral	these kinks in the online customer service " ticket " system need to be addressed .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	good prices and fast delivery .
neutral	my only_complaint is that you can '_t cancel or change an order without calling or emailing customer service .
neutral	amazon . com has a feature / button where you can cancel or change and order without calling or emailing their customer service .
neutral	that '_s why i '_m giving petflow . com only 0_stars
neutral	self_storage . com gave_us listing of 0 ' x00 ' storage_facilities in our area we choose one and and when we get there they don_'_t have that size available
neutral	i have ordered screws from other_suppliers like mcfeely '_s and they were alwasy delivered in boxes which made storage and retrieval very easy .
neutral	your screws were delivered in plastic_bags so i will have to purchase my own storage containers .
neutral	if screws are high_quality , this won ; t be a major issue because it will be a 0 time cost .
neutral	however , it was a surprise and disappointing .
neutral	the part arrived fast but the box was broken .
neutral	it seemed to me that there was parts missing : the rubber gasket that goes between the mirror and the car body and the nuts to secure them to the car -- both of which i re - used from the broken part .
neutral	in fairness , i am not sure if they were supposed to be included -- but if not , then they should have been .
neutral	otherwise , it was ok .
neutral	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
neutral	i really like goldstar , the events are great as well as the prices .
neutral	i '_m a red_velvet member and love the ease and convenience of easy cancel .
neutral	the only recent thing i dislike about goldstar is the new updated website .
neutral	it more difficult to view the events , i have to scroll thru 00 pages and to click on each event to find out what day the event takes place and what city and venue .
neutral	it is terrible .
neutral	the old format was so much_easier , it showed the event and the date and time and could view around 00 events at one time all on one page .
neutral	.
neutral	in essence the new website makes it more difficult to view and find out about events on goldstar which will eventually affect profits .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	bought a dinner suit , product nice and quality ok , and value good , though the sizing comes up small so had to return the one i ordered for next size up , compared to my normal suit sizing in both trousers and jacket .
neutral	as i then needed it urgently i had to buy and pay for another one before i could return the original one for a swap .
neutral	the second delivery i paid_extra for next_day but it didn_'_t arrive so my wife stayed in all day needlessly , they did refund the cost but that '_s not the point .
neutral	and worse of all i have not yet had the refund on the returned suit which went back over week_ago .
neutral	not sure i would use them again
neutral	i had a good time there .
neutral	and i could improve my english .
neutral	the only bad thing was the wifi which contaminated me around the clock .
neutral	there are at_least 0 wifi transmitter at every floor .
neutral	and the students use the internet with their mobile_phones all the time .
neutral	being there for a longer time might be quite harmful !!
neutral	!
neutral	seems like there wasn_'_t enough mechanics since only 0 bays were being used .
neutral	the waiting area was hot , had to go outside .
neutral	been going there for years , and this was the first time i had wished i had gone somewhere_else .
neutral	and all i had was a flat_tire that i knew about since i had seen the nail when i washed the truck .
neutral	if you ' re gauging when and how often you need to order pet_food , it is very difficult to do so with petflow .
neutral	sometimes , an order can be processed and shipped within a couple of days , landing at your doorstep within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	sometimes , as with my most_recent shipment and others i '_ve placed in the past , it takes them a full 0 days to ship the items out , and another 0 - 0 days after that for the shipment to arrive .
neutral	this last order is supposed to be here tomorrow , which is a full 0_weeks from the order date .
neutral	if you feed a type of food not easily found locally , this can prove to be very problematic .
neutral	the shipping rates and packaging is ok .
neutral	however the item was just left on my porch .
neutral	without_any noticed .
neutral	your would imagine that they would at_least leave a note .
neutral	good price , fast shipment but had to call to see status , no email on shipment .
neutral	despite_being billed as hp compatible , the cartridge purchased caused problems with the printer which , initially , would not accept it as a legitimate product .
neutral	it took a number of goes over a few_days before the printer finally worked .
neutral	bit disappointing really .
neutral	as a first time purchaser from the website , i was a bit unsure of these_guys when i was told that my order was on hold .
neutral	they were out of stock , i had to wait quite a few weeks before actually receiving the goods .
neutral	i think they should state , on the website , which items are out of stock at the time and then give a timeframe for when they expect the stock to arrive .
neutral	they did make it up in as much as they gave_me a few samples and another bottle of what i ' d ordered .
neutral	could of been a better experience ( they could of given me a larger bottle rather_than me having to wait on two bottles ... maybe )
neutral	that said , they were informative ( when asked ) and they do seem quite professional , friendly and approachable .
neutral	if the item is going to be shipped from california and take a week to get to the east_coast please_let the purchaser know that .
neutral	i was assuming the item would be shipped from nj and only take a day or two .
neutral	good value but when you order a set of inks you expect a full set , not one missing and one extra of another .
neutral	have ordered several_times , pretty quick despatch and ink quality good !
neutral	same day payment isn_'_t true because i got mine 0 days late ... other than that its fine :)
neutral	really like the end product .
neutral	quick delivery and arrived as expected .
neutral	but ... didn_'_t expect to have to build the top half !
neutral	this was not clear when we ordered .
neutral	do not expect that with an expensive price of furniture !
neutral	i have an 0000_kia rio cinka that has 00 , 000 moles on it .
neutral	i was sure it would need rear_brake_shoes .
neutral	i ordered new shoes from parts_geek , when they came i pulled the wheels to install the new shoes only to find out the original shoes with 00 , 000_miles of use had more lining left on them than the brand_new shoes , needless to say i did not change them .
neutral	i did however use the front pads that i ordered at the same time i had ordered for the rear .
neutral	the front pads did seem to be of better quality .
neutral	the rear shoes are wagner part # z000 .
neutral	very thin lining would not purchase them again .
neutral	the front pads were ctek and seem to be of better quality .
neutral	i did install them , time and millage will tell if they are good quality .
neutral	twas dank twas dangles twas un belivable
neutral	i recently_purchased a fan_clutch for my 00 toyota .
neutral	i thought it would be an exact_replacement but after taking my fan off and rendering my truck immobile i found that the old fan_clutch had nuts with threaded inserts in the clutch while the new one had only a tapped hole which happened to be larger .
neutral	0mm vs . 0mm .
neutral	i had to call someone to bring me some through bolts which caused me to have to drill out the clutch to accept the through bolts with nuts and locks .
neutral	a little more trouble than i anticipated .
neutral	but delivery was good and part worked after modification .
neutral	i purchased a virtual giftcard that is advertised as instant ( or up to several hours to receive ).
neutral	then i '_m told it '_ll be 0 - 0days " pending review ".
neutral	this is after i purchased one , only to find out that no one reviews / approves them on the weekends .
neutral	so now i have to wait_until monday ?
neutral	in other_words , don_'_t order on a friday_night if you might need it for a birthday in the next 0 - 0 days .
neutral	world class customer service and security ?.... just not on the weekends .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	i just read another review from someone that raised the same issue , and giftcards . com basically denied the existence of their own process when they responded :
neutral	" not sure why anyone would suggest that you would have to " wait_until monday ".
neutral	that is simply inaccurate ."
neutral	in spite of the problems with the porsche vintage parts factory in germany ( fire ).
neutral	i eventually recieved my component after one year .
neutral	i did need to ask for updates every now and again but given the circumstances the service was acceptable , many other_companies would just have given up and returned my order .
neutral	i found my parts cheaper here than anywhere_else , including shipping_charges .
neutral	there was an issue however with my order and stockwise . com required verification from me .
neutral	due to automated_response and no live customer service the process took some time which in turn my items shipped late .
neutral	luckily it got here just in time .
neutral	price is competitive .
neutral	homepage promised to send lenses in 0 - 0 working days , but i '_ve had to wait 00 days , which i found a little annoying .
neutral	delivery was scheduled for day after order put in which company was unable to fulfill resulting in having to take extra time off work and loss of earnings .
neutral	when i ordered the part you said to allow 0 - 0 business days for shipping .
neutral	i was hoping it could be sooner .
neutral	when the parts shipped it stated the parts where leaving from los_angeles , a 0 hour drive from fresno .
neutral	i '_ve had parts shipped to me from l . a . and i '_ve received them as soon as 0 business day at most 0 business days .
neutral	i was able to track my part by computer .
neutral	to my surprise i followed my part to sacramento which is a 0 hour drive from fresno .
neutral	then the part was sent to fresno and delivered to the us_postal_system .
neutral	then the part was delivered to me .
neutral	it took the part a full 0 days .
neutral	i '_m really glad you guys know how to ship parts .
neutral	now i wonder_if i would have gotten my part sooner if i ordered from someone in the midwest ?
neutral	the process was long , which i expected since they said as much on their web_site .
neutral	they got the design right , and the quality of the jersey was pretty_decent - i ' d buy again for sure .
neutral	the quality of the bibs / shorts are pretty poor - i ' d advise against buying them .
neutral	you ' re very fast even when i sent back so that you can correct the mistake .
neutral	you even returned my call back within an_hour .
neutral	but come on you attached someone_else '_s translation initially .
neutral	i hope you didn_'_t attach mine to his .
neutral	you know because of privacy and whatnot .
neutral	besides that the prices are cool
neutral	very nice bed and good delivery communication , but they sent the wrong sizes slats for the bed .
neutral	my husband couldn_'_t be bothered re order so he cut them down himself which took about 00_minutes .
neutral	on the plus side , the room had a microwave and a small frig .
neutral	on the minus siude , the water pressure was very low .
neutral	taking a shower and just washing hands was irritating , and the wireless internet was spotty the entire time .
neutral	00 days from order to packed and shipped is a little over the time frame of 0 - 0 days
neutral	the order process was easy .
neutral	the jacket was delivered within the stated delivery time .
neutral	however , the security tag was still on the jacket !!!
neutral	i had to go to a shop and ask them to remove it safely .
neutral	rather embarrassing !
neutral	i got a pair of boots the material was like cheap cloth and they ripped after 0wears
neutral	an_email from travelocity . com thanks me for my recent_purchase and asks me to fill_out a rating for them .
neutral	i have not made a recent_purchase on travelocity . com , so the only_thing i have to go on is this email .
neutral	my review / rating ?
neutral	travelocity . com is confused .
neutral	the cost of the product was more overall than my high_street provider but the ourchase was more convenient .
neutral	i haven_'_t bothered to install the part yet , because it arrived too_late for me to install before i drove nearly a thousand_miles last weekend .
neutral	0 " business days " for shipping seemed ridiculous . i figured ordering saturday that i should receive by the end of following week or i would have taken the $_00 - 00 rush shipping charge , or better yet , cancelled order and drove 00_minutes to auto_zone and paid their price .
neutral	bought 000 l - carnitine 000 .
neutral	note 000 capsules and they sent me a bottle with a april_0000 expiration_date .
neutral	bad quality control , have to sent it back .
neutral	received bottle on feb . 00th .
neutral	normally when i buy vitamins on the internet i get at_least a 0000 expiration_date .
neutral	guess they think i would not look at date .......... otherwise happy with other products i have bought through pure_formulas .
neutral	i no_longer use towequipe as the courier they use is terrible !
neutral	they lied by saying they had been when they had not .
neutral	communication with towequipe was great but the couriers claimed they had left a card when they had not even tured up , ( cctv ).
neutral	on the third day of waiting we were told it was on the van then at 0 . 00_pm it suddenly popped_up as " called , noone in ".
neutral	sad but a company is as strong as its weakest link .
neutral	in this case yodel !
neutral	got my package quickly but very disappointed that the box marked fragile was torn and mashed .
neutral	parts_geek must have a lot of trouble with bad packages because of the directions they give in their email shipment notification if you receive a damaged package .
neutral	great experience until we returned the car .
neutral	suddenly mystery charges started to appear on my credit_card even_though we paid upfront and filled up the tank to the top .
neutral	it is easy to search and order parts and they come quickly and well_packaged .
neutral	and they can be inexpensive , so that '_s all good .
neutral	three_times in 0 years , i ordered the correct part , received the wrong part and i have had to pay return shipping .
neutral	last time , i called on the phone to verify that i was ordering the correct part and had the wrong part delivered ( asked for the left , received the right ) and was still responsible for return shipping .
neutral	i now hesitate to purchase large parts , bc the cost of return shipping can be as much as the part cost in the first place .
neutral	i still use partsgeek to order small parts , however .
neutral	i believe that when i make an honest mistake , that the burden to fix it is mine .
neutral	always use skypark , but disappointed this time to find cancellations cover , booking and sms confirmation fees had been added without my realising !
neutral	this added nearly 00_% to the cost , negating any supposed discount !
neutral	took several days before they shipped and the email_notification went astray ( maybe not their prob ).
neutral	item was correct
neutral	bought upstream and downstream oxygen_sensors from you , as i do for many other vehicles our company owns privately and other wise .
neutral	the ots scanner said the new part was defective , thought it was referring to something else because reading didn_'_t change from old to new .
neutral	scanners are not straight_forward .
neutral	i was past the 00 day time frame .
neutral	check my past , a new one is on its way to me from you now .
neutral	i buy a lot of parts , much from you .
neutral	i will be looking for a second vender for the internet purchases to put in first priority .

neutral	vp winelegan corp .
neutral	emailed company telling that 0 mirror had a deep scatch through plasticcover .
neutral	i emailed company telling of it , i order 0 mirrors the same and i told them one was ok !
neutral	they sent an_email to return the order not as i said !
neutral	i emailed them again about this , they would respond , i don_'_t know when ?
neutral	thank_you again for providing a various number of hotel choices .
neutral	i was able to look at different hotels and i was satisfied with my decision .
neutral	de levertijd was lang bestelling maar verkeerd adres gestuurd , ik weet nog_niet of ik daar nog wel weer bestel .
neutral	please tell me the conversion rate of euros to dollars .
neutral	my booking of a hotel in washington was priced in euros with no assistance to conversion to dollars .
neutral	when you get this please assist me as soon as possible .
neutral	thanks paul
neutral	i ordered bathroom furniture and 0 piece was out of stock .
neutral	we waited patiently for over 0_weeks and then had to phone the company re delivery .
neutral	they wanted us to pay extra to have the items delivered asap , which we declined .
neutral	eventually they agreed to cover this extra_cost , after numerous calls .
neutral	when the furniture arrived , 0 item was very difficult to fit and after several phone_calls for advice , we gave up and my husband had to re - make the unit so it fitted .
neutral	i purchased a alpinestars atem suit and had trouble with the hip inserts .
neutral	the first person i spoke with told me the suit was too big for me and really didn_'_t listen to my problem or try to help .
neutral	i called back and spoke to a different person and they went and looked at the suit and helped determine that the inserts are installed incorrectly from the makers .
neutral	they go in horizontally instead of vertically , that way up is up and forward .
neutral	made sense after he helped_me .
neutral	the hop - on , hop - off concept is a great way to see london , get oriented , spend more time where you like .
neutral	the maps and routes were easy to understand .
neutral	buses came reasonably frequently ( except at the end of the day ), and the audio tours were also helpful ( although the channel marked with the chinese flag gave japanese language ).
neutral	customer service was somewhat lackluster -- i ' d say half of the attendants at the stops didn_'_t seem interested in making conversation , and the one live tour_guide gave rather sporadic commentary ( it was at the end of the day ).
neutral	one thing to watch out for -- the tickets are good for 00_hours , but you have to pay_attention to the last bus at night and when they start in the morning .
neutral	we ended_up missing the last bus that would go to paddington and had to walk a bit through hyde_park ( pleasant , still light out , but surprised that the buses stopped ).
neutral	it was a good way to see the sights of london , but better customer service would have made it a warmer experience
neutral	i was disappointed an frustrated with the agent , trying to find a 0 bedroom suite as i am travelling with my daughter .
neutral	the agent was not interested in finding one only in getting me booked .
neutral	i almost hung_up when she rudely told me i was not on hotels . com but get - a - room .
neutral	i just wanted to get the room and be done with her .
neutral	we it was like chinese torture trying to get all my parts .
neutral	most of my order was complete in 0 days but it came in three shipments .
neutral	these were very small parts , all of which could have fit in one box .
neutral	the packing_list for the original ship showed all the parts in the box but no backordered parts leaving me to wonder_if the balance of the order was to follow .
neutral	i contacted partsgeek on their customer service page and they promised to get back with me within 00 - 00_hours which they did .
neutral	after sending that message though the 0nd shipment arrived with no paperwork but with one part missing .
neutral	when i contacted them about that they said they would reship my part indicating that it had been shipped .
neutral	by saying they would reship it i took that to mean they thought they had shipped it and it had either been lost or i was trying to get a free part .
neutral	anyway , after an exchange of the 00 - 00 messages they said they would reship my part .
neutral	poor way to communicate , slow and confusing .
neutral	oh well , i guess they '_ve now shipped my last part so i '_m ok now but it would be nice if they had a phone_number you could call with issues .
neutral	it would avoid the ponderous process of back and forth messages .
neutral	stedet i sig self har_ikke ændret sig så_meget igennem årene .
neutral	men_det_har teknologien til gengæld .
neutral	der mangler en app for os med smartphone '_s ( og_det må efterhånden være mange !)
neutral	den mobil site som boyfriend har er temlig outdated og_jeg bruger den aldrig .
neutral	jeg_er_ikke typen der logger på bf . dk via computer så ofte , ja faktisk venter jeg som_regel til jeg_får den berømte e_-_mail om at min profil vil blive slettede hvis_jeg_ikke logger ind .
neutral	men havde_jeg en app på_min iphone ville det_ikke være et problem for mig at være på hver dag .

neutral	since there are many mac users , i am surprised that the software , such as privacyprotect , is only available in a windows version .
neutral	useless for mac users .
neutral	also , i sent a message through the identityguard concerning this issue and never received a reply .
neutral	i f you can help me in order to get my refound back .
neutral	they charge 000 on arrive ( inclued prep paid fuel 00 . 00 )
neutral	i was waiting for 000 for refound as metion on the bill but finally they refoun only 000 , usd
neutral	the total for the rent was 000 dolars + 00 uds for your services , total 000 the duble expect .
neutral	total 000 dolars
neutral	i have used a phillips centrifugal for a couple of years and i wanted to upgrade .
neutral	having thoroughly researched , i decided to buy a ' top of the range " hurom slow juicer hf - sbf00 .
neutral	the good things were fast delivery , nice looking machine , quiet working and excellent juice .
neutral	the problem areas include half production speed of the philips juicer , blocks very easily with fibre e . g .
neutral	celery , i understood from the hurom promo videos produces smoothies using the course sieve but was told by the uk juice that this is not the case and i need to use a blender , the documentation is very limited with hardly any information as to how to use the machine .
neutral	this partially led to an accident .
neutral	on my very first juice , i was cleaning the hopper with a kitchen towel which accidently fell_into the mechanism breaking both the auger and sieve .
neutral	it cost me around £_00 to replace - this is full price whereas a concessionary price would have been much_appreciated under the circumstances , a complementary juicing book did not arrive - i am still_waiting for it , perhaps my expectations were too high but when one pays for “ first_class ” it ’_s always disappointing if things do not go as expected .
neutral	ordered from petflow six days ago and in this world of quick delivery , i '_m surprised it will take a full 0 days to get from new_jersey to ohio .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	the sales_rep that assisted_me gave_me no product detail so that cost me hundreds extra in additional equipment .
neutral	he also gave_me a grossly incorrect shipping time frame .
neutral	when i called to speak to get the situation corrected the delays were blamed on me because " i should have been informed of the product i wanted to purchase ".
neutral	i eventually got what i needed but it took me weeks in delays and hundreds in additional_costs .
neutral	i was very disappointed compared to my prior experiences with this company .
neutral	while i '_m happy with the product now , i don_'_t know if i would purchase with them in the future .
neutral	i ended_up not saving any money , there were long delays , and in the end i found better local deals that i could have done better with after it was all said and done .
neutral	why do you really need a mobile number ?
neutral	i don_'_t use mine too often and had to go looking for it .
neutral	also - where are the directions to the car_park that used to come up automatically when you booked ?
neutral	really could do with some after sales service as cannot get the till to work properly .
neutral	thanks
neutral	they have lots of great sales on treats , and i also have an auto ship for my dog '_s blue wilderness formula .
neutral	free shipping !
neutral	can '_t beat these_guys for deals .
neutral	the price for the book i purchased was great , as was the free shipping but it was frustrating that when i discovered before my order even shipped , that the ship - to address was incomplete and had important information omitted , there was no way to update / correct the ship - to address .
neutral	after_contacting customer service multiple_times and being told that ' there was nothing ' that could be done , i gave up and crossed my fingers .
neutral	the book finally did arrive - but a week late .
neutral	it seems absurd to me , and bad business , when a customer is told that there is nothing that can be done to resolve an issue with an order - before it even ships !
neutral	i received my order , and it was wrong .
neutral	partsgeek did send the part missing , but never notified me that they had sent it .
neutral	i had to ask again for them to send it before they sent me the notification that it was at my receiving area .
neutral	it cost me a week or two of waiting for my part .
neutral	i ordered a direct fit catalytic_converter for a toyota_prius that is shown as a one piece in the listing , just like the original , and nowhere in the listing does it mention that what will be shipped is broken down into multiple , smaller pieces for cheaper shipping .
neutral	the original is about a 0 foot long pipe with two catalytic_converters and resonator , with flanges on both_ends and rubber grommet hangers in the middle so that it is very easy to line - up properly since everything is one piece .
neutral	when this arrived it was three_separate pieces , which makes it much more difficult to install for one person .
neutral	you only have two hands .
neutral	the included items were one pipe clamp and one doughnut gasket .
neutral	three pieces of pipe would require two clamps and the system requires a doughnut gasket on both_ends , so it was missing one clamp and one gasket .
neutral	i had to make a trip to the parts store to find another clamp , and i had to reuse the old doughnut gaskets since the gasket that was included was the wrong_size and i could not find them in stock in any parts stores .
neutral	the gaskets would have been about $_00 each if i had ordered them , and several days delivery .
neutral	the parts were very poorly_packaged .
neutral	the box was only held closed by two pieces of tape .
neutral	the copper staples were ripped out and the box was flapping open , so possibly the missing clamp and doughnut gasket simply fell out during shipping .
neutral	all of that being said , when i finally got it installed , it lined_up as it needed to and seems to be working as it should .
neutral	much , much_lower price overall than ordering one direct from toyota , and this price difference makes all of the headache of install worth it .
neutral	i needed brake_pads for my mini .
neutral	the site said they were in stock so i ordered them along with rotors .
neutral	the rotors shipped right_away but two_days_later i get a refund for the brake_pads because they are out of stock .
neutral	i rechecked the site and it shows they are in stock .
neutral	now i need to order them elsewhere and wait again .
neutral	what a pain in the a $$.
neutral	the communication was good , the delivery was timely and the overall experience wasn_'_t bad .
neutral	the one thing i would say was that the shipping box was to flimsy for the size and weight of the parts ordered .
neutral	upon unwrapping the new " premium " grill from the packaging the lower mounting_bracket was broken at both_ends .
neutral	fortunately i was able to reuse the original grill '_s bracket .
neutral	the delivery was quick but the packing was done poorly and broke .
neutral	now they say it 00 - 00 hour to get back to me and they did .
neutral	but it was only to notify me that they got my message and now it another 00 - 00_hrs to get back to me again .
neutral	hmmm it '_s still not here !
neutral	part was delivered in the expected time , that '_s good .
neutral	part delivered was the part ordered , that '_s also good .
neutral	part worked , that '_s good .
neutral	however , the part arrived in terrible condition !!
neutral	someone simply threw it in a box and shipped it ... no protective paper , and the box wasn_'_t even taped .
neutral	the box arrived torn and opened .
neutral	the part was scratched and the plastic was cracked .
neutral	i superglued the crack , then painted the part to match the color of my car , which i had to do anyway .
neutral	at_least the part ( powered side_view_mirror ) was placed in a cloth - like satchel .
neutral	the price was good , and i would probably use partsgeek . com again .
neutral	i rate the part as good , but the delivery as below_average .
neutral	dan
neutral	heathrow to london trip was great - our flight was late , and our driver was waiting .
neutral	that is reassuring to see and not have to wait .
neutral	london to heathrow was not great - the driver waited much too_long for the other passenger who was not ready .
neutral	we were concerned_about getting to the airport on time .
neutral	this is despite the published rules about how long they will wait for pick ups !
neutral	that is not a good feeling - fuels anxiety !
neutral	next trip we will look for other choices for transfer rides !
neutral	they automatically renew my insurance when i did not know that i had signed_up to it
neutral	i actually had to " wait in line " ( in que ) to purchase products from their site .
neutral	seems they would have the technology down for a comany this large .
neutral	products purchsed were very good , and dilevery time was a bit long .
neutral	i would purchase from target online again unless there was an_alternative website with a better reputation and the same product .
neutral	i found the prices very reasonable , but it took almost two_weeks to get my parts .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it was fedex or partsgeek , but it was a hang_up nonetheless .
neutral	i will use them again and see if the delivery improves .
neutral	the parts were correct and they came in name_brand boxes .
neutral	ordered control_arms that had grease fitting , got control_arms that can '_t be greased they are for same vehical and will probably fit .
neutral	vehical can '_t be down any longer so can ; t return for what i ordered this is my 0st order from you , from 0 - 00 you guys are 0 right now thanks paul
neutral	i recently rented a car from interrent ( through autoeurope ) at_gatwick airport , uk .
neutral	the first problem i encountered was that interrent are located about 00_minutes away from the airport .
neutral	big problem for me was that there are no courtesy phones at_gatwick airport and i did not have a cell_phone or any change for a payphone to call for the interrent courtesy bus .
neutral	in the end i went into the hertz office and asked them to call for me .
neutral	interrent is a very tiny operation and only have 0 cars at their location .
neutral	apparently if they need any more cars they borrow them from europcar ..
neutral	the car i had was good , clean , new and economical .
neutral	i had no_complaints about the car , a toyota yaris hybred .
neutral	on returning my car the office was supposed to open for me at 0 . 00 am but no one arrived until 0 . 00am . the man who opened up said no one had told_him to come in early for me ..
neutral	all in all i do not particularly like small rental_companies and especially ones located away from the airport .
neutral	which doesn_'_t have a courtesy phone service .
neutral	i don_'_t know why autoeurope booked me with interrent .
neutral	next time i will make_sure i get hertz or avis
neutral	paid for text alerts pick_up and delivery , both which i did not receive .
neutral	luckily i was at home when driver came for pick_up
neutral	on two occasions i have ordered products and paid_extra for one day or two day shipping .
neutral	on both_occasions the products did not arrive on the " recieive item by " date .
neutral	when i contacted amazon they told me that they would ship new orders by next_day air but didn_'_t refund the extra money i paid .
neutral	i have flown on delta dozens of times and have been_disappointed recently .
neutral	specifically , i took a flight where i had to make a connection and we were stuck because of the weather .
neutral	the individuals tasked with providing information and assistance hated their jobs and made their frustration very clear .
neutral	i saw them speaking to customers in an antagonistic and confrontational manner .
neutral	i was not even offered assistance or information without escalating the issue to a manager .
neutral	very easy understandable no_hidden cost or fees , good business acceptability for customers .
neutral	i ordered a radiator because mine was leaking and causing my car to overheat .
neutral	it took 0 week before i received notice that it will ship and 0_weeks to arrive , not good .
neutral	i tried_contacting customer_support with no luck , i spent almost 0 hours trough out the day trying to make contact i was on hold but that was the best i can do .
neutral	overall the product arrived in good condition , it worked great and the price was unbeatable .
neutral	if the shipping and customer_support were improved this company would be the best place to go .
neutral	hey_buddy , you will have to ensure this company gives you a good product .
neutral	the product i ordered was rather shoddy and had multiple misspellings within the document .
neutral	this is a translation company that has problems spelling and checking their own work .
neutral	price was higher_than local_petsmart so you ' re paying for the " free " shipping .
neutral	i purchased 0 bags of wild buffalo salmon 00_lb .
neutral	bags of cat_food and the sell by date was 0 months closer than those from petsmart .
neutral	also , i had to subscribe to get $_00 off the order and when i didn_'_t complete checkout i received an_email with a lifetime free shipping offer and a code to enter for it .
neutral	however , that code gave_me free shipping but took away my $_00 off coupon .
neutral	i will likely not continue with this company because i am disappointed with the dates , they have scheduled my next four shipments and without_any discounts it '_s just not worth it to pay more .
neutral	also , a local farm store has started carrying it and i get 00_%_off every tuesday and at about $_00 per bag that '_s better_than the $_00 off i got here .
neutral	price fine part fit fine finish not goodchrome has bad place in plan sight
neutral	i ordered 0 cd '_s on 0 / 00 and you sent them out on 0 / 00 and i received them on 0 / 00 .
neutral	they were sent by fedx .... wagon train could have gotten them here faster i live only 000 mile from where you sent them out ... i would look for a faster mode of transport if i were you .
neutral	goods dispatched quickly , but courier service was bad .
neutral	they were supposed to deliver on a friday , nothing came , no card , no goods .
neutral	first time iflorist user here , but i had the same concern as fellow user jason who said , " will update my score and comments on the 00th of feb
neutral	i have placed an order for delivery on the 00th of feb for the mixed roses , they should be delivered to my place of work so i will post back here on the quality and arrival_date , from what i have been reading most of the deliveries make it on the right date but im worried as mine state '_s delivery will be the " week commencing the 00th of feb " and not " will be delivered on the 00th_feb " which is what i requested .... i guess time will tell on this one "
neutral	i also requested that my flowers arrive on the day of feb_00th , but it shows up as " week commencing the 00th of feb " as well .
neutral	i chose free shipping , but prior to purchasing i talked to the online customer service in chat and they told me that if i selected the 00th that it will arrive on the 00th , which led to my purchase .
neutral	i took a screenshot of the conversation as well .
neutral	i will be thoroughly disappointed if my flowers don_'_t arrive on that date and will update my review after valentine '_s day ...
neutral	i really like the tpc ( total_primate care ) vitamin_packs , but half the time i go to order them , they are out of stock .
neutral	signed_up for an_email alert for when they came back which i didn_'_t receive .
neutral	signed on during the time i was waiting for the email and discovered they were in stock - ordered 00 day supply .
neutral	next time i went to buy they were out again , signed_up for alert email and got it , only to find they were out of stock again when i logged in .
neutral	these are now out of stock more than they are in and i '_m done .
neutral	wished the agent knew the hotel better - a little vague on some things .
neutral	it had been a long time since my last order .
neutral	i had a bad_experience and was leery of ordering again .
neutral	but i did and you let_me down again .
neutral	my order was incomplete and there was a toner_cartridge in my box instead of what i ordered .
neutral	i sent the cartridge back but have still not received my missing component .
neutral	i guess it '_s a bad day to send me a survey .
neutral	fast delivery , good price however recieved the ' older ' version of racing ralph 00er snakeskin when the picture shows the new version .
neutral	:-(
neutral	i love , absolutely love , onnit products .
neutral	i have used alpha_brain ( the old and new formulas ) shroom_tech sport , new_mood , t +, and mct_oil ; and i have experienced positive_results from all of them .
neutral	i have also tried out the total_primate care package which gave_me positive_results , but not as positive as buying the products individually and using the recommended dosage .
neutral	after doing some comparison_shopping on amazon , i have stopped ordering from onnit .
neutral	i can buy similar products that have the same , if not better , effects at a drastically reduced price .
neutral	i like what you guys put out , but i am no_longer willing to pay for it .
neutral	drop the price down to a fair market value and i will return as a customer .
neutral	purchased an electric compressor .
neutral	right price , nice machine , delivered on time .
neutral	i then opened the box and found that the air_filter and plastic casing were cracked .
neutral	i rang the support department , who said to send a photograph of the damaged parts .
neutral	i did this straight_away .
neutral	to date i have had no reply or parts .
neutral	i have had to gaffa tape the air_filter together to enable me to use it .
neutral	not ideal .
neutral	the machine works_fine .
neutral	my only other comment is that there are no quick connectors included with the compressor .
neutral	this means you need to add about £_00 to the purchhase price to cover this .
neutral	because i use ludwig hardware this is one of the few places i can go . due to lack of places to buy ludwig particularly in stock i order here through necessity . prices aren_'_t that good but that '_s due to lack of competition on ludwig , but the absolute worst part about the wembley drum centre is the ludicrous shipping cost £ 0 . 00 on a £_00 odd order . made worse by the fact i forgot something and had to pay the same shipping again the next_day .
neutral	rep appeared unfamiliar with room accomodations and discounted_rate for wedding relatives .
neutral	booking room involved payment in full in advance without_any advance cancellation_notice offered .
neutral	when building the ad i wanted to save my work and come_back later .
neutral	the first time i tried it failed to save it .
neutral	second time , after i reentered my data and selected photos i was too invested to worry so i placed a call to your support people .
neutral	learned my changes would be saved .
neutral	you should make it more explicit whether changes will be saved without agreeing that the ad can / will be placed at that moment .
neutral	try it , you '_ll find where i wondered_if i could save my work and come_back later and review it before i let the ad go live .
neutral	i '_ve used pc_games supply for a year now and 00_% of the time i '_ve had a really pleasant_experience with them .
neutral	the one time i had to contact their customer service department i had an appaling time , took ages to get the problem sorted !
neutral	on the plus side , delivery is quick and easy .
neutral	all good except part mounted diff from original .
neutral	probably sent wrong year or part # .
neutral	anyway , modified it to work !
neutral	it was an electric_window assembly .
neutral	you guys have great service and good prices ..... but every time i want to order a standard process item it says ...." out of stock ".
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	the prices of products are the best i have found on the internet .
neutral	the placement of the my order response was very fast .
neutral	however things went_downhill from there .
neutral	there was no notification of how or when the order was to be shipped .
neutral	ten days after_placing the order i sent an e_-_mail and a telephone message ( a recording could not speak to a real_person ) requesting shipping information .
neutral	i received an e_-_mail the next_day saying ,( shipping soon , please wait ).
neutral	i sent a second e_-_mail two_days_later requesting shipping information .
neutral	the same day a few hours_later i received an e_-_mail giving me the tracking_information and expected delivery date .
neutral	fourteen days after ordering i received the order well_packed and as_described in the order .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the returned phone_call .
neutral	the short of this is that if hombz would send shipping information as soon as available to the customer it would give all of us a warm feeling that we were really going to get what we ordered in a timely_manor .
neutral	i understand when you use ground_shipping of any kind it will take longer but please_let us know when .
neutral	the end results were excellent , but the middle of the process stinks .
neutral	really pleased with the online experience and the delivery time .
neutral	however , this company let themselves down on the call_centre / customer service side .
neutral	i had a problem with the item i ordered and in trying to resolve the issue , i received a fairly abrute response and was told that i was in the wrong ( which was genuinely not the case ).
neutral	i would use the firm again as the price point is excellent but if you value customer care and support then you may want to look at other options .
neutral	note - don_'_t expect to get through to this company on the phone quickly .
neutral	i also had to ring them to check when the item was going to be delivered ( no text messaging , email or call confirmation was sent 00hours before , which is a standard approach for most retailers ).
neutral	i wish we had a promo_code or coupons periodically sent via_email .
neutral	the ' price match ' wasn_'_t exactly as they insisted on factoring in the price of mounting .
neutral	i also didn_'_t get the ' internet package ' price on the balancing but i didn_'_t scrutinize the invoice .
neutral	i still saved $_000 over invoice for the tires .
neutral	next time i '_m going to just use the online process rather_than try to accelerate the process by calling the store directly .
neutral	prices are about the same as anywhere_else but they price match and take 0 percent off if they are not
neutral	i ordered 00 leashes , i the received an_email_stating 00 were not available , the another email days_later that another 0 weren_'_t available .
neutral	so all be told , i received 0 of what i wanted .
neutral	smaller sites have better inventory control .
neutral	after_reading the reviews here about being cut_off multiple_times , i thought it was just a few people with bad_experiences .
neutral	i screwed_up on my ticket , my bad .
neutral	after calling at_least five times and explaining the situation and being cut_off each time i was put on hold or transferred , i got that sinking feeling things were gonna get worse .
neutral	i finally talked to a wonderful lady name ana who actually stayed on the phone the whole time , recommended a refund with the penalty and just re - book a cheaper flight because the dates i wanted were not available anymore .
neutral	i agreed , took the loss .
neutral	i '_ll cry about it another day .
neutral	reviews on refunds were not any better , so i had my doubts .
neutral	but a week_later the money was back in my account just like ana said it would be .
neutral	relieved !.
neutral	if it weren_'_t for all the disconnections i would '_ve gave a better review .
neutral	there is a definite need for improvement at flighthub customer service .
neutral	that said , thank_you ana .
neutral	you saved my butt .
neutral	as detailed above , we are still_waiting for resolution of the problem of the unsatisfactory markings on the sideboard , a rep from oak_furniture visited today and took photos , waiting for the feedback .
neutral	our rating is dependant upon satisfactory resoluution of our complaint .
neutral	the products seem to be top quality but do not order online call them or you will waste a lot of time trying to buy their products .
neutral	bought test order to use in our magimix nespresso_machine .
neutral	excellent , quick delivery time and tried pods in the machine .
neutral	there was greater resistance to the loading lever when installing , so despite the fact that the coffee flavour was excellent , we decided we did not want to risk damaging the machine .
neutral	we contacted the fine_coffee_club who accepted or request for return .
neutral	i was very impressed with this understanding and level of service .
neutral	i ordered a product containing 0 black and 0 color refilled_cartridges for my hp officejet g00 printer .
neutral	the first black_cartridge did not work at all the color cart and the second blackcart worked after cleaning the contacts and running setup pages several_times .
neutral	let '_s see how long they perform .
neutral	i ordered a shirt on sunday the 00th selecting the dhl 0 - 0 day priority_mail .
neutral	spent the whole day monday being picked , packed but not shipped .
neutral	checked again tuesday_morning which said it shipped on the monday but there was no email_notification of this and also no tracking_number provided in the order details .
neutral	emailed and posted a message on the facebook_page to get a tracking_number but no response .
neutral	i would just like confirmation of shipment and a tracking_number so i no when it will arrive .
neutral	order number 00000000
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	shipment was one day late .
neutral	packaging was unsound structurally .
neutral	partsgeek has a wide_selection of parts for most vehicles and the orders usually arrive pretty quickly .
neutral	ordering online is fairly easy ( if you already know what you ' re looking for ) and painless .
neutral	you do , however , need to make_sure you get your order right .
neutral	if there are any_problems or questions , getting a hold of customer service can be a nightmare .
neutral	i currently have a project stopped half way ( and the car is not usable right now ) because of mislabeled parts .
neutral	repeated calls just tell me to file a support_ticket online , so looks_like that car will be laid up a few more days while i wait for an_email back instead of being_able to talk to somebody on the phone .
neutral	lots to choose from and good pricing .
neutral	however , same can be said for other online_retailers .
neutral	after buying from these_guys for nearly two years they finally talked me into starting an autoship_program .
neutral	well they screwed that up within a week .
neutral	they sent the scheduled order two_weeks in advance and of course charged me at the time of shipment .
neutral	i called and notified them and they arranged for pickup .
neutral	i was already not happy and decided to cancel the program with the intent of still shopping with them .
neutral	they lost me as a customer when they left me hanging on the refund .
neutral	i had to contact them again to get that figured_out .
neutral	they do not provide any sort of email_confirmation or tracking on any of the above .
neutral	they are unprofessional in this regard .
neutral	as a foreigner , i found myself confused at times !
neutral	i was uncertain if i would get an e_- ticket or have to get a ticket at the port .
neutral	i had no way of knowing how long i should allow between the ferry terminal in calais and catching a train in calais .
neutral	finally , i wasn_'_t sure if i need to get a seat in the lounge or not and if i didn_'_t reserve a seat if i would have to stand for the 0 0 / 0 hour crossing from dover to calais .
neutral	i know somethings aren_'_t your fault , but recently a i received i damaged package , you guys know that the products you send to brazil travels a lot , so you should protect it better .
neutral	everything is going online .
neutral	no one wants to download your software to print their labels .
neutral	other_websites such as ebay have an online interface to choose from .
neutral	you should hire some php developers and make an online interface so that people can print their labels even quicker without having to worry_about hard_drive space , download , etc .
neutral	my review is good as far as convenice i called and got my order shipped but the only problem i had was that the lady on the phone told me that my order would be at my house no later then two_days i didn_'_t get my order until 0 days_later so if u guys at pet_flow could fix that i would rate u hire as of right now i '_ll rate it at 0 . 0 change that and it will be a 0 oh and there '_s no way to track ur order because pet_flow doesn_'_t tell u who they used to ship it
neutral	had most of what i needed but not all .
neutral	i waited to see if it would be available later but it was never restocked .
neutral	ordering was easy but shipping wasn_'_t as easy .
neutral	all 0 items were picked_up the same day at the same time , 0 of the 0 made it on time but were not delivered by fed_ex as stated , they handed it off to the post_office who delayed it another day .
neutral	finally the 0rd item was delivered several days_later by fed_ex ... had to wait several days to get all parts so i can fix my vehicle ... not very reliable as far as shipping .
neutral	i ordered 0 or 0 parts , all supposedly in stock , one was not , took several days of shipping notices from each facility before i new for sure there was a problem , sure_enough , no stock , first response from customer service was completely off as it referred to a part i did not even order , second response was sorry , not in stock , canceling the line .
neutral	what i did get was fine although the packaging from the various shippers was terrible .
neutral	also got credited for $ 0 less_than was originally charged for the item not in stock , go figure .
neutral	prices were ok , may or may not buy from them again .
neutral	quote was $_00 a month .
neutral	first payment ended_up being $_00 .
neutral	use the price as a general guideline , not as reality .
neutral	0 days ago you say my part was shipped well it has not arrived .
neutral	why ?
neutral	parts were delivered on time , they are more_expensive due to shipping_costs .
neutral	if you have 0 items the may each be delivered from a different warehouse and each warehouse charges separate for shipping .
neutral	don_'_t think i will use them in the future .
neutral	prices were great part search easy shipping was fast .... the only_thing negative about parts_geek is they dont answer the phone i called and there computer puts you on hold with music and thats that they never answer the phone i put the phone on speaker and it play music for 0 0 / 0 lol thats wrong pissing me off then you try to reply to them useing the request form online and they never reply back to that either ... so if you need to return something from this company i think you might have problems ,, cause they give you 00 days n say you need a certain form before returning part so if they never answer phone n never reply to there online form then how will you return anything .... thats what im worried_about
neutral	i received the ink_cartridge broken and a lot of the ink spilled in the box .
neutral	the experience was good overall , price and the timing of getting the product .
neutral	i was disappointed in the size of the lettering , way to small and there is plenty of more room on the pen .
neutral	this would of made it stand out so much more .
neutral	i would recommend , and only ask if this could be corrected in the future orders .
neutral	i ordered a part online that i had to return because it was the wrong part .
neutral	i had no_problems in getting a return_authorization_number , my only_complaint is that i wanted to reorder the correct part and it is impossible to speak to a live rep .
neutral	i even had a sales_rep named " ricky " leave a number to contact him at a certain time .
neutral	let '_s just say that i have been trying for the past 0 days to get in touch with " ricky ".
neutral	all the phone does is ring and ring , it doesn_'_t even go to a voicemail .
neutral	i did have the pleasure of someone picking_up the other and ask " can you hear me ?"
neutral	and when i said hello they hung the phone up in my ear .
neutral	great on parts but talking to a live customer service rep is horrible .
neutral	i sold a laptop for $_000 and ebay charged me over $_00 just because it sold .
neutral	that '_s bullshit .
neutral	every time i have money deposited_into my account , paypal takes too much of a cut .
neutral	it '_s a bit outrageous .
neutral	takes too_long to deposit funds from my bank_account and vice_versa .
neutral	the only good thing is that the money does get transferred and i have a paypal master card .
neutral	that '_s nice because i '_ve run_into a time or two when visa wasn_'_t accepted .
neutral	but you can '_t use atms unless money is in account , regardless of the account that it '_s linked to .
neutral	plus that , bill me later is a great idea , but it sucks also .
neutral	i '_ll never ever ever use bill me later again .
neutral	ugh
neutral	i purchased tickets online but when we got there , they could not find the tickets so we ended_up having to purchase the tickets twice .
neutral	felt_like it was a scam .
neutral	we enjoyed the tour , but would not do it again .
neutral	i found my purchase cheaper in store even before the delivery charge was added .
neutral	poor deal on this occasion
neutral	... i would like to be able to buy as a guest , as one can do for other products .
neutral	they send me the wrong part but delivery was fast
neutral	price - good , quality - okay , packaging was not up to shipping standard and minor repairs were needed to part before install which could not wait for a second try .
neutral	feedback via_email upon shipping would be nice .
neutral	did not really feel the love .
neutral	yes the phone_call i got about the delay was nice but did not feel the person on the other end was sorry for the delay .
neutral	not once was a asked if there was anything they could do for me or that they will speed up my deliver and send it faster .
neutral	was told i would get my glasses in 00 / 00 days and got them in 00 .
neutral	this delay was a shock cuz everytime i checked the website it said it was in the lab even said it after the phone_call about the delay .
neutral	whilst placing an order on line i saw an option for next_day delivery for £ 0 . 00 , i selected this option and my order and payment was accepted .
neutral	i got a confirmation_email_saying my order had been received .
neutral	the next_day i received an_email say my order had been despatched and would arrive in 0 days .
neutral	i called ss and requested a refund for the next_day delivery charge but was refused explaining that the order had been placed after 0pm .
neutral	when i pointed_out that if an option was available and money was taken for this option , which could clearly not be provided , that a warning should flag up during the ordering_process .
neutral	i was told that i should have read the conditions on the website .
neutral	my point is that you took money from me for something you clearly could not provide , therefore , a refund should be given , where has the money gone for the next_day delivery that you clearly have not paid for ?
neutral	our family includes 0 rescue and 0 advanced padi divers , we spend a lot of money on diving and dive equipment , for the sake of £ 0 . 00 do you really want to lose our business then also recieve bad feedback from us to every diver we speak to ?
neutral	your call .
neutral	regards
neutral	ian ball ( father of richard ball )
neutral	i will add more information on item ( size , material photo .... etc )
neutral	and less time for wait purchasing for supplier to customer .
neutral	00days less to 00 or 0 days only !!
neutral	!
neutral	p . s : the price is little expensive than other shopping site !
neutral	the grill i received did not fit but i did some modifications and made it work
neutral	grill was supposed to have a chrome trim .
neutral	did not .
neutral	sold car and gave grill to new owner .
neutral	otherwise would have returned it
neutral	i ordered my card through the lyoness portal to your site , then i was told to go to another site to get a code to get free shipping .
neutral	i did that " copied and pasted " the code , came back through lyoness and on to your site .
neutral	worked great , i got my lyoness benefits , but when i got my card , there was a couples picture on my card and i had my cat on my card .
neutral	so i got a pic on my card that wasn_'_t mine .
neutral	the next time i ordered for my mom , she was ordering two cards of $_000 each , i did the same actions as above but she did not get her benefits , for some reason even_though i know my cookies were attached , they somehow became disconnected .
neutral	so i will make_sure that i never go to any other web_site while going to giftcards . com .
neutral	i made a order 0 / 00 / 00 and as of 0 / 00 / 00 i still_haven_'_t received my order .
neutral	i was told the vendor was supposed to ship it out early this week but it is now wednesday_evening and still no tracking_number .
neutral	should have just paid the few more dollars and ordered it from quadratec or another supplier ..
neutral	ordered on 00 / 0 , today is 00 / 00 and have not received the merchandise i ordered .
neutral	fedex received the merchandise on 00 / 00 and no more update or response till 00 / 00 .
neutral	still in route somewhere ..
neutral	dropping the car off at_gatwick was great .
neutral	the guy was waiting for us at 0 . 00am .
neutral	however , when i tried to call them on our return from the baggage_collection the line was engaged .
neutral	it took over an_hour of constantly calling trying to get through hanging about in the damp and cold before somebody answered .
neutral	he told me someone would come in about 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	after that time , no show so i rang them again and was told he would be there shortly .
neutral	however , it was obvious from our conversation that they didn_'_t have my correct car details .
neutral	eventually my car was returned , about one and three quarter hour late .
neutral	the guy apologised and said they ' d had some problem with another broken down car but the fact i couldn_'_t even get hold of someone for over an_hour was very concerning .
neutral	i ordered a " fuel_pump assembly ".
neutral	before i placed the order , i contacted customer service via_email to see if the " assembly " would include a seal that i had found specified at other online part stores listing the identical part , as an assembly .
neutral	parts_geek '_s answer did not address my question and simply stated that their parts are of high_quality , etc .
neutral	they are of high_quality and priced low , but i had to special order a seal from the local dealership , further delaying the repair .
neutral	it works and the price was not that bad .
neutral	but definitely not free .
neutral	i thought with a 00_%_off sale these were worth trying , i prefer my gloves .
neutral	to each his own ...
neutral	i '_ve never kept bees before and found the pigeon_mountain trading company website to be easy enough .
neutral	i ordered the bees and i '_m glad they had some because others were sold out .
neutral	after that , i didn_'_t get any confirmation of the sale which made me a bit uneasy , i felt has if my order disappeared into the internet void .
neutral	a simple email_confirmation would have been nice .
neutral	they did , however , call when they were ready to ship .
neutral	living in la i was worried_about the transit time .
neutral	it took 0 days to get the bees and the post_office called when they arrived and drove them straight out .
neutral	i cooled them off because it was unusually hot out .
neutral	i removed the instructions but the plastic sleeve was in place on the box so i didn_'_t see the little square piece of wood i was supposed to pry off and instead pried the top half of the box off when trying to place my bees .
neutral	i lost a fair amount of bees doing this .
neutral	a diagram on the instruction_sheet is a must !
neutral	i am a doctor and read instructions perfectly but couldn_'_t figure this one out .
neutral	so after trying to pry the top half of the box off unsuccessfully with bees going everywhere i finally saw the square piece of wood i was supposed to be removing .
neutral	so i removed that square piece of wood and found a tab that ripped_off .
neutral	i then lifted out the syrup feed which was empty and didn_'_t see a queen cage .
neutral	so having never worked with bees before , trying not to panic , i fished out the queen cage in a sea of groggy bees .
neutral	so using my bee brush , i cleaned off some bees and saw a cork i thought i had to remove .
neutral	turns_out , it was the wrong cork , it opened directly to the queen !!!
neutral	the one i was supposed to remove was on the other side but it was so difficult to see the candy in the cage .
neutral	again , a diagram here would have been helpful .
neutral	so i quickly replaced that direct cork and removed the other cork with the candy .
neutral	i then punched a match size hole in the candy per instructions and hung the cage in my top bar hive .
neutral	i swept all the bees inside and hung the package box next to the hive .
neutral	i seemed to also attract a neighboring feral hive that began to smell the honey placed for food inside the hive .
neutral	this got me worried_about robbing .
neutral	i think they were able to battle them away because when i came back i didn_'_t see any signs of robbing .
neutral	0 days_later i returned to the hive to see if the queen made it out of her cage .
neutral	she was still inside the cage so i opened up the direct cork again .
neutral	the queen was in there ( i think , i didn_'_t see any markings on her back ) with other bees , i thought that was odd because i thought there should have only been a queen in there .
neutral	they still didn_'_t come out even with both corks removed so i opened up the screen on side of the cage and let them out directly .
neutral	closed the hive back up and that is where i '_m at now .
neutral	i noticed some of the bees had begun building comb on my top bars closer to the entrance .
neutral	overall , a pretty rough ride that i think could have ended_up a lot worse had i not have stayed calm .
neutral	i was lucky i didn_'_t kill too many bees or the queen .
neutral	i think pictures or a diagram on the hiving instructions would be a great improvement and an_email_confirmation when an order is placed regarding the bee shipping process would be more comforting .
neutral	i started_using origin because it was pushed on me for mass_effect 0 .
neutral	since then i '_ve bought a few games that are supposed to activate on origin , but the keys weren_'_t recognized - for example , a bundle of spore + the expansion - the expansion activated on origin , but the game didn_'_t !
neutral	i had to contact customer service and it took 00_mins in chat with them to get them to sort the key out .
neutral	i bought sim_city 0 on origin , and managed to actually play the game ( i '_m lucky there !
neutral	), but the servers were really over - loaded and the trouble seems to have spilled over to origin itself , not just the game , because many of my friends are having_trouble opening origin chats with me .
neutral	i like the games on the service , but the service itself is far too flaky these days and the drm they use is draconian .
neutral	according to ups web_site , still in caldwell , wv .
neutral	not due to arrive in nettie , wv until0 / 0 .
neutral	i bought 0 times and one was missing .
neutral	anyway the quality of the items i received was okay .
neutral	the dresses had a new and interesting design and fit better_than_expected .
neutral	the hat was nice and pretty warm and cute but skirt was missing .
neutral	maybe it is coming in a separate order .
neutral	i hope so .
neutral	i went in looking for michelin_tires .
neutral	i usually get them at costco but they were out of the ones i needed .
neutral	town_fair was also out of them but the salesman recommended cooper tires as " just as good as the michelins but without paying for the michelin name ".
neutral	since i ' d heard of cooper i decided to take them .
neutral	the job was promised for 0 hours .
neutral	two hours and forty_minutes later i rushed out of there only to notice later that the " cooper " tires were actually " mastercraft ", an offshoot of the cooper company .
neutral	the words " mastercraft " were never spoken to me at the dealership and the final price was $ 0 less_than what i ' d have paid for the michelins at costco .
neutral	in addition , i had to return the next_day because the car was vibrating at highway speeds .
neutral	that issue was resolved but i feel deceived by this " bait and switch " tactic .
neutral	i will not be going back .
neutral	i have a dell p000w printer .
neutral	the color was not true .
neutral	the pictures had horizontal streaks .
neutral	especially when it was set for best results .
neutral	haven_'_t used it for any thing else yet .
neutral	i have not been in contact with inkfarm . com
neutral	did not know that billing would be in advance of stay booked .
neutral	i used to paying when i finish my checkout .
neutral	spell this out so people will not be surprise ?
neutral	the room was large , clean , comfortable , but took several calls and over half_hour to have luggage delivered to room and very long time and again several calls to have movie channel activated .
neutral	we were surprised and disappointed .
neutral	people were friendly and apologetic .
neutral	they are knowledgeable but don_'_t say you are going to wait , they just take too_long
neutral	address was right on invoice but wrong on envelope
neutral	the compressor i ordered stated it came with the required o_rings .
neutral	they were not in the box , i spent 0 hours locally to find 0 orings .
neutral	the quality of the parts were fine .
neutral	great concept but advertising continues to grow making it harder and harder to find relevant friend postings .
neutral	company is obsessed with self promotion which will lead to its decline .
neutral	product is of great quality and sound is always good and predictable .
neutral	pricey products and company places to much value on the brand .
neutral	great site to download from unless you are using a cnet exclusive product which is always hard to get registered .
neutral	have registered some products online 00 times and when i access the software still receive message the product is unregistered .
neutral	part ordered was exact , but delivery of this product was horrible , took 00 days for a box that weighed less_than a pound or 0 to arrive .
neutral	... bitter sweet !
neutral	i would be happy to comply with your request for a review but i have not yet received the items i ordered .
neutral	efficient service , however after an 00 hour flight delay we returned to the car packed our_luggage and drove off .
neutral	only when we stopped for fuel did we notice that the drivers door had been marked possibly by another car door .
neutral	so really disappointed .
neutral	everything was fine but this last order contained a remanufactured part that is an exact_match but it '_s very noisy .
neutral	it is a rear_wiper_motor part # 00 - 0000 ordered on 0 / 00 / 00 and when corresponding with partsgeek to arrange the return of the old part for my core_deposit refund i made mention of the noisy part .
neutral	they sent me an_email with return instructions but completely disregarded my mention of the noisy part .
neutral	i '_m not happy about this and i have to say that their ranking has slipped downward because of this .
neutral	maybe i should seek out some other_suppliers .
neutral	the regular discounts are great .
neutral	however , there is a very limited selection for where i live compared to some other_sites .
neutral	i purchased a pair monroe rear_shocks for a 0000 sienna .
neutral	i ordered them because i wanted to support michigan and the us manufacturers .
neutral	unfortunately they did not install properly with the bushings that came with the new shocks and i had to use the old_ones .
neutral	happy with parts , no info .
neutral	on core_return or core gharge on invoice , went on website to return cores and read you have to return cores in 00 days , it would be nice to know that upfront , not happy about that .
neutral	0nd_class_post took 00 days - too_long !!!
neutral	!
neutral	product and delivery time is very good , although i left instructions when i ordered to leave the product in the porch and i even left the porch door open and stuck a note on my porch wlindow to leave the product they still took my grass away because they required a signature .
neutral	luckily my neighbour was around the second time to sign for it , else they would have taken it away for a second time and i would have had to cancel .
neutral	key didn_'_t work right_away - slow service
neutral	good software but you need a way to temporarily disable it , as when doing a system restore , etc .
neutral	some s / w won_'_t install when bit_defender is running .
neutral	it gets old deleting and then restoring bit_defender to accomodate system restores and some s / w .
neutral	again , you need an easy way to temporarily disable bit_defender .
neutral	let_me start by saying that when i travel i want relaxation and comfort .
neutral	when i decided to book a room here i did mentioned that i would need a shower bench for my wife .
neutral	only to find that no shower bench was available at check in .
neutral	we had driven for 0 hours to get to austin and my wife had to wait to the next_day to shower .
neutral	the next_day i had to call the front_desk to check the situation regarding the shower bench .
neutral	when i travel i plan and budget so when i '_m told there will be a shower bench then i expect one .
neutral	call quality within the united_states has_been ok .
neutral	however , the connection quality of the few international_calls to japan we have made have been poor .
neutral	ik had een kaartje uit de selectie op jullie website besteld , kreeg tot mijn verbazing de mededeling dat_de layout niet ok was en of ik deze opnieuw wilde inzenden .
neutral	na_een mailtje was het opgelost .
neutral	i needed to buy some spare parts for a grundfos pump and contacted anchor by telephone .
neutral	the call was answered quickly , however , the person on the other end of the line was not interested in helping and simply told me to look on the internet .
neutral	i am sure that they answer a lot of calls each day - but a little politeness and enthusiasm would go a long why when you are being_ripped - off £_00 + p_&_p_+_vat for a bit of bent plastic !
neutral	this gives us a nice opportunity to avoid wasting time with the phone cards .
neutral	sales_person seemed bothered by my call and not too eager to help .
neutral	he wasn_'_t very informative or forthcoming with any helpful suggestions or questions about exactly_what product i was interested in or how , what i was going to use it for .
neutral	fortunately i had a rough_idea already what i wanted , but it would have been more helpful if i had other choices i might consider .
neutral	it would be nice if customer_services , do what they say they going to do .
neutral	ecken durch das falten nicht sehr schön .
neutral	well my parts came in normal timing , but i had a question about my parts and i tried_calling but i jus got a recording and the website was down so i couldn_'_t text no one really caused a lot of confusion , also when placing the order there was place to use my $_00 off coupon so that sucked .
neutral	not a good experience this time around
neutral	could not book car_rental online so had to book by phone .
neutral	the conversation was extremely difficult as i was unable to understand the person on the other end , and he couldnt understand me .
neutral	eventually i managed to reserve a car but it took four goes at paying for it as he kept getting the card number wrong .
neutral	the whole call took 00_minutes .
neutral	the price online was £_00 cheaper_than we ended_up paying which was very disappointing .
neutral	if a price is quoted you should stick by it .
neutral	we have booked car_rentals through you quite a few_times in the past with no_problems but may think_twice in the future .
neutral	when i first joined in 0000 jamplay was great .
neutral	lots of lessons , numerous jamchat sessions .
neutral	and generally a smooth running web_site .
neutral	lately ( last few_months ) the quality of the experience has dropped significantly in the following ways :
neutral	0 .)
neutral	service has_been spotty .
neutral	their forum has_been up and down and their jamchats also have had problems recently .
neutral	this wasn_'_t the case when i first joined .
neutral	0 .)
neutral	many new lessons are added each week but the variety is not great .
neutral	as as example , don ross started a series which hasn_'_t been updated since march although numerous other instructors have had many lessons added .
neutral	they need to distribute their lessons a bit more equitably .
neutral	0 ) you need a fairly powerful / new machine to avoid audio / visual lag when viewing lessons otherwise it is hard to watch .
neutral	0 ) security is too tight for a non_- financial site .
neutral	if you use the site several_times a day you have to keep logging back in .
neutral	i like jamplay and will_continue to be a member but they do need to resolve these issues
neutral	i was very excited to find the book about richard boone at oldies , but haven_'_t received it yet .
neutral	i know sometimes it may take 0_weeks or more , but am beginning to get concerned

neutral	i have a large air boot that i wear from a torn achilles tendon .
neutral	i asked about a room on the first floor .
neutral	i was told all of the first floor rooms were taken .
neutral	since there were no elevators in the motel , it was difficult to make it up the stairs with my bags and up and down the stairs each day .
neutral	you may want to consider holding back some of the first floor rooms for elderly and folks like me who have a hard time with stairs .
neutral	i have dealt_with better companies
neutral	i called the company and asked questions about purchasing a nuc .
neutral	due to my work schedule i asked for help in choosing a delivery date .
neutral	the employee i spoke with helped_me determine that the 0rd week of april would fit my schedule .
neutral	next i then created an account with all my contact information and shipping address .
neutral	i made the purchase online and received a confirmation number with a delivery date of the 0rd week of april .
neutral	well the 0rd week of april arrived and no nuc .
neutral	i called on 0 - 0 - 00 and they stated that they were running behind schedule by 0_weeks .
neutral	so , i asked the employee i could pick another delivery date and they assisted .
neutral	i stated to her that at no point in time was i ever contacted and told that my purchase was not going to arrive on time .
neutral	after_speaking with the employee we were able to workout a new delivery date after 0 - 00 - 00 .
neutral	i chose to purchase from pmtc due to several of my friends helping with my interest in bee keeping and the great experience they received when dealing_with pmtc .
neutral	a 00_% deposit is required for this purchase i just feel that i committed to use their service and paid as requested .
neutral	i understand that business is ever changing especially dealing_with nature .
neutral	just have the courtesy to inform your customer that you are not going to complete the order in the time it was requested so i came make_adjustments to receive your product .
neutral	i received my coins all in one bag through usps .
neutral	the coins are in mint_condition , but being in one bag they got dings and scratches from banging into each other .
neutral	also shipping seemed slow with no tracking available .
neutral	so_far i have taken 0 classes with netcom .
neutral	the first time it was not good .
neutral	the instructor was unprepared so the lessons were all over the place .
neutral	also , we were doing a 0 day class in 0 days .
neutral	but the second class was much_better .
neutral	the instructor was excellent and the material was covered well .
neutral	i took both classes remotely and there were only networking issues with the second class .
neutral	several of us who were off - site dropped connections a few_times during the week .
neutral	but the techies got this up and running quickly each time .
neutral	i have another class coming up soon so i '_ll see what happenes then .
neutral	bis auf ein_paar kleine fehler , die es wohl bei jedem anbieter geben wird , kann_ich hrs mit ruhigem gewissen empfehlen .
neutral	it took me 0 different calls and a total of 0 . 0 - 0 . 0 hours of hold time to finally get through to a customer agent for a reorder and return_authorization .
neutral	i got the return_authorization for the return from the agent at the time of the replacement order or i would possibly have to go through that ordeal again .
neutral	parts pricing can '_t be beat in most_cases , however getting though on a phone line is another matter .
neutral	quick service , but they decided to ship all items to the billing_address even after having called to verify that the two addresses were correct .
neutral	since i travel by foot from my office to the subway in nyc and then to grand central terminal to take a commuter train , and then by foot to home , this was not convenient at all .
neutral	there are lots of stairs to go up and own , the subways are very crowded and hot ( it was august ) and lugging cast_iron pumps and fittings like this with a bad back was uncalled for .
neutral	otherwise no_problems .
neutral	the hardware is very good , but the specs and price is a bit too much .
neutral	please add ubuntu compatibility !
neutral	the server wrapper is good , but it crashes a lot
neutral	internet online transaction was ok , received on time however failed at delivery of the flowers when delivery person could not provide information from whom flowers were sent .
neutral	delivery person telephoned office who could only advise that it was sent by someone writing in english !
neutral	overall , my experience with phone_power has_been good .
neutral	however , they did little to help me port my existing phone_number with me to phone_power .
neutral	i was very disappointed with that .
neutral	i was giving a fair price for insurance
neutral	j ' ai_commandé un maillot pour mon fils avec son prénom ( alexandre ).
neutral	j ' ai_été appelé quelque jours plus tard pour me dire que c ' était trop long et que_je devais le modifier .
neutral	je comprends que_le prénom de_mon fils soit trop long , par_contre c ' est dommage que lorsque l ' on commande le flocage il n ' y a pas d ' avertissement en disant que_le flocage peut - être trop long ou quelque chose comme ça .
neutral	du coup cela a retardé ma_commande et_j ' ai_eu juste le temps d ' avoir le maillot la veille de l ' anniversaire de_mon fils .
neutral	dommage .
neutral	0 order .
neutral	0 shipments .
neutral	arrived at different days .
neutral	almost0 weeks for the last sshipment to arrive even_though it was in stock .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	i had a lot of trouble filling_out out the billing / shipping information during checkout .
neutral	it tried to automatically fill in certain fields based on zip_code .
neutral	when i had to change the zip , it got weird .
neutral	i filled_out several fields , scrolled up to check something , then scrolled back down and my entries were gone .
neutral	very frustrating , but i eventually was able to place my order .
neutral	local calls are good in most_cases .
neutral	bad voice quality when calling mobile_phones or international numbers .
neutral	still_waiting for one if the two pair i ordered , been more than 0_weeks ... not acceptable , will buy in a store next time , not online
neutral	as an_email subscriber i was keen to use a recent discount_code we had received .
neutral	spent 0 hours trying to process a booking which was extremely frustrating .
neutral	tried from my emails and on 0 computers and a smartphone and with 0 different valued discount_codes but there was always an error / glitch which prevented me from finsalising the booking or payment process .
neutral	finally when i did access the payment section it would not accept any discount_codes and by now it had crossed midnight into the day of travel .
neutral	this meant the cost went up and we ended_up apying £_00 more than our original " discounted " quote which for a 0 day park is a fair increase .
neutral	after finally completing and arriving at the airport the process was extremely easy .
neutral	good directions , easy to park , great bus service on drop_off and pick_up .
neutral	very quick to arrive and leave airport .
neutral	polite drivers .
neutral	would use again if booking process not an issue
neutral	pleased with trousers and shorts , appear good quality and fit , however , i ordered the trousers for a specific evening out - unfortunately the delivery took_longer_than advertised and they arrived after my night out .
neutral	let_me preface this review with the positives_: the customer_support system is top - notch .
neutral	the automated phone system is simple and user_friendly , and every time i was transferred to a live representative , i had zero hold time and all the reps i spoke to were excellent and very professional .
neutral	this is the reason i gave 0_stars ; the rest of the experience has_been subpar ...
neutral	at about 0am sunday_night / monday_morning i ordered a virtual_gift_card because i didn_'_t want to wait for a physical gift_card to be mailed to me .
neutral	i received an_email within an_hour that the gift_card was emailed to the recipient , but this was not the case .
neutral	the next_day i checked that my payment posted , but no gift_card yet , and the only_thing noted on my order status was that it processed .
neutral	on tuesday i called support -- first , the automated phone system looked up my order and said the order shipped today .
neutral	i then transferred myself to a live_person and she advised me she would have the system send the card again .
neutral	an_hour later i called support again and spoke to a different rep who said there is sometimes an issue sending to yahoo . com email_addresses ; she escalated to her_supervisor and assured me she would know how to process the order so i would receive it .
neutral	shortly_afterwards i received ( again ) the email_stating the card was emailed to the recipient , but alas , no card was emailed to the recipient .
neutral	at_least an_hour after that i called back yet again and explained my experience so_far , and the rep put me on hold ( for a very reasonable_amount of time ) to speak with her_supervisor .
neutral	she then told me the particular process for sending to my yahoo account could take 0 to 0 hours .
neutral	i thanked her and said i would wait at_least 0 hours and call back if i still had not received it .
neutral	five or so hours_later i spoke to yet another rep who verified with her_supervisor that she could ship to a different email address since we ' d had trouble with yahoo .
neutral	i gave her my gmail address and she said it may take a while for me to receive it due to their system being worked on or upgraded or something .
neutral	it '_s now 0 . 0 hours after that 0th call into support and i '_m down $_000 bucks with nothing to show for it .
neutral	i can '_t say that i '_m pleased with giftcards . com so_far ... although i will reiterate that at_least when i '_ve called support , it '_s been a pleasantly stress - free experience .
neutral	i ' d really like to get the virtual_gift_card that i paid for , though .
neutral	i wonder_if i should have just ordered a physical card and have it mailed .
neutral	maybe i ' d have it by now .
neutral	web_site could have told me the first part was the wrong one
neutral	been a customer for a long time , but mnust say i often pass on a product since description and picture is not great .
neutral	need more specifics on cloth content , and such detail as button down or point collars etc .
neutral	ordered centric rotors and pads all the way around .
neutral	rotors arrived new and sealed , rear pads were new and sealed .
neutral	the front pads however came in an oily box and parts were dirty and greasy !
neutral	the parts looked as if someone had attempted a brake job and found they had the wrong pads .
neutral	this was very disappointing to receive parts in this condition , i would have returned them until i went to look at the policy , it pretty_much sucks .
neutral	also there is no customer service number to call .
neutral	i decided to keep the dirty parts after googling to see if all the parts were present that would come in a new box , and they were .
neutral	so i spent and extra 00 min cleaning parts and debuting the backer plates on the pads .
neutral	if i knew i was getting used or returned parts that were still functional as new , i would have only purchased them if they had been discounted .
neutral	this was my second it chase from parts_geek and my last .
neutral	the only reason i gave a three star_rating is because the centric cryogenic rotors and posi - quiet pads are awesome , but i '_m done with parts_geek !
neutral	the ordering of the book was quick and painless .
neutral	but the shipping time was very slow .
neutral	it was a good thing i did not need the book for two_weeks .
neutral	the rental book is not in the best shape .
neutral	the cover has many folds as well as some pages are lose .
neutral	but hey it was the cheapest rental and i can deal with it for the cost savings .
neutral	shipping was quick , the quality of the coffee not as good for what they charge .
neutral	i much rather buy from nespresso and pay $. 00_cents more per capsule .
neutral	an ok solution for the real devolper .
neutral	be prepared to have to edit everything if you want a real functioning professional site .
neutral	go somewhere_else unless you are prepared for all of this !
neutral	having over $_00 of handling ( over 00_% of the order total ) not included in the estimate online caused headaches and dissatisfaction while working with affordable_buttons .
neutral	i will be pursuing other options in the future
neutral	my first purchase was some duck treats .
neutral	the tracking site link in the shipping email stated it was coming via_fed_ex however final delivery was via_usps .
neutral	the tracking_information showed extremely slow progress .
neutral	i hope my future_purchases arrive in a more timely_manner .
neutral	well , i tried to order on line but was shut out from the site .
neutral	frankly it was not too friendly to my thinking and there was no ' help '.
neutral	then i called three_times .
neutral	first two times about 0 : 00 am .
neutral	recording said no one was there and hung_up .
neutral	next time , simply no answer .
neutral	finally after a week i got to speak with a person .
neutral	he was very helpful , stuck with a couple issues and got the order placed .
neutral	this was late friday .
neutral	the item didn_'_t ship until the next monday .
neutral	would have liked some ship action rather_than a two day wait , especially after all the other difficulties .
neutral	in short , a lot of ' stuff ' didn_'_t go right .
neutral	but the price was good .
neutral	the quality of the item was fine .
neutral	so , yes , i would do this again , but only because my information is supposed to be ' in the system '.
neutral	i have a problem with the product and wish 0wd would have been willing to work with the manufacturer to come up with a solution .
neutral	the suggested solution was to buy yet another product which would have significantly added to the cost of the project .
neutral	i bought a 00 dollar card which came to 00 total .
neutral	for the code right_away and it worked_perfectly .
neutral	the game i wanted was 00 . 00 so i tried to buy a 00 dollar card .
neutral	the site had a daily spending_limit of 00 for new users .
neutral	this was a pain .
neutral	otherwise is a good service for people overseas like myself .
neutral	i was on hold to speak with someone at the help_desk for over 00_minutes ... need i say more .
neutral	an then the order did not make it before_christmas .
neutral	i understand there was some_confusion with the cc but they had my phone_number .
neutral	a call would have saved two_days of emailing .
neutral	i still don_'_t have the order !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	coloplast speedi - cath 00 " hydrophphillic coated male intermittent catheter is too stiff , too rigid
neutral	quality if unints excellent with an excellent choice of sizes and styles .
neutral	advice at showroom and helpfullnes excellent .
neutral	however - advvice on ordering and delivery very poor .
neutral	though there are pages on the website , it is not very user_friendly and easy to mis_- interpret .
neutral	it does not make it clear that for the basic service , even_though you know the week when your kitchen should be ready , ther is not flexibility as to it '_s delivery - in fact you do not know until the day before it arrives .
neutral	there is also little information as to fitting components that come with it .
neutral	they do not provide wall fixings for base units .
neutral	though some of the problems with the order were sorted_out very quickly , others were not .
neutral	i got the comment - ' it '_s never happened before ' when i reported that i could not dismantle a dry fix unit as the legs had been fitted over the screws .
neutral	i had to email twice before i got a call about non refund of my jig deposit and this was 0_weeks after returning it .
neutral	in sumary - pre sales excellent but after sales needs a lot of improvement
neutral	hi , we ordered 0 trunk_struts and 0 hood_struts for a 0000 jag vanden plas . we only received 0 trunk_struts .
neutral	please send the 0 hood_struts we paid for .
neutral	thanks , tony heyworth
neutral	the coverage i receive is adequate , although not as competitive as a recent offer i began receiving from amex which is the same price and includes all 0 reports two times a month .
neutral	also , as a mac user your website is not very mac friendly , it doesn_'_t look nearly as sharp as other_websites in the same category and isn_'_t easy to navigate .
neutral	graphics are often misplaced , way too big , or missing when viewed on a macintosh .
neutral	the same can be said of the ios_app .
neutral	it is so bad i never even use it anymore .
neutral	overall i '_ve been mostly happy with my service , but more competitive offers are starting to draw me away and i '_m thinking of leaving for another service .
neutral	i '_ll stick around a few more months to see if your pricing / product changes , but if nothing happens i '_ll likely leave for the amex or other similar offer .
neutral	kirsty on the 0000 number most helpful but would have preferred to book online , kept coming up with ' we cannot find the rate you are looking for '...?
neutral	i could not believe_how fast the order arrived ( 0 day ).
neutral	the contents were intact and undamaged .
neutral	i have not yet installed the parts , so i cannot coment on the quality of the parts i ordered .
neutral	the product is ok . made in china , and the finish on one run is a bit iffy .
neutral	but after all said , it is worth the money .
neutral	as usual they didn_'_t have the car i ordered so ended_up with something not quite as good ..
neutral	poor comms at times goods got there in the end .
neutral	good value if time is not the most_important_thing
neutral	ordered two items but they only had one item left in stock
neutral	the shopping was easy and fast .
neutral	i was a little dissapointed when i did the full version instead of the upgrade and when the older version un - installed a pop - up offered the same product i just purchased for $ 0 less .
neutral	why wasnt i offered the best price the first time ?
neutral	it '_s like 00_% lower .
neutral	dissapointed
neutral	generally i receive my products in acceptable and useable shape .
neutral	in the past i have received products that did not work or arrived with damage .
neutral	i ordered a 0 input small pa that did not work at all .
neutral	i callede mcm and they told me the product was dicontinued and it was no_longer available .
neutral	they instructed me to send it back and they would credit my account .
neutral	instead , i took it to audio wizard , an electronics repair store .
neutral	they repaired it for
neutral	$_00 . 00 .
neutral	it had a bad transfornmer in it .
neutral	i was nto happy that i had to repair an item that arrived new .
neutral	i also received a speaker with screws missing on the speaker and crushed grill .
neutral	i order a lot of stuff from mcm .
neutral	these are the only two times i have had a bad result
neutral	you would think that when your buying a $_000 . 00 plus mirror that is fragile , you would have it packaged better .
neutral	the box was paper_thin and only had two pieces of foam inside , when i opened it two tabs wear busted off and the exterior of the mirror had a inch long crack .
neutral	but i couldn_'_t wait to send it back and wait to get another one cause of how poor the packaging was .
neutral	the one liner says it all - only by the swift involvement of another member of staff did the goods arrive
neutral	guten tag
neutral	bei_der preisangabe steht , " inkl .
neutral	taxen und gebühren ".
neutral	kreditkartengebühren werden trotzdem verrechnet .
neutral	unsere freunde in hamburg haben uns vom gebuchten hotel abgeraten , gestern wollten wir das hotel annullieren und zu_einem teureren hotel wechseln .
neutral	die dame am telefon meinte , dass das hotel terminus keine stornierungen akzeptiere , obwohl auf_der homepage steht " stornierungen kostenlos ".
neutral	ihre stellungnahme würde uns interessieren .
neutral	besten dank .
neutral	viewing tracking_information was impossible , checking order status always came back as " in warehouse ".
neutral	after one full week of waiting i was making plans to call and find out where my parts were , and why they hadn_'_t even left the warehouse , but lo and behold the package was at my door .
neutral	the parts i ordered were bosch brand , they didn_'_t state bosch india and i was fully expecting bosh germany , no real grievance there .
neutral	prices are competitive and searching the site is easy .
neutral	i would probably use them again , just know you won_'_t know when your package is coming .
neutral	fast and affordable tire service .
neutral	however they said i needed a new tpms_sensor to get tge light off .
neutral	0 sensors later an 0 resets my tpms_sensor light stil on no resolution in sight .
neutral	my part '_s were good but the gasket_set was not the right set
neutral	as if it is not bad enough , this site has no way to communication on line for the billing , cancellation , etc .
neutral	this is not a user_friendly , consumer concentric organization .
neutral	find the same services for no charge .
neutral	we booked some flyets for vietnam and everything was ok .
neutral	we were very pleased with the price and quality of the pump and filter .
neutral	the only disappointment was the fact the pump was ordered as a pump and screen kit and it came without the screen .
neutral	ordered 0 different items .
neutral	all showed as being ' in stock '.
neutral	two of the items were back ordered .
neutral	what gives ?
neutral	am cumparata un hdd , o unitate optica si o imprimanta ... dar dupa doua zile am_primit doar hdd -_ul .
neutral	am sunat la oktal si mi - au confirmat ca este livrata si restul marfii , am insistat si atunci au verificat din nou si au constatat ca marfa e inca la_ei in depozit .
neutral	in cele din urma dupa inca o zi marfa a ajuns la mine .
neutral	in rest au_fost foarte amabili atat la service ( nota 00 +) cat si_la vanzari .
neutral	recomandarea mea ar fi ca cei de_la vanzari sa stiu un minim de detalii tehnice .
neutral	was about worth what i paid for it .
neutral	no outstanding value .
neutral	good price , part looks great .
neutral	shipping was slow as could be , and cost me more than other parts places i have used .
neutral	my other issue was i dont like not knowing if the part is in stock or not before i order it , if i can '_t cancel the order .
neutral	i am a guy and when i want something i want it now , after i placed the order then i get the rules about cancelling the order .. assbackwards and it made me wonder wtf
neutral	again as far as parts , good shape and good parts ...
neutral	shopping came on time and substituted items were acceptable , but a bottle of jeyes fluid have been badly packed and had leaked all over dog biscuits , bread and some other items , while asda did refund cost of same it still meant we were without those items necessitating a trip to the supermarket anyway !
neutral	ran_into problems because it was hard to communicate with the seller and parts got delivered after 0_weeks when i payed extra for 0 day shipment .
neutral	my order has_been 0 days and still not arrived , i contacted the customer_services and they were very helpfull and apologetic , they shipped me out another order straight_away for which arrived the next_day , despite this inconvinience i would use the store again due to its prices and great offers !
neutral	will recomend to friends in future
neutral	zuerst zum negativen .
neutral	der goldstatus ist ein witz .
neutral	alle paypal bestellungen gehen bis 00 uhr noch am selben tag raus ... pustekuchen .
neutral	hatte mich direkt an den support gewendet und_der sagte mir etwas komplett anderes .
neutral	ging am_nächsten tag dann raus .
neutral	und kam dann am 0 .
neutral	tag nach bestellung an .
neutral	versteht mich nicht falsch aber dann hätte ich mir den goldstatus auch sparren können .
neutral	sonst war_alles klasse .
neutral	kundenservice antwortete immer zeitig , ware war top verpackt und funktioniert problemlos .
neutral	keine weiteren beanstandungen .
neutral	gerne_wieder , aber nur wenn_ich für_die_lieferung mehr zeit habe und ohne gold status .
neutral	the site has a weird interface for payments when typing the card .
neutral	i buy my tires at tft for all 0 family vehicles .
neutral	i feel that over the past 0 years it has_been increasingly tough to get service at the store , long_waits just to talk with someone .
neutral	long_waits to just to get tires_rotated or lug_nuts checked .
neutral	no reservations .
neutral	tft is starting to make me think of alternative tire stores .
neutral	the free services offered with purchase at times do seem like they are worth it with the long wait times .
neutral	the service provided by selectspecs was exemplary , my glasses were reglazed within 00 days which was good however the lens quality wasn_'_t up to stratch ( if you pardon the pun ) after a month '_s normal usage the lenses on the glasses have became rather scratched , despite the " anti_- scratch protection ".
neutral	this could be down to the fact that i ordered the cheapo lenses which have to have a coating applied whereas with higher index lenses the material they are made from is naturally scratch_resistant .
neutral	i would order from them in the future though , just not get the cheap lenses .
neutral	order was placed 0 may
neutral	received 00 may
neutral	unfortunately the jiffy_bag got wet and the contents could have been lost .
neutral	fortunately nothing was lost
neutral	i was determined to be early for the appointment to get my tyres_fitted so i arrived at the industrial_estate fifteen_minutes early .
neutral	i looked for signs to the tyre_fitters but could not see them .
neutral	i drove round the estate twice and still could not find the place .
neutral	i telephoned blackcircles and was told that they could not give me the number for the fitter due to data protection rules which is wrong .
neutral	that is an excuse used by people who can ; t explain when things go_wrong .
neutral	i got a call back from blackircles with directions .
neutral	when i got to the workshop i was dealt_with very efficiently and with great courtesy .
neutral	when i told the owner of the workshop that i was not allowed to have their phone_number he was not very happy .
neutral	when i received my invoice the telephone_number from the company was at the top so th excuse of not giving me the number was proved to be rubbish . there is no data protection rules which stop anyone giving out telephone_numbers to businesses .
neutral	this must be used by blackcircles to stop a customer ringing the workshop to arrange an_alternate deal .
neutral	good delivery , eliquids good quality .
neutral	sent email about poor quality of cartomisers bought from them , got no reply feel let_down .
neutral	maybe they just reply to favourable messages
neutral	delivery date very good but unfortunately the packaging was dented which impacted on the product ordered .
neutral	everything has_been exemplary with djkit . com in the past but i was concerned this time to receive an_email from djkit telling_me that my bank had declined to make the payment for the goods that i had ordered .
neutral	this is something that has never happened to me in my life and i became extremely worried .
neutral	the email suggested that i rang them to make the payment and when i did i was informed that their computer system had gone wrong and that the payment had actually gone_through .
neutral	it disappointed me that i was the one to have to phone djkit , whereas i feel that they should have emailed or called me as soon as they found the error .
neutral	good : sales guy was helpful and even did price match on item .
neutral	bad : item didn_'_t ship for 0 days and then only ships ground .
neutral	when i inquired on why item didn_'_t ship .
neutral	i received no response at all .
neutral	i don_'_t remember what i bought from you .
neutral	in the future put the product purchased in the email .
neutral	then i would love to rate your performance .
neutral	the prices are low and you can not find lower prices , however , the shipping cost is a bit_pricey .
neutral	i have used pg a few_times before with extremely good results and have recommended to many people .
neutral	unfortunately , this time i had a bit of an unpleasant_experience after purchasing a part that didn_'_t work .
neutral	the company ( auto continental ) advised that the part was not faulty yet it didn_'_t work in my car and couldn_'_t be programmed .
neutral	ac said they would re - test and if it worked for them then send it back out even_though it did not work in my car .
neutral	i had gone to the expense of mechanic labour and postage back to them , yet they would only offer a refund less the postage paid and a 00_% handing fee .
neutral	in the end , after numerous_emails they offered a full_refund .
neutral	it has tainted my opinion of using pg slighty but i '_m sure i '_ll be back when needed .
neutral	i do have to say that the level of communication from ac was excellent and i think in the end they were fair to me , it just to a few weeks to sort .
neutral	these_guys are good , but if you need a dependable company to ship your items where you know they are still frozen , be_careful .
neutral	usually takes an extra day for delivery than you think , dry_ice is long gone by then .
neutral	generally great steaks , good chicken , sure wish they had their sausage still , that is what set them apart !
neutral	while it was very easy to book , when we arrived at the room we booked , it was not at all like the photos .
neutral	the photos showed an updated room with refrigerator and kitchenette .
neutral	it was clean , neat and bright .
neutral	when we arrived it was old , used hard and only had two double_beds , tv , coffee_maker and that was all .
neutral	the experience seemed ok wil know more once the auto del kicks in .
neutral	the delivery took to long to get to the east_coast .
neutral	wag . com offers 0 - 0 shipping no matter the location .
neutral	can you ?
neutral	i have purchased vhs movies two times .
neutral	the first time i ordered 00 tapes but only received 00 .
neutral	the 0nd time i ordered 00 and i only received 0 tape .
neutral	i wasn_'_t charged for the tapes that didn_'_t come .
neutral	the tapes say they are available on your website when you buy them .
neutral	it '_s frustrating because your the only site i can find that has multiple vhs titles , but it seems most of them aren_'_t even available .
neutral	initial pickup did not occur , despite_repeated_attempts to confirm .
neutral	after some more direct followup , clubs were shipped on time .
neutral	but - this is supposed to be a seamless service , and it was far from it .
neutral	i would be hesitant to use again .
neutral	here is the problem is you order the parts and expect the parts to be shipped in box that is big enough to safely transport the parts without damage .
neutral	example … grill measures 00 ” across and they put it 00 ” box and ups does what they do best crush , mangle and destroy the box .
neutral	if you pay extra for the insurance i would think it should cover shipping the broken part back to the shipper at no charge to me .
neutral	i received a rma along with a note_saying i can it ship it back with any shipping company of my choice .
neutral	of course i have to pay for the shipping myself which was more than the cost of the grill for my truck .
neutral	your shipping_costs were too high .
neutral	i could have ordered locally through an autoparts_store and only paid sales_tax - my mistake .
neutral	timely in delivery but the costs to get it to me through amazon were greater than the value you provided .
neutral	when the service works , it works well .
neutral	although , retailers have told me it takes one hour from when the order is placed until delivery . com informs them .
neutral	my only real complaint , is many_times when ordering from restaurants they have been closed or not delivering for the day .
neutral	it took quite a while for delivery . com to notify me of this with barely an_apology .
neutral	other food online ordering systems have called me and apologized with a coupon .
neutral	that is much_better customer service .
neutral	the product is of sound quality but the suppliers are undoubtedly charging premium rates for these products .
neutral	it would be good to see espares with their buying power put pressure on these suppliers to reduce the prices .
neutral	no way should a bottle retaining bar for a fridge cost £_00 !.
neutral	good service and fast delivery .
neutral	fridge seal purchased for same fridge was £_00 !
neutral	nuts !
neutral	parts look ok but shipping was very slow
neutral	impossible to return an item
neutral	pcgamesupply . com is one of the very few websites where i can buy canadian psn_cards .
neutral	the biggest upsides are that the website is easy to browse and the service is lightning - fast once the purchase is confirmed .
neutral	however , i '_ve had issues with the confirmation process .
neutral	my orders have gotten reversed numerous_times , sometimes because i ' d try to buy two or more cards at once , and sometimes i just don_'_t know why .
neutral	it '_s also asked me to reconfirm my identity three_times in the last six_months , even_though i '_m always using the same computer .
neutral	what '_s up with that ?
neutral	all in all , i '_m happy to have found sucka slick website that offers game_cards , i just wish orders were confirmed more easily .
neutral	they were good but my glasses don_'_t fit right and they give me a headache ...
neutral	i ordered a number of parts one being a hood_release cable .
neutral	the cable was smashed so bad it was nit working .
neutral	i already had the old broken part out so i had no choice but to make it work .
neutral	no one should have to modify new parts .
neutral	i have used partsgeek so many other times and had no real problem .
neutral	i will_continue to order here , just inspect the parts more thoural even if the package looks in good shape .
neutral	website should indicate the glasses will be a backorder if not available on the order screen .
neutral	they took along time to arrive .
neutral	i would have chosen another pair initially if they were going to be a backorder .
neutral	this would have improved the experience
neutral	i signed_up to ! st rate spares hoping to get some much needed parts for my citroen berlingo multispace , but alas so_far , i have to say that nothing has happened yet !
neutral	however , i '_m a patient person so i '_ll keep my fingers_crossed and wait ..........!!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a tail_light for my audi_a0 , to find out that they made two types for this year , 00 .
neutral	i have been trying to return or exchange this for over a week now .
neutral	you can not get a live_person to help you .
neutral	i only have received one email after i went to the web_site to start the return process , it has_been well over the 00_hours as stated .
neutral	i had to order the correct light from e_bay , can '_t wait for the parts_geek no more !
neutral	i still need to return this part , and still_waiting for help !
neutral	i don_'_t know what has changed , i never had this much_trouble before .
neutral	shipping is too expensive !
neutral	much harder to get to the flight selections i want .
neutral	view is too_busy .
neutral	flights are not sorted in a useful order until i make a further selection
neutral	we were disappointed to wait 0_weeks for our items .
neutral	we were told that they would email us 0 to 0 days before delivery to notify us of the delivery date .
neutral	we asked if they could give us an idea if it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
neutral	we were told that they could only do this if we paid £_00 .
neutral	we didn_'_t pay , but onthe day the delivery men rang us to say they would be with us within the hour so we were glad we hadn_'_t paid the extra £_00 .
neutral	the delivery went_smoothly but as someone_else has commented , the amount of packaging we had to remove and dispose of was a pain .
neutral	also in big letters on the packaging it said ' if the packaging cannot be reused the item cannot be returned '.
neutral	so how do you get a sideboard out of a cardboard_box without ripping the box ?
neutral	after over six days i finally received my chihuahua shirt .
neutral	love the shirt but : come on guys , a foot square box filled with blow up cushions for one t - shirt ????
neutral	i don_'_t know who your packaging manager is , but he should pay closer attention to what is going on in his / her department .
neutral	a t - shirt could have gone in an envelope and shipped by mail probably would have been faster and for sure cheaper .
neutral	when i booked online the caption read " pay at check - in " which is one reason i chose the place i did but the money was taken from the account within several hours .
neutral	i had not accounted for this money to be taken out until check - in as quoted .
neutral	it was a bit disappointing because i had several dollars not expected ( major car repair ) and it ran me short on my budget .
neutral	the price of shipping was almost the same as the part i ordered !
neutral	i '_ve ordered a few_times from parts_geek , and while the prices are good , only 0 out of 0 packages i have received were packed with any care whatsoever .
neutral	all but one box had parts literally sticking out of them and there are typically parts that need to be bent back into shape or parts that have dings in them from the poor packaging .
neutral	i '_ve generally been pleased with their work over the past few_years , but the last two times i '_ve been there to swap winter_tires and vice_versa there has_been issues .
neutral	when i got the winter_tires on , they managed to over inflate one tire ( should be 00lbs , was 00 ) and underinflate one ( 00lbs ).
neutral	also , one of hub_caps wasn_'_t even on all the way ( was obviously just hanging off ).
neutral	this most_recent time the tire_pressure was mostly right ( only a pound off ), but the hub_caps were not aligned correctly and were cutting into the stems .
neutral	this is basic qa i would think they would do before calling me and telling_me my car is ready after a simple tire change .
neutral	shipping is way to exspensive and way to long .... drop the post_office and go ups ....
neutral	- although arrived quickly
neutral	- good prices
neutral	- packages in good shape
neutral	- could not contact by phone
neutral	- email contact was not fast
neutral	i received only one box of chargers out of the ten i ordered yet was still charged for all ten .
neutral	i have yet to receive a reply by email .
neutral	edit_:
neutral	they have since got back to me and are shipping the correct amount !
neutral	i decided to try the internet to save some money .
neutral	i live on an island in the pacific northwest .
neutral	most things are
neutral	expensive when buying from a store .
neutral	my break job parts order was broken
neutral	down into 0 shipments .
neutral	after getting my fourth shipment , i am still missing a wheal bearing .
neutral	there is no one to talk to .
neutral	i just filled_out
neutral	a contact " ticket " and i am awaiting a reply .
neutral	i order the wrong rear
neutral	break shoes .
neutral	i need to get an_rma #.
neutral	i need to find out where my
neutral	bearing is to get all four wheels back on the car .
neutral	if i get a good response i may try this again , however , i am leaning toward simply buying locally .
neutral	nearly_impossible to reach ... no phone_number .. you must fill_out a form and wait 00 - 00_hours for a return email .
neutral	bad way to do_business .
neutral	i submitted several pictures to be placed on an album .
neutral	i dis get any response from album that they have received it and that they were ready to print the album .
neutral	the webpage does not have any immediate feedback .
neutral	i bought a liability policy 0_weeks_ago and do not have a policy yet .
neutral	do i get a hard copy policy and when
neutral	thanks
neutral	steve brown
neutral	the downloading of the map is relatively straigtforeward but the help section is fairly useless .
neutral	for example i i had to prepare a plan scale 0 / 000 for a planning application wth 0 buildings on the site . i needed to colour both buildings red and altough i could outline the first building in red i could not alter the blue outline on the second builing .
neutral	it is probably down to my ineptitude but there was no help on the system to point me in the right_direction .
neutral	paid £_00 extra for two man delivery but it was still damaged in transit .
neutral	i sent back 0 pool tables from another supplier and was quite dissapointed to receive another damaged product from this supplier .
neutral	however , as the damage was not as bad , i repaired it myself with additional wood glued on to strengthen the damaged mdf .
neutral	it is only lack of energy that prevented me pursuiing this company at_least for a refund of the £_00 .
neutral	one of the mercedes window cranks i purchased was defective as it is in worse shape that the original one from my 0000 000_sl ( 00 years old ) that i was going to replace .
neutral	product is good .
neutral	prices were comparable to other_sites .
neutral	shipping is horrible .
neutral	it says it could take a week for delivery and it will unless you get expedited_shipping .
neutral	0_stars because i shouldn_'_t have to spend 00 dollars to receive the item in a timely_manner
neutral	could have done better work promised was not finished this is the second year that the interior valeting has not been done .
neutral	may have to look at somwhere else in the future
neutral	allen squires
neutral	the part did not fit my car because of incorrect information from your web_site .
neutral	i am waiting for a response with a rma_number .
neutral	the package it self was really damaged and it not the same as what the picture showed on the website , plus the ground_shipping was 0 dollars which was a lot to me .
neutral	they need get there act_together if they expect to stay alive as a business .
neutral	i went here based on the lowest_price i could find on the internet .
neutral	unfortunately , after signing the contract i learned there was a mandatory $ 0 a month insurance fee .
neutral	this made them more_expensive than other options .
neutral	the facility is clean and the staff was very friendly - i just wish they were more honest in their advertising .
neutral	when i received the part i ordered the box was beat up worse than any box i '_ve ever_seen .
neutral	i '_m not sure if this is partsgeek '_s fault or ups , but i '_m honestly surprised the mirror inside didn_'_t break .
neutral	in some reviews people mentioned they followed he instructions , but mine didn_'_t come with any .
neutral	they did ship quickly and the part was fine .
neutral	i would order again and give them the benefit of the doubt on this one .
neutral	i ordered six dining_chairs on normal delivery and was delighted when they came the next_day at 0 . 00a . m .
neutral	however , on unpacking the chairs all the seats were marked due to being packed in with the legs and bolts and screws needed to assemble the chairs .
neutral	we arranged for the seats only to be sent out and we kept the six backs and all the legs and assembling items .
neutral	we then received another set of six chairs all packaged the same way , some of these were faulty .
neutral	we were disappointed and asked for a full_refund .
neutral	the chairs were promptly collected and full_refund given .
neutral	we were given the opportunity to keep the first set of chairs with a discount of 00_% but did not want to purchase damaged chairs .
neutral	we were given a contact number to call when we were twenty_minutes from the airport to get instructions of where to park but it was on voice_mail .
neutral	we tried again a few_minutes later and same again so left a message .
neutral	as we were getting even closer we had to try again and were answered .
neutral	advised we had left a message and was told not able to get to that !!
neutral	we were then given instructions where to wait for a chauffeur , he was not waiting we waited about eight minutes for him .
neutral	otherwise stress_free .
neutral	the boxes arrived loosely packed , the antenna box was open on both_ends , the tape was not strong_enough for the size box .
neutral	the other was similar in condition , it was a miracle nothing was damaged .
neutral	delievery is good and customer_support fast and reliable .
neutral	couple months_ago me and my friend ordered some cheap offer liquids and all of them was not so good .
neutral	that was mad cow if i remember right .
neutral	now i ordered 00 bottles e_- liquids and there was 0 different_flavours as i ordered .
neutral	that was great .
neutral	now those new liquids ( cranberry , black currant and melon magic ) what i ordered tasted almost same than that mad cow .
neutral	it was like vaping soap .
neutral	i was not surprised that you did not have rate system to those eliquids in your website .
neutral	please , do not sell products what tastes bad and you surely know it .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	instructor was excellent .
neutral	however i feel the course was slightly misrepresented .
neutral	for this course to add any meaningful value you really need to have spent some time with the pmbok and the pmp world before the class .
neutral	pma tells you that you do not need the text or any other prep work before the class - not true .
neutral	if you can at_least watch all the videos on their website and spend some time learning the basics this class will be better for you than someone that walks in cold .
neutral	and it did not work .
neutral	the price and service for the shower i ordered were excellent .
neutral	no_complaints at all .
neutral	however , the shower was faulty when installed .
neutral	on contacting shower_doctor i was told to contact the manufacturer to get them to fix it under_warranty .
neutral	this is a just - out - of - the - box , brand_new , never been used unit .
neutral	as the seller , i would have expected shower_doctor to send a replacement shower and to deal with the manufacturer regarding the faulty shower , which i would have returned to them .
neutral	the service is good but i am having to reboot the modem every week or so .
neutral	there are times when i pick_up the phone to call out and i get a message that " no service available ".
neutral	i just unplug the modem and wait a few seconds and plug it back in .
neutral	it reboots and everything is fine for a week or so .
neutral	when i see that i have a voice_mail message with no caller_id showing i know the modem is lock up and i have no service .
neutral	when i dial * 00 i get the message " no service available ".
neutral	this is becoming an extreme irritation .
neutral	easy to book and pay online , they kept to the schedule and the change of tyres was swift .
neutral	only the confirmation call just before their arrival should be conducted by their despatch operator , as the drivers mobile was really hard to hear .
neutral	not drivers fault at all , but i nearly hanged up , thinking somebody is trying to sell me something over the phone ... :)
neutral	apart_from that , the approach of the technician was very professional , attentive and friendly .
neutral	and i just wonder_how well they do the wheel_balancing .
neutral	my steering_wheel is rather wobbly after the tyre change ...
neutral	a guy told me about this website that sells cd - keys really cheap and had an insanely good deal for metro 0000 which i wanted to buy , so i thought i might aswell get it while i could after i looked up the site on google for confirmation that it was legit .
neutral	it was pretty easy to use but it was so fucking slow , i ordered it at 00 . 00 ( cest ) and i had to wait to the morning after to claim the game just because they didn_'_t confirm my purchase or whatever , otherwise it was good , but that wait time was ridiculous .
neutral	not the worst but we all need improvement , a little less conversation and a little more action !
neutral	but overall not bad .
neutral	it took_forever to get my order .
neutral	in the description , it stated that the radiator was all metal .
neutral	when i received it , i was disappointed to see that the upper and lower tanks were plastic .
neutral	it took some time for hispek to advise that the item was out of stock and took a phone_call for the information .
neutral	ultimately i did get 0 emails apologising for the delay with an ' instock date ' and a delivery date which finally was met .
neutral	i do not yet understand the selling process .
neutral	often i get a response " not enough bullion ' when i try to sell even small fraction of my holding .
neutral	i need to find a tutorial on buying and selling .
neutral	i now understand that the sale of 000 + ounces was completed even_tho was not indicated .
neutral	i am shocked to see that the price i received was $ 0000 . 000 / oz .
neutral	i was entering ~ $ 0000 / oz .
neutral	which was obviously the price range being traded at the time .
neutral	this is a gross error some where .
neutral	please respond .
neutral	please send other transaction data .
neutral	i was a bit miffed to discover afterward actually ordering that bernards_bins is a front for bigdug , however it was also unfortunate that the product i had ordered arrived damaged due to poor manufacturer '_s packaging .
neutral	in addition the guage of metal used was rather thin .
neutral	that said , bernards_bins rose to the challenge and refunded me in full .
neutral	i shall_certainly keep their name in mind for another order sometime in the future should i have a need for an item in their product line .
neutral	very dissapointed in the communication process .
neutral	i never received an_email that my document was ready .
neutral	the first time you couldn_'_t even read the document .
neutral	i am happy with getting it done but really thought they would let_me know when i could get the document from their website .
neutral	i ordered 0 books and i immediately realized that i forgot to pay for upgraded shipping .
neutral	i emailed them about upgrading , there was even a specific email option about upgrading shipping , and when they got back to me they told me no .
neutral	i needed these books for school and they finally arrived 0_weeks_later .
neutral	i did recieve the parts i ordered and so for i '_m pleased with them .
neutral	however i paid_extra for 0 - 0 day shipping and didn_'_t recieve the parts for a week .
neutral	i have repeatedly tried to contact you by phone and have yet to find a way to talk to you about this problem and the extra i spent to recieve the parts quick and when needed like promised .
neutral	it '_s a shame because other than being mislead and charged for something that didn_'_t happen i '_m happy with the parts themselves .
neutral	if this reaches anyone i can be contacted by phone at 000 - 000 - 0000 or e_- mailed here at poppahop0 @_hotmail . com ..... michael happe
neutral	bought a four man tent a few_months_ago and postage fiver .
neutral	bought two small stuff sacks and same price .
neutral	guess i could have gone elsewhere but hey .. everything else ws good
neutral	i ordered two items from ecomfort . com .
neutral	the manufacturer for both items was to be fantech .
neutral	order forms and confirmation confirmed fantech ; but one of the items was manufactured by kb electronics .
neutral	reviews on internet for this product were not as good as that from fantech .
neutral	shared problem with ecomfort and awaiting response and replacement .
neutral	will see if the 0_stars hold - up .
neutral	delivery by fedex was delayed by 0 days due to delivery to wrong_address .
neutral	ecomfort got the label right but fedex got packages mixed up .
neutral	.. we bought one carpet from rug_house via amazon .
neutral	it `_s a nice carpet and we decided , two_days_later , to bought another one ( same colour , some size ) direct from the rug_house direct .
neutral	here the carpet costs only half price and we told the rug_house that we are a bit disappointment .
neutral	the only suggestions was - ` you can return the via amazon ordered one , we will refund it and you order it again direct from us `.. - thats not what we expected
neutral	it was efficient to book .
neutral	no_problems at all , very straightforward on internet .
neutral	however , we had to change the car and there was no response to the emails sent resulting in having to phone .
neutral	this was then sorted_out quickly but inconvenient when emailed to phone when busy with work , domestics and arranging to go on holiday .
neutral	took to long to send torch . did not tell me the problem had to contact them . if you have a problem with a supplier tell people before they buy . good points people frendly good price
neutral	have made many orders with lenstore have always had waste as lens split and cannot be worn
neutral	arrived_promptly but not the colour indicated and email not responded to .
neutral	the selection is good .
neutral	the discounts are frequent .
neutral	the rewards help them stand out from the pack .
neutral	however , we '_ve had buggy issues on the ipad app .
neutral	the android is more stable .
neutral	the desktop website is decent .
neutral	also if the rewards had better redemption values , i ' d never use seamless , but the $ 0 off coupons are awesome and will often dictate my night food plans .
neutral	what a great website .
neutral	these sell the stuff you really want at almost_half the price .
neutral	ordered two identical rear_wheel_hubs for wife '_s camry .
neutral	received two different_brands , which i thought was odd , but they installed the same .
neutral	i thought shipping time was long ( 0 week ).
neutral	time will tell about the quality but so_far ok after 0 days .
neutral	good prices and on phone help and a discout too , but ordered 00 days ago and have not recieved the majority of my order ...
neutral	good place to buy but i get these problems with payment_method and i can '_t buy anymore .
neutral	it '_s says it reserves it for an_hour and that '_s it please fix this
neutral	thanks for the product .
neutral	good selection of products , but the shipping_charges are too high .
neutral	mcm should be more like their sister company newark electronics when it comes to shipping_charges .
neutral	no_problems - quick delivery
neutral	i order three pairs of lift_supports .
neutral	two came no problem .
neutral	the third was reported as shipped .
neutral	a couple of days_later i got an_email_saying that i was being refunded for one order .
neutral	i tried to contact customer_support to no_avail , apparently they have no customer_support .
neutral	i had to wait and see what came and then order the last set from another store , since parts_geek still said they had them in stock , and i did not want to take a chance on that .
neutral	great product .
neutral	oakley_prescription .
neutral	however , when i ordered , the salesperson told me it would take about 0_weeks for delivery .
neutral	not true .
neutral	took more like 0 month .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	my brother put me onto your company having used it in europe .
neutral	he said he had no problem with the car_hire company accepting it and in fact when they had a problem with a minor accident with one of the groups cars the rent a car firm acted promptly and efficiently and said they would deal with you on the insurance .
neutral	i rented my car through travelsupermarket and purchased an argos car_hire quote which was subsequently routed to fox car_hire in the us .
neutral	they made life very difficult in accepting the insurance and made me sign that i had refused their insurance and advised me that if i had any_problems they would not supply a replacement car and that they would not deal with you and that i would have to pay for any repairs / cdw and deal with you which has left me feeling very uncertain .
neutral	generally nice products at good prices although the sizing on one item was incorrect and it had to be returned .
neutral	still_awaiting resolution .
neutral	fast delivery but communication very poor .
neutral	ordered two pocketwizard plux x transmitters / receivers thinking the supplied cables would allow my larger strobe unit ( sunpak auto 000j professional ) to plug right in , or with a cable adapter , work .
neutral	unfortunately , pocketwizard doesn_'_t supply a cable that would allow my male pc cord on the sunpak flash to plug into the pw plus x directly .
neutral	the cord supplied with the pw has a male pc end .
neutral	so i have two devices with male pc ends , and pw doesn_'_t supply an adapter ...
neutral	i know for a fact that many older flash units have male pc sync cords , and there fore wouldn_'_t work with the pw system at all , without buying yet another product .
neutral	so as i '_m shopping your website , i go through over 00 + pages of pc sync cables , and no where , is the option for a simple , female - to - female pc cable anywhere .
neutral	it could have been one inch long , it would have worked ...
neutral	you have a diverse_selection of hotshoe adapters , yet that serves a purpose i don_'_t need .
neutral	the sunpak 000j is a very powerful and professional strobe , yet the almighty b_&_h doesn_'_t carry simple adapter cords ?
neutral	very disappointing , and why give 00 + pages that don_'_t match what i typed in the search ?
neutral	i '_ve bought everything from my nikon_d0000 to my latest d0 and d000 ...
neutral	i '_ve given so very much money to this company , and cannot find a simple cable ...
neutral	great choice of product with good prices and delivery .
neutral	however i was not happy with the way i was called and rather confusingly was offered extended_warranty insurance , i dually cancelled this unwanted insurance but when i returned to buy another product i received a letter thanking_me for taking out extended insurance_cover which i never asked for , so i had to cancel again .
neutral	all in all good company to deal with but they need to evaluate the way they approach selling extended cover as unfortuanatly it leaves a bad_taste
neutral	the strap used to tighten the cover to the seat was advertised as sewn in , they are , just not well .
neutral	the strap broke easily during_installation .
neutral	didn_'_t even get to the tightening down part yet .
neutral	i was just trying to get the slack out and untwist it .
neutral	they do look good and the pockets are handy .
neutral	shipping was quick .
neutral	wow !
neutral	customer service called me today .
neutral	three_days after original review .
neutral	i never called them with my problem .
neutral	they do read these reviews !!
neutral	they offered to send me out a new cover to replace the one that broke during_installation .
neutral	no_hassle of me having to send mine back .
neutral	i am very impressed with 0wheel_drive hardware .
neutral	i will not_hesitate to shop with them again .
neutral	the air_conditioner should be checked and improved .
neutral	the gps can be updated , to better performance .
neutral	concern about so called " paper jam " when using inkfarm vs hp . had to restart connection as if new start up between computer to copier via disc in order to receive copies from computer . message continues to show up which i delete - this step did not work first use of inkfarm , had to do disc start up .
neutral	i ordered star craft 0 wings of liberty from cjs recently .
neutral	before purchasing the game i was under the impression it would be almost_instant ( once i had been verified .)
neutral	unfortunately to my woe i was presented with a screen explaining it would be up to 00_hrs until the automatic key system would have more keys to offer .
neutral	i easily swallowed that and even waited 00_hrs ... still ... no love .
neutral	as you can imagine by this point i am becoming a little frustrated .
neutral	long_story short , after_contacting support and being given a cursory " the supplier is being slower_than usual , but they will come soon " reply .
neutral	i waited for another 0 or 0 days before i received the key .
neutral	i ' d like to say this was a once off , but on the same thing happened when they released diablo_iii and the website stated " available for instant download "
neutral	i intend to give cjs another go , however if i am met with such appalling service again , i will just pay the extra money and buy it from a shop .
neutral	parts_geeks have true to the core parts and greats prices .
neutral	cheaper_than rock_auto .
neutral	the only problem is returning parts is a long process .
neutral	work on that and then i '_ll gave you guys 0_stars
neutral	i ordered a shave kit from this website .
neutral	it took two_weeks for the item to get to me .
neutral	fed_ex deemed my packaged received and it wasn_'_t .
neutral	i called both fed_ex and west_coast shaving about the issue .
neutral	the rep from west_coast shaving said they would contact fed_ex and then get back to me when they had a resolution .
neutral	they never got back to me .
neutral	i dealt directly with fed_ex until i resolved the issue and got my package .
neutral	on this order i got the confirmation e_-_mail rite_away instead of 00_hrs .
neutral	later on a previous which caused me to do a duplicate order !!
neutral	!
neutral	i had ordered an idler_pulley for a mercedes class vehicle .
neutral	i paid_extra for 0 day shipping because my wife was going out of town .
neutral	the part was shipped on time .
neutral	it was just the wrong part .
neutral	the part that your business sent for my car was a sensor for a honda .
neutral	i replied back about the problem .
neutral	your business gave_me a return merchandise number and said the package would be picked_up and you would credit my acct .
neutral	the part is still sitting at the house waiting to be picked_up and my acct had not been credited .
neutral	i would like to talk to someone just to make_sure this closure happens .
neutral	thanks
neutral	donnie newman
neutral	i ordered some mepilex border lite with the intent of covering a new healed skin area .
neutral	the dimensions for the item were 0 " by 0 ".
neutral	when i received them the outside dimension was the 0 " by 0 " including the adhesive border .
neutral	i was coceerned it was too small , but it does cover and protect my new skin surprisingly .
neutral	there was no technical help to see if the part i ordered was complete .
neutral	all i got was a reply 0 days_later with a response that basically said i could return it .
neutral	with all of the fanfare about who has the best deals on hotel_rooms it is usually a draw .
neutral	seldom is there more than a dollar or two difference_between the different companies giving out quotes .
neutral	things like cancellation_policy usually is the deciding_factor for me .
neutral	most of the order was correct , but despite ticking their shipment sheet to say an item was correct it was actually the wrong_colour and size .
neutral	no free_postage returns system either .
neutral	i googled hampton_inn / auburn to make a reservation which apparently led me to expedia , which the reservationist never identified himself as being with expedia .
neutral	the resulting reservation was $_00 more than i had paid at the same hotel 0_weeks earlier , but the person taking the reservation said it must be because it was a sat .
neutral	night .
neutral	when i arrived at the hotel they had the reservation , but that is when i found out it was not made directly with the hotel , but rather with a third_party .
neutral	on top of paying more , i was also not able to enter my hilton_honors points because the reservation was made thru a third_party .
neutral	i really feel_like i was duped and should have been told to whom i was speaking on the telephone .
neutral	i now know why the reservationist said the reservation was non cancellable , which is not the usual hilton policy .
neutral	i got one thing that i wanted but what i really wanted was the total_primate care which was and is still out of stock .
neutral	whatsup with that ?
neutral	very happy with purchase , but it was unfortunately sent to the billing_address , rather_than to the alternate address i had requested .
neutral	delivery took much longer_than usual !
neutral	i wish there were more show options .
neutral	i also don_'_t like seeing the same or more discounts on other_websites or programs .
neutral	ordering these filters will save you money if you can_afford to order at_least six of each size that your furnace / a /_c uses .
neutral	delivery time most be based on how far away from the seller you are .
neutral	our example as first time buyers was 00 days after tracking said the filters were shipped .
neutral	we also had to go to the post_office to pick_up the box as fedex deliver '_s to the post_office not to our home . that real stinks based on the shipping charge of almost twenty_dollars from i believe the orlando , fl .
neutral	area to central tennessee .
neutral	a good friend gave_us the tip about ordering these filters but did mention they are delivered by camel , i thought they where kidding , not .
neutral	i always find myself going back to amazon becouse there prices are so good , however i have had several bad_experiences while buying from resellers that are allowed to advertise on there site , with one delivery taking two_weeks to arrive , the real sting in the tail was that the hd - dvd went bust a couple of weeks_later
neutral	when i first sent in my device , i was shocked at how quickly it arrived and ended_up cued up for assessment .
neutral	then radio silence - and after i week , i called to figure_out what was going on because the status said " assessing claim ."
neutral	they were super nice on the phone , and very helpful , but they didn_'_t have any additional info to provide .
neutral	then , zoom - product was fixed and back in my hands .
neutral	so , if communication about that middle step was better , i ' d give them a higher rating , but i '_m still very satisfied .
neutral	i like oakley style , so i found frames i liked and thought i could get them for my prescription ( clear ).
neutral	i had hassles with mall retailers so i went to framesdirect .
neutral	they had no problem with my prescription as submitted , and i thought i was good .
neutral	usps failed to deliver the package to zip_code 00000 for over nine_days .
neutral	they had the package , they just refused to ship it .
neutral	they claimed to have left a note but no note was ever located ; moreover , they did not re - ship until i called .
neutral	the unfortunate fact here is that delivery is part of any shopping_experience , and while i can '_t fault framesdirect for a usps malfunction , i will question their choice of shipper .
neutral	the frames arrived and look great .
neutral	however , the prescription is wrong .
neutral	so , i '_m not sure if they were cut wrong or if the eye_doctor is wrong .
neutral	i '_ll look into it .
neutral	but , assuming it '_s not framesdirect at fault , i ' d definitely use them again .
neutral	great product , excellent delivery time ..
neutral	the drawback was that shipping was almost as expensive as the product .
neutral	actual shipping_costs by the post_office were probably less_than $ 0 , first_class , in a small envelope .
neutral	my order was ( 00 ) plastic connectors .
neutral	yet i was charged $ 0 . 00 for shipping on a $ 0 . 00 order .
neutral	a bit much .
neutral	i order many things off the internet .
neutral	my order weighted less_than 0 lbs and it took a week to get to me .
neutral	most items of this size i order take 0 to 0 days .
neutral	i was just disappointed .
neutral	bought sab frame and was surprised to find no info - did not know what headset to get and when i asked for help was told " standard 00 00 " which when i went to purchase was not much help .
neutral	would have been great if merlin gave the option to have the headset fitted at a cost like [_link ] do .
neutral	am now waiting for my local bike shop to get the right headset which will take about a week - frustrating !
neutral	the auto_europe part was fine - we asked for an econo ford_focus .
neutral	however we were persuaded by the rental company to upgrade to a car with built - in gps on the grounds that the portable kind enticed thieves to break into the vehicle .
neutral	the upgrade with built in gps turned_out to be a mercedes_benz and the additional_cost ($_000 for the 00 days ) greatly exceeded what we had pre_- paid auto_europe for the basic rental ($_000 ).
neutral	of course we got a super car and classy sat .
neutral	nav .
neutral	so cant really complain , and no one cheated us , we were just rather innocent .
neutral	in retrospect , a ford_focus with portable gps would have done us ok ( to say nothing of costing less for fuel ).
neutral	ordered a replacement door mirror and when it arrived , the box was totally beat and taped up all around .
neutral	there were no foam peanuts or packing_material inside .
neutral	fortunately , the mirror was not broken .
neutral	service was great .
neutral	but there a new guy at the register i didn_'_t realize until after i go home that i didn_'_t get the ongoing deal / sale on the oil_change .
neutral	it '_s usually $_00 i think .
neutral	but next time i '_ll remember to bring the coupon ( s ).
neutral	i had sent a question to their customer service department on 00 / 00 / 0000 , and i have yet to receive an answer .
neutral	pleased with the product , but would like to courtesy of a response .
neutral	this was what i sent them :
neutral	hey folks - i just received the pair of bi_- focal safety glasses that i ordered from frames_direct ... and i have to say i am extremely_satisfied .
neutral	they are awesome , as billed , and i can see great .
neutral	i have a couple of pairs of frames that i ' d like to get new lenses put in .
neutral	can i send you my current lenses so you can copy their perimeter profile .
neutral	i can install the lenses in the frames when they arrive - no problem .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	frames_direct , if you ' re reading these , please respond to my original e_-_mail .
neutral	i had this site recommended to me by my daughter .
neutral	it took a little while to get used to it and i think the scanning software or side of it could be easier to use .
neutral	my daughter nor i could get it to work .
neutral	i ordered a hydronic towel heater and the product arrived rather quickly , however , the valves that i ordered were wrong .
neutral	i had ordered angled valves but straight valves arrived .
neutral	so i called customer_support and was asked to send pictures of my valves as they thought they had sent me the correct valves - an excellent customer experience would have been if the representative would have apologized for sending the wrong valves and immediately sent the correct ones .
neutral	but in my case i had to prove that a mistake was made .
neutral	the representative unfortunately gave_me an incorrect email address so i was unable to send him the images of the incorrect valves so i had to start the process over .
neutral	in the course of a few more email interactions finally the correct valves were sent to me but whereas the original product arrived within a few_days , it took almost a month for the valves to arrive ( granted , the christmas_holidays were in between so that certainly caused a bit of a delay ).
neutral	so all in all , the product is good and in the end the correct valves were sent , unfortunately the process was just harder that it should have been therefore the 0_star_rating .
neutral	i like these jerseys .
neutral	they are a good price and it is nice to make custom jerseys for our group .
neutral	however , be aware that the sizing of the jerseys runs extremely small .
neutral	one of our group according to the size_chart should have worn a large .
neutral	he ordered an extra large and it still didn_'_t fit .
neutral	have purchased two pair of speedo water exercise gloves and really like the way they fit and the amount of resistence they provide .
neutral	problem is that within 0 months both pair have totally fallen apart .
neutral	it appears they do not stand - up well to chlorine .
neutral	rinse them after every water exercise class .
neutral	i have a speedo resistent belt that is wearing very well and an excellent product .
neutral	i wasted a lot of time trying to figure_out how to us a discount_code .
neutral	tli sent email to support but they could not help me .
neutral	i ordered a centerlink for my 0000_gmc sonoma sls , x vin .
neutral	it came in a moog carton but wasn_'_t moog , it didn_'_t fit my vehicle , and it didn_'_t even look like the picture on the website .
neutral	i '_ve got an_rma already , but they don_'_t seem very helpful , or interested , in helping_me order the correct part .
neutral	if this turns_out to be a big hassle , i will make_sure to only order parts online from a place that has a phone_number where you can talk to a live_person should the need_arise .
neutral	kt takes 0 or 0 days to even get an_email response , in this day and age !!
neutral	!
neutral	fast delivery , but end fax was extremely dark w_/ crosshatching across all white areas
neutral	the service seems to work ok so_far , but i received very poor support when setting_up the service and it was not working .
neutral	the person i spoke with knew little about networking and gave_me misinformation about what could be the cause of the failure .
neutral	fortunately i knew more than he did and ended_up solving the problem myself simply by power cycling the device .
neutral	i am suspicious that a purposeful attempt has_been made to delay the availability of funds .
neutral	received the basics of the tank level monitor system .
neutral	two_sets of the service notices but no installation_instructions .
neutral	had to find those online
neutral	i should have bought a new car cover sooner for my porshe 000 ---- 0000 but with only 00000_miles from new -- as the old one was showing its age .
neutral	after looking at the sites on the internet i decided on the ultimate finish and phoned the office to order one .
neutral	i prefer to speak to the seller rather_than order online , so i can ask questions that arise .
neutral	sarah was very helpful and i duly placed my order .
neutral	the delivery day via_ups was uncertain and i couldn_'_t follow delivery through via the identity number , and when it arrived there was no invoice attached , or receipt , which was puzzling .
neutral	i did a lot of price and quality research before selecting lensfactory .
neutral	i have a high - power prescription and prefer progressive_lenses , so i typically pay a premium to lighten the weight of the lenses .
neutral	lensfactory was able to provide this at a significantly_lower cost than any other lens provider that i found and i found the lens quality to be competitive .
neutral	doing without my glasses for almost 0_weeks ( i had a spare pair ) was more bearable because of the better pricing .
neutral	i believe lensfactory could have done a better job in letting_me know that they received my glasses and the progress they were making in fulfilling my order .
neutral	additionally , my frames came back to me needing adjustments to fit comfortably .... the left arm was bent slightly , the earpiece tip bent / broke and the nose_pads out of alignment .
neutral	if not for problem with the frame i would have given lensfactory at_least 0_stars .
neutral	unless there the only place you can find a part you ' d be better off going to your local parts house , i ordered a caliper for my sierra denali and the part was cheap but the core_charge and shipping cost more than the part .
neutral	it took a week for it to get here and it did fit for which i '_m thankful because the websites customer service page says " if we screw up , its on you " pretty_much .
neutral	they don_'_t pay for return shipping on the core and you have to get a service ticket to return the core .
neutral	so if its a part you really need and don_'_t mind waiting a week and there the only place you can find it , go for it otherwise go to a parts house .
neutral	you won_'_t beat the price of parts anywhere_else , and the parts were expedited and delved in a timely_manner , unfortunately there is a no return_policy , and if you so happen to receive a part that is the wrong part your are kind of out luck .
neutral	my daily driver a jaguar 0 . 0 needed a new cooling_system i received a thermostat housing and gasket and water distribution pipe all on time and fitted well but the thermostat they listed for a 0 . 0 was not the correct piece and consequently i had to run to the local parts store to buy the correct sized thermostat .
neutral	now i have a part i don_'_t need sitting in my trunk and also i think the thermostat was refurbished because when it came in it had water spots and a but of rust , also the thermostat housing assembly was brand_new and had been machined but had some spots in the carvings that were not fully cleared away and could have caused major damage had i not knocked the pieces clear .
neutral	overall the did well but hey not everybody is perfect .
neutral	i ordered a new sleeping_bag , its so new it isn_'_t in stock yet
neutral	was in a hurry , and my fault completely , i booked through reservation_counter .
neutral	after i paid , i realized the mistake i made .
neutral	was still hopeful as they said they ' d send me a confirmation number within 0 - 0 hours .
neutral	unfortunately , i did not get the confirmation_email at all .
neutral	i got an_email with an itinerary , but no follow_up email as they said should arrive .
neutral	the day of our stay , the hotel still had no_idea we were going to be arriving .
neutral	i called customer_support , and all the guy did was boo the hotel though expedia . com !
neutral	i could have done that and had much less trouble .
neutral	oh , and i couldn_'_t use my marriott reward card either .
neutral	overall , not a bad_experience , but , i have a feeling all i did was pay for them to book at expedia . com .
neutral	they ' re not bbb accredited , so to anyone_else who plans on using reservation_counter , i would not make them your first choice .
neutral	my instructions seem tto be constantly overlooked depite being made perfectly clear .
neutral	when converting sterling into euro the rate you have offered me today is 0 . 0000 whereas currencies_direct offered me an exchange_rate of 0 . 00 without the £_00 transaction fee .
neutral	when we arrived at the car_rental office in manchester , england , the only car_rental_desk with a waiting line was autoeurope .
neutral	the line proceeded to get longer and longer .
neutral	it was said that there was a " computer problem ".
neutral	my reservation was for 00 :_00am .
neutral	i arrived at 00 :_00am in line .
neutral	because of that , i was told i was " too early and my car was not ready ".
neutral	due to that , i had to upgrade in order to get a car at that time .
neutral	i paid an_additional 00 english pounds .
neutral	my check out time was 00 :_00am , well within the hour_window .
neutral	i have used autoeurope in other_countries and this was probably the most problematic experience .
neutral	i had to send the item back it showed_up damaged , we refused it from ups
neutral	when will i recieve the new part ?
neutral	casa uma .
neutral	we found the villa very comfortable and clean .
neutral	the maid was very thorough in this aspect . the kitchen would benefit to be re - furnished and the t . v .
neutral	needs to be replaced .
neutral	more umbrellas are needed around the pool area . a car is essential to visitors using casa uma as it is in a very quiet rural_area .
neutral	regards .
neutral	the hodgson family .
neutral	the rental_car was clean and serviced .
neutral	however , there was no one associated with the rental_agency available to help me familiarize myself with the various controls of the car .
neutral	there seemed to be more interest in whether or not i wanted to upgrade ... if i wanted to pay to activate the sat - nav system , etc .
neutral	there was no_hassle turning the car back in .
neutral	nice directory , but it is not much trustworthy .
neutral	found some people that i know , who entered completely false_information .
neutral	good overall , but prices are sometimes way too off .
neutral	quality of clothes is good however .
neutral	good , but way too expensive .
neutral	i look_elsewhere for free music .
neutral	the service at your rental place in amsterdam ( trifty ) was horrible .
neutral	they gave_us a ship - stupid car as an equivalent ; they did not have rental gps , no maps or information literature about the country .
neutral	they were rude .
neutral	we were oriented by the gas_station next to them .
neutral	the prices are wonderful but the website experience isn_'_t exactly intuitive .
neutral	each page along the ordering_process is filled with thousands of words of complicated legal disclaimers and if you overlook one thing then make a change 00 seconds later , bookit charges you a $_00 cancellation_fee .
neutral	after 00_minutes on the phone i did get that fee waived .
neutral	i ' d prefer a simpler interface with very clear information .
neutral	the fine_print is a red_flag that makes the buyer fear theirs a hidden gotcha .
neutral	overall it was positive and the pricing was great .
neutral	part is slightly off but it worked eventually .
neutral	no problem with the service and the price was good .
neutral	£_00 ocado_voucher promised within 00_hours of delivery but still not arrived after nearly a week .
neutral	i '_m beginning to suspect a con !
neutral	the price quoted on the website for 00 g0 halogen bulbs " from £_00 . 00 " is misleading .
neutral	the price for 0 pack of 00 is actually £_00 . 00 + " standard delivery " £ 0 . 00 + 00_% vat = £_00 . 00 .
neutral	the website could indicate earlier that the prices exclude vat and that the delivery charge is significant .
neutral	the correct product was delivered in a timely_fashion but the carrier left the package outside our house when we were out - a practice which i dislike .
neutral	next time i will try a competitor .
neutral	safe was delivered in great condition but truck driver called me and said he couldn_'_t get that large a truck to my house .
neutral	i had to meet him at a suitable location and he put the safe on my pickup .
neutral	when i got it to my house .
neutral	i had to get ' muscle ' to off load it .
neutral	your website should talk about this scenario because i expected them to deliver it to my curbside .
neutral	tony zembrodt
neutral	application process was clunky and impersonal
neutral	everything_went fine - until i tried to print , then no printy !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a downpipe for my 0000_audi_a0 quattro .
neutral	the bracket to hang it from under my car was welded in the wrong place .
neutral	i had to remove it with a dremel and re welded on the right place
neutral	i received a reminder from multitrip to renew our travel_insurance .
neutral	i did just that for my wife and i ( annual multitrip cover including u . s . a .).
neutral	this was at a very good rate .
neutral	however when i was referred for the medical review , my application was refused .
neutral	this was very disappointing as i was accepted last_year and there is no change in my health condition , except for being one year older .
neutral	also , as i had been charged for the basic cover before the medical review i had to request a refund from multitrip .
neutral	it would be better if the medical element was carried_out before the basic element was charged thus saving time , money and the nuisance of requesting a refund .

positive	what more can you want except a huge_range and they have that covered as well
positive	this is a great site easy to use an great layout plus there are pleny of different_brands to choose from !
positive	i would recommend supplement wearhouse to anyone trying to buy supplements because they have the cheapest prices out there .
positive	they may have high shipping prices but it is worth it with how good of deals you receive .
positive	not to mention them matching competitors prices and even going 0 % lower .
positive	we got exactly_what they promised us , good service without_any_problems .

positive	the online followup was excellent - i particularly_liked that they gave a named customer service advisor in case of difficulty .
positive	the local fitting_centre completed the job within the timescale notified on the website , and provided comfortable seating for the wait !
positive	i '_ll be using blackcircles again .
positive	outstandingly good website and speed of delivery just as good .
positive	i have just bought quite a few things from simply_scuba to replace my mostly 00 year_old equipment and give this company a very good rating .
positive	just slightly slow in dealing_with returns but you can feel very confident that they will sort all .
positive	i purchased a diamond_engagement_ring , and two wedding_bands , in january_0000 .
positive	anthony and others i spoke to at brilliance were great in helping_me choose the right diamond .
positive	the rings are beautiful and shipped quickly .
positive	we '_ve had them independently appraised at higher_than the purchase price .
positive	thanks , brilliance .
positive	the website was easy to use , even for a man !
positive	the service throughout has_been excellent - this is my second order , and the goods are exactly as expected , probably even better_than_expected !
positive	i ordered a cb_radio and antenna ... with so many choices the detailed_descriptions and reviews on the web_site made my choice much_easier and i could not be_happier .
positive	the price was lower_than other_sites when you consider the equipment came complete in a package with no need to purchase other support items not included with the radio on other_sites .
positive	my order arrived as_promised and one of the knobs was broken ... over the course of the weekend ... a holiday_weekend at that ... we were able to report the problem and right_channel made immediate arrangements to have a replacement knob mailed to us directly from the manufacturer .
positive	problems will sometimes occur despite the best of efforts ... it is nice to know a company will stand_behind what they sell ... at anytime , not just when it suits them !
positive	having used shopto for a while now among other_sites i can safely say it is the top of the lot , out of 0 i use it is the best value on new products , deals and bundles , and among the best for preorders ; concerning arrival time , bonuses and price guarantee .
positive	there is a wide_range of products that are usually a hassle to sort through on other_sites , accessories and peripherals that usually you ' d not find unpess you were specifically looking for them , i can only hope that in the future the range on these increases further , getting new and upcoming electronics .
positive	customers service always shines through for me with this site , as is the way with alot of sites making you feel_like nothing more than a wallet with automated_responses after a day or two then a link to faqs this isn_'_t the case with shopto , both_times i '_ve had queries it has_been met quickly and by a person_who understands the problem and does what they can to fix it .
positive	never left wanting .
positive	as long as i keep playing games i '_ll always be shopping at shopto for better deals and easy service and do recommend it to friends and fellow gamers alike .
positive	the top was delivered very quickly , and of course delivery is free , which is always a nice bonus .
positive	the top is great quality , very comfortable and a very nice design .
positive	all in all a 0_star service , thank_you superdry .
positive	i bought one pair , and then a second of mountain_equipment stretch pants .
positive	now the service was great , speedy_delivery and i was kept_updated right through the process , from the checkout to the door .
positive	the stretch pants arn '_t the normal ones that me produces and everyone has reviewed .
positive	t . o . s never mentioned this on the website , but other than the minor_niggle of no back pocket , me have addressed all the issues that reviews have highlighted .
positive	there is a gusset behind the zip at the bottom of the leg on the pants ( this is missing on the normal ones , it '_s just a zip )
positive	the one thigh pocket that doesn_'_t get used on close fitting trousers like these has_been replaced by two zips , one on each leg , behind which is a mesh panel for venting .
positive	so these pants are now more versatile as you can now cool the legs down .
positive	the trade off though is no back pocket .
positive	i miss the back pocket .
positive	but after buying one pair i decided that the greater versatility was worth losing a back pocket for , so i bought a second_pair .
positive	hopefully me will go forward with this design in the autumn , but with a back pocket ;)
positive	best_wishes

positive	we determined that we needed a flight case for our 00 - inch imac on a tuesday_afternoon arizona - time ( about 0 :_00pm in maidstone , kent ) and we were able to reach a representative via chat to answer a few questions that we had .
positive	we ordered that evening and had the case on friday_morning for a weekend trade show .
positive	my only problem thus_far is that i need to create an instruction_sheet for how to put the computer into the case correctly .
positive	the tsa screeners at the airport do not put the computer back in place properly so the panel separating the lower storage compartment does not stay in place and the contents of the compartment shift .
positive	simple to set_up , easy to use .
positive	faultless service and a great online tool for sending and collecting money .

positive	so buy confidently we did and have no_regrets thank_you
positive	i felt as though boiler_juice genuinely wanted to save me money not only did their quote beat all independent companies , when they delivered it was even cheaper again because they had grouped me in with other deliveries in my area giving me the benefit of an even cheaper rate per_litre , and the ironic thing was that the company that delivered was one i had asked a quote from and was way dearer .
positive	really felt that had my financial interests at heart i also like to keep a eye on oil prices and regulate my deliveries when oil prices have dropped , watching boiler_juice has helped_me to do this , delivery was prompt , and delivery man was helpful and friendly , big smiles all_round in this house as boiler_juice contacted me to say they had managed to shave a bit more off the price and i could either leave the money in an account with them or have it returned to my card .
positive	i advise friends if they are serious about watching the pounds then visit boiler_juice as they can help you help yourself .

positive	neworleans . com is the " end all , be all " for all my new_orleans travel .
positive	i drove 000_miles round_trip to pick_up my bees today .

positive	i felt very good about my purchase .
positive	bought the mechanical clutch linkage for a 00 cj .
positive	i really did not need the bell crank , probably the most expensive part but i could not figure_out how to split out what i actually needed on the website .
positive	the " kit " came as individual parts in plastic envelopes .
positive	there is an exploded parts drawing but it was not labeled , at_least in a way that i could understand so i gave up and ordered the whole thing including stuff that i did not need .
positive	fast , easy , knowledgable service .

positive	i cant recommend this site enough to people who wish to buy games online .
positive	i often find the games cheaper_than anywhere_else and far cheaper_than the high_street .
positive	the web_site is bright , colourful and easy to get round , and if you are struggling to find what you want there is a search bar at the top of the screen .
positive	ive never had a late delivery .
positive	my games have always arived on time or before_release .
positive	they even tell you if the price of the game has come down in price if you have pre ordered it .
positive	all in all the service i have had is fantastic and cant recommecnt this site enough .
positive	it is always working , very good , trustworthy , fast moneytransfer .
positive	i am really satisfied with the service ....
positive	i have purchased photo_paper , inks and lenses from this company .

positive	so_far , no_hitches at all .
positive	orders are processed quickly , the staff has a wonderful mix of professionalism and kindness .
positive	their payment system is a breath of fresh_air in an ever dangerous world of thievery .
positive	i find their attention to detail and security a large value added to their already great prices .
positive	great selection , reasonable prices and very fast shipping .
positive	ordered twice from partsgeek and everything was in order .
positive	will_defiantly do_business again
positive	i was looking for some uncommon stainless_steel blots and they had everything in stock and i received them faster then i expected .
positive	great job and i be using them again .
positive	the website was easy , and delivery was here almost before i logged off , altogether amazing service
positive	after wrecking the side wall of my michelin pro0 service tyre with a bit of a altercation on a descent , i had to revert back to my conti gator skins ( very good tyres ), i noticed that they don_'_t roll as well and feel hard sending road vibration up trough the bike .
positive	i decided to try the vittoria tyres , these are excellent i have done a couple of crit races , hill climbs and a bunch of distance rides , they perform brilliantly in all applications , possibly not quite as soft as the pro0 '_s .
positive	also , price , service and speedy_delivery to australia was very good .
positive	i wasn_'_t sure about what to choose from two different road wheels , so after a couple of quickly replied emails a decision was made and i went with the stores recommendations and was very happy with purchase .
positive	the wheels only just turned_up at the max given which was a little unfortunate but can '_t be helped .
positive	the fog_lights worked as listed ..... very satisfied and would use parts_geek again .
positive	this was the first order that i have placed with sinister_diesel .
positive	i ordered a coolant filtration_system for my powerstroke and the staff answered all of my questions very thoroughly about the product .
positive	ive ordered many aftermarket parts from many vendors , & sinister has_been the friendliest to deal with !
positive	definitely have my repeat_business !
positive	simple order of pen_refills , delivered next_day and a free marker included !
positive	can '_t ask for more .
positive	prices seemed good so didn_'_t shop around .
positive	pleased to find the site .
positive	they provide a good fast service but you pay for it as their service fee is pretty high .
positive	parts_geek has always provided excellent products .
positive	the products are exactly as they describe them .
positive	it is easy to surf their website to find what you want .
positive	their prices are very hard to beat .
positive	parts are always well_packaged and arrive in a very timely_manner .
positive	parts_geek has never let_me down .
positive	i always get the part i requested .
positive	i will_continue to buy from parts_geek .
positive	thank_you for being in business .
positive	use merlons as much as the other two sites i use .
positive	good service and good prices . i will always use them as long as i can ride .
positive	as ever merlin_cycles provide one of the best services around .
positive	best price and order arrived next_day ( unlike_some other bigger online stores you would have to wait for a week !
positive	).
positive	never did this before .
positive	u tube got me started .
positive	replacing he first strut took an_hour .
positive	the other three took less_than an_hour .
positive	it helps knowing what to do .
positive	i find western_bikeworks often has the best prices on the web .
positive	their specials are unbeatable , coupons are combinable , selection is great , shipping is normally free on orders over $_00 .
positive	give western_bikeworks a try today , you won_'_t regret it .....
positive	the reception lady was very friendly and organised .
positive	offered ( expensive ) tea / coffee from the vending machine .
positive	comfy seats , spacious waiting room with a window on the workshop , lots of ( car ) magazines to read .
positive	workshop supervisor knew how to start my car too , so lots of experience !
positive	i had flagged wear on the outside corners to the website , but this did not appear to be acknowledged in any way , so i spoke to the receptionist about it and the workshop supervisor took it on board .
positive	in the event , he said the tracking was good , but the old tyres were probably underinflated , which had caused the edge wear .
positive	the new tyres , falken ze000 recommended by blackcircle , are not run - in yet and so don_'_t feel very grippy , even compared to the 0mm - remaining dunlop sp000 oem boots .
positive	placed order on a bank_holiday , had a couple of questions and wanted to add to the order .
positive	was surprised they were open and everything sorted in a very friendly and personal way .
positive	will now not use anyone_else !
positive	was surprised at how quickly i received the order and all was as ordered .
positive	the sirts turned_out just right and the artwork is excellent .
positive	so much to choose from , so much information .
positive	i was impressed from the moment l ordered the parts .
positive	went like_clockwork .
positive	would highly reccoment to anybody want to deal with you .

positive	got here right when they said it would .
positive	highly reommended .
positive	will not order from anywhere_else .
positive	b_&_h is my go to place for camera supplies and sometimes other electronics too .
positive	prices are keen , shipping is often free for smaller stuff and no tax for me .
positive	they have everything that i am looking for and they offer so many free_samples so i can evaluate before buying .
positive	in fact this is my second order and i am buying things that i got as samples in my first order .
positive	i would have never tried them otherwise .
positive	they were excellent quality .
positive	i buy a lot of stuff online but have never had as good experience as i have with supplement_warehouse .
positive	eiffel_tower website had no more tickets available for our dates , but fat_tire did !
positive	yay
positive	i deal with quite a few online companies but doheny outshines them all .
positive	they achieve this by having the best customer service , prices and shipping .
positive	i have found it very hard to find an on line business as good in comparision with doheny .
positive	enough said just an all out great shopping experiance .
positive	i found exactly_what i needed at the best prices around .... i checked everywhere .
positive	very quick and easy , delivery options were fantastic .... coming from a john_lewis employee this is high praise indeed !
positive	will use dolphin again & again .
positive	i was told of this website from a friend and when i looked on the website and the amazing prices .

positive	i found cultpens on google and thought they really looked like pen experts - i had made a mistake buying cheap refills from ebay before and thought ' not again !'
positive	these_guys are great and their service is superb .
positive	my order was processed without_any fuss and my refills dropped on my doormat about 0 days_later , well ahead of when i expected them to arrive .

positive	really nice_touch though and i will_definitely use cultpens again .
positive	thank_you very much !
positive	i looked at a few sites for memory for my toshiba_laptop and mr_memory was one of the few that actually listed my model .
positive	the price was also better_than others so i felt_confident in ordering .
positive	the memory arrived within a couple of days and was easy to fit with the helpful video lesson .
positive	i can recommend mr_memory with no reservations .
positive	this is the second time i '_ve used boilerjuice for a delivery and the system works very well .
positive	i always get a number of quotes and this time boilerjuice was again the cheapest , provided i paid by debit_card .
positive	the delivery came well within the quoted period and was from one of the companies who ' d quoted me .
positive	the previous time i ordered oil boilerjuice wasn_'_t the cheapest so i will_continue to ring round for quotes .
positive	the service is also useful for the regular e_-_mails which keep me in touch with general oil price trends .
positive	after all the normal shopping around skyparksecure where the best price ( by at_least the price of a couple of beers in the airport ).
positive	the booking system was straightforward and got the manchester t0 multistorey for 00 days for not a lot more than any of the long stay options .
positive	as a plus there '_s no credit_card surcharge .
positive	i ordered a muffler from them .
positive	muffler was shipped .
positive	muffler arrived .
positive	no_issues ... that just about covers it .
positive	the bolt_depot website makes it super easy to find even the most obscure fasteners .
positive	the company also supports non profit organizations such as the geek group , helping to inspire makers of all ages !
positive	bolt_depot will always be my source for any kind of fastener !

positive	i have just started the cla tabs so we shall see if these are just as good , i hope they are .
positive	i ordered a edwin_jagger double_edge razor .
positive	i haven_'_t shaved with a double edged razor for years .
positive	my previous one was an old safety_razor , gillette i think circa 0000s that i used for years and could adjust the blade height and angle on .
positive	the jagger is straight to the point , no_frills , and unable to be adjusted .
positive	initially , i was a bit_concerned .
positive	however , i popped in a blade , lathered up very well , and went to it .
positive	i could tell as soon as the blade hit my face that the blade was sharp and the angle perfect .
positive	i got a fantastic extremely close shave with not a knick or cut .
positive	i '_m very impressed ; my face is almost as smooth as my girlfriend '_s behind .
positive	almost .
positive	nothing is that smooth .
positive	and by the way , i have a tough thick beard ; she_loved snuggling up without the threat of whisker burn .
positive	many_thanks to royalshave .
positive	kabbage is awesome !!
positive	fees could be a little lower but a great company !
positive	!
positive	i had a problem at the beginning with my reservation and economy_car_rental did a great job to fix it .
positive	the maggiore in naples - italy is always one of the best , the only problem is that you need to take a bus for arrive to their location and the traffic is what is it !
positive	we drop the car off the day before and was really easy .
positive	of course we '_ll be back .
positive	the only concern is if the economic car_rental can reimburse the exceed to the car_rental company so they will not hold so much money for your rental , it would be awesome to rent again with you !
positive	extensive product inventory , easy to purchase , what you want when you need it .
positive	they have good prices and they get the parts to you in good time .
positive	received key very quickly after going through a few safety checks .
positive	top service .

positive	nice quick service .
positive	yes i recommend them ..
positive	always easy and a great price

positive	i just ordered flowers for my mum for mother '_s day in england on sunday .
positive	it was really easy to navigate the website , and there was plenty of choices available even_though it is only a couple of days before mother '_s day .
positive	i could have even had them delivered the same day , but chose saturday instead .
positive	overall , i was very happy that i managed to sort this out without_any_problems .
positive	hostelworld is truly a backpackers best friend abroad .
positive	with the lonely_planet guidebooks being so poor so these days , it has_been important to me to supplement its material with an outside source , especially when it comes to accommodation .
positive	what makes the site so useful is its candid reviews from fellow_travelers , which , in my opinion , is the most reliable feedback you can get and the ability to check availability and reserve a bed in just a few_clicks .
positive	a highly_reccommended website for accommodation bookings .
positive	easy navigation , good descriptions , fast processing - a good buying experience .
positive	i will_certainly be back for future blade ( or whatever shaving_needs ) orders .
positive	partsgeek was great .
positive	my order was processed immediately and i received my shipment in just 0 days , when i expected it in about a week .
positive	the parts work great .
positive	i will_definitely use them again .

positive	in short order she was able to tell me my options based on my requirements and then got me a nice discount .
positive	this is the only way to shop for storage .
positive	thanks
positive	was hoping to buy a replacement bulb but after going to the local_auto_parts store , found out i had to buy the assembly ... quoted approx .
positive	$_00 +_tax and 0 - 0 days for delivery to the local store .
positive	found stockwiseauto through amazon and received the order at my doorstep in 0 days for about 00_% less .
positive	packaging seemed just right ... not too little and not too much and offered protection to prevent_damage .
positive	not a scratch nor a scuff .
positive	i spent more time finding the right sized star tool in my tool box than i did installing the 0rd brake_light .
positive	so total time spent just installing the light was about 0 minutes ... unscrew the existing , unhook power harness , reconnect power harness to new light and screw it back on .
positive	perfect oem fit and has_been on 0 full day without_any_issues .
positive	just based on this limited experience i ' d give my recommendation , and i rarley give 0_stars but this couldn_'_t have been any easier and it was the best price i found even after paying for shipping .
positive	amazon had a comparable price , but they now charge sales_tax in ga so stockwiseauto was an obvious_choice .
positive	flight booking and all confirmation statements within 00_hours .
positive	perfect .
positive	the price says it all .
positive	in today '_s time that '_s what i look for is price and as long as they keep good parts at the best prices ill be a # 0 customer
positive	picked_up wae_+ through google shopping .
positive	prices were 00_% cheaper_than leading online_retailer .

positive	good find and will use and recommend wae_+ for the future .

positive	and always everything comes in time and in good condition .

positive	great product , great price and great service , thats all i have to say !
positive	i love their service
positive	i '_ve been using them for a number of years and always found them to be extremely_helpful and reliable .
positive	appliances_online provided an exceptional service from start to finish .
positive	not only were they one of the cheapest around , they also went the extra_mile to get the items delivered to a central_london location with extremely limited access .
positive	they provided great communication all the way through the ordering and delivery process - liaising with us and westminster council to have parking restrictions suspended in order to delivery a dishwasher and fridge_freezer .
positive	i wish more companies offered this good a service !
positive	this is the best antivirus , computer protection i ever used , scans complete , blocks sites , and removes viruses .

positive	this took a couple of emails to resolve , but i ' d rather have it this way .
positive	i began using al to purchase cars .
positive	later , their low price oil_changes attracted me to the service department .
positive	because of the first rate professional treatment i experienced with the oil_changes i soon expanded my use of al to include all service and maintenance requirements for both family vehicles .
positive	al makes the entire service experience virtually painless .
positive	from the ease of a telephone appointment and a crisp clean waiting room with coffee and computer use to a vehicle returned on tme with a 00 month guarantee on repairs , al consistently_provides top_notch performance .
positive	add to this the years of mechanical experience and professionalism offered by the al service managers and one has no need to ever look_elsewhere for auto servicing needs ,
positive	of particular note is my first hand and now long standing experience with armando garcia .
positive	armando '_s consistent actions and advice over several_years have given me the peace of mind that everyone looks for when spending hard_earned dollars for auto servicing needs .
positive	i know i can call upon armando for all of my mechanical needs and always receive honest and reliable results .
positive	i am very happy with product , shipping , and price , ty very much
positive	parts were exact_fit .
positive	prices were excellent , delivery was much faster_than_expected .
positive	just what internet ordering should be - click to basket , comes a couple of days_later - job_done
positive	only used cultpens a couple of times so_far but they did everything right with the minimum amount of fuss .
positive	we only stayed one night as a stop over to myrtle_beach , and when we arrived a the hotel all the paperwork was ready to sign which made the check in so much_quicker .
positive	after driving 00_hours straight it is nice to pull in and relax .
positive	after ordering a few_times from countryattire all i can say is that if you ' re looking for smart and durable clothing - this is the place to shop for it !
positive	one other thing is the free shipping - even to yours_truly living in sweden !!

positive	i had been looking for months and had seen the canterbury cold shirts before but they were all fairly expensive .
positive	that was until i found barrington_sports who had the same item but with 00_%_off .
positive	i jumped at the opportunity and ordered one .

positive	bought the metro strap and so_far i am very happy with the way it works .
positive	;-)
positive	i have purchased a number of warranties through square_trade and have been unfortunate to need them a few_times .
positive	in each case the process was appropriate and hassle_free .
positive	whether it was an item that needed repair or a total replacement , the claim process was straight_forward and met my every expectation .

positive	thank_you square_trade .

positive	have not yet made the visit to the hotel which i booked , but hoping everything to go fine .

positive	wide_selection of quality products and an easy - to - use website .
positive	toimitus tuli nopeammin kuin useammista verkkokaupoista ja hinta halvempi kuin muissa verkkokaupoissa ( ainakin tilaamani akun kohdalla ).
positive	ei voi muuta kuin suositella .
positive	pointshop on kätevä palvelu , käyn päivittäin keräämässä pisteet ja säästän ne jotain arvokkaampaa palkintoa varten .
positive	palvelu toimii lähes aina ; välillä " päivän kysymys " linkkien vihje - linkit eivät toimi ja joskus ovat jopa viitanneet sivustolle jossa ei ole ollut vastausta päivän kysymykseen .
positive	palvelu on kätevä , pienellä vaivalla saa kerättyä pisteitä ja vaihdettua ne tuotteiksi haluamallaan hetkellä .
positive	tosin joidenkin tuotteiden vaadittavat pistemäärät ovat hieman epärealistisia .
positive	aina kun olen ollut asiakaspalveluun yhteydessä vastaus on tullut nopeasti , eli plussaa siitä .
positive	loppujen lopuksi -> loistava sivusto .
positive	not always the cheapest but most of the time .
positive	always get good service and commucation .
positive	they will beat any other competitors price on any supplement , and they carry everything !!!
positive	the supplements arrive when they promise and it is the easiest purchase you will ever make online .
positive	i never shop anywhere_else for supplements !
positive	prepared as ordered , blew my expectations out of the water , beautiful labels
positive	a great bargain and very convenient .
positive	easy to find stuff , hassle - free ordering , and great prices .
positive	and now quick shipping .
positive	good stuff !
positive	finding , ordering and servicing is top_notch .
positive	yo hago llamadas a cuba que siempre son extremadamente caras y de mala calidad a pesar de_la cercania con_los estados unidos , con_el_servicio de rebtel solo tengo que marcar el numero de acceso y rapidamente me comunica con_mi familia en cuba y_con una calidad exelente , yo le recomiendo este servicio a todos_los que lean esta revision .

positive	arrived as_promised .
positive	priced_competitively .
positive	i did not think i could get as good service from an on - line provider as i get from the local t - shirt print shop ; i was wrong .
positive	the website was " wicked " easy and there was a person to live_chat with to get me through the process and make_sure i picked out the right colors .
positive	also , i needed the shirts fast ( my fault for procrastinating ) and it was not a problem .
positive	on top of that , they gave a small discount for good measure !
positive	i am a very happy customer !
positive	viele feine angebote , guter kundenservice , und seit paypal gehts wirklich schnell :-)

positive	i found the selection and configuration process on dino_pc '_s website very easy to follow including the ordering and payment process .
positive	my computer arrived from dino_pc within the estimated delivery date and packed as stated on the website .
positive	setting_up of my new computer was extremely easy and took hardly any time or effort ; the only time taken was the usual software updates required for windows .
positive	i was also extremely happy that there was no pre_- loaded junk / software on the computer , no ' trial ' software or programs either like you normally get from a shop bought computer and to cap it all the final price was much_cheaper_than a comparitive computer from one of the usual high_street pc retailers .
positive	overall i was , and still am , very impressed and extremely_satisfied !
positive	thankyou dino_pc !
positive	great prices and a very large_selection of products to chose from .
positive	every time i order from sw i receive my supps in a day or two .
positive	could not fault the service that was provided and would be happy to use it over and over again very quick and plesant serivce
positive	i have just booked a parking spot with skypark for my next holiday abroad .
positive	i am afraid that this review will be very boring because there were no_problems with the booking , no frightening prices to make me anxious , nothing i didn_'_t understand .

positive	paid up front , no_hidden_charges when i arrived at destination .
positive	alamo were pretty rubbish , booked a car months in advance at a specific time to arrive and be told that they didnt have the car i booked .
positive	stood waiting for over an_hour .
positive	finally got a car , but it was dirty .
positive	however , the return of the car was amazing .
positive	drive in , park up , remove your luggage , someone gives it the once over and you get a ticket to say everything is ok . 0 minutes !
positive	cant_fault rentalcars . com though .
positive	would book with them , but would be tempted away from alamo .
positive	i was a little_bit_hesitant to order from ties . com for fear of bad quality with the low_prices , but am so glad to see that the quality is great !!

positive	i haven_'_t used black_circles before but found the process fast and efficient , the only blip in the purchase was the requirement to upload my driving_licence when i wanted to spread the payments over 00 months , and despite my best efforts my licence verification was rejected ... but was accepted the next_day .
positive	happy with the process and it was very convenient with the garage less_than 000 yards from my doorstep .
positive	i have made several bookings with parcel0go on behalf of the company i work for .

positive	you did what you said that you would do when you said that you would do it - thanks !
positive	everything was ordered perfect and in great shape .
positive	also the delivery came in 0 and 0 days instead of 0 to 00 days .
positive	everything was ordered correctly and the web_site made it clear on which part fit which model car .
positive	one thing though .
positive	i ordered left and right brake sensors .
positive	they are different and the package did not say which one was left or right .

positive	people '_s faces when i say it includes 0kg of chicken_breasts is worth the purchase alone !

positive	years of cooking sub_par supermarket meat and watching steaks shrink up are now a thing of the past .
positive	i '_m with musclefood all the way and will_continue to shop with them .

positive	no_fuss , all done very smoothly .

positive	there is no_doubt this site is sleek and easy to browse .

positive	over the years i have ordered several safilo # 0000 frames because the quality is absolutely first rate .
positive	i ordered my latest frames from afeyewear . com because i could not find them locally .
positive	after ordering them i was notified that they were on backorder .

positive	i would recommend partsgeek to anyone .
positive	great people that helped out at enterprise - easiest time renting a car ever .
positive	great price too .... thanks !
positive	i '_m very glad for the opportunity to tell you about these_guys .
positive	they filled my order and shipped quickly ; that '_s great .
positive	but lots of hobby outlets will do that .
positive	their difference was that they actually had the items they listed .
positive	0000 had 0 items i had been after for a long time .
positive	at_least three other sellers " listed " those kits ; only to tell me ( after the fact ) that they were not only oop ( which i knew ) but oos ( which i didn_'_t know until i opened their package ).
positive	yes , that '_s right : from at_least 0 of them ; i was not told they were oos three of my items , until those things failed to appear on the shipping invoice ,
positive	in principal :
positive	if i can '_t get what i '_m looking for from " seller a , b or c "; they should have been courteous enough to say " we ' re oos this item and don_'_t know if it can be restocked .
positive	we should have left them out of the catalog .
positive	".
positive	o . k .
positive	!
positive	that '_s a good answer !
positive	now i can try to get those kits from " seller d ", or off ebay .... whichever .
positive	0000 had everything they said they had ; i got everything i ordered .
positive	seems like a small thing , but it '_s important .
positive	there is no_doubt that i will be buying from 0000 model_kits again , in the near_future .
positive	cheers !

positive	i bought a gretsch g0000 online with reidy_'_s at 0000am saturday 00th_may .
positive	the finance decision was immediate , reidy_'_s processing was put into place .
positive	( though 00 hour service i didn_'_t expect saturday and sunday to come into the equation to which i was correct .)
positive	i got confirmation monday 00th_may at approximately 00 : 00_hours that it had been dispatched and a tracking_number and was informed i would receive an e_-_mail the following_day to tell me the time_slot to expect to delivery .
positive	i tracked the order throughout the night with no_problems then received an e_-_mail at 00 : 00_hours on 00th_may informing_me that i would receive the goods between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00_hours ( though a slight_hiccup there i received at 00 : 00_hours . the goods were well_packed and safely delivered with an_apology from the courier .
positive	despite one small_hiccup of 0hour and 00_minutes i am 000_% satisfied and give the whole service and response 0_stars and will_continue to use reidy_'_s in future for future_purchases and recommendations .
positive	the parts_geek csr that helped_me ( chris m ) is as good as they get .
positive	he made me feel that pg truly wanted my business while presenting a thoroughly professional , yet personable image .
positive	you could sense that his ultimate goal was to ensure pg met all of my automotive_needs .
positive	he is quite an_asset to parts_geek .
positive	as for the positive efforts of parts_geek - i was totally_blown_away when i found the parts i had ordered friday_afternoon in my mailbox early monday_afternoon .
positive	that type of delivery is nearly_impossible except for very expensive services like ups or fed_ex next_day , but this package was simply 0st_class usps postage .
positive	when a problem , of my doing , showed_up , parts_geek assured me they would take whatever steps they needed to solve my dilemma .
positive	in my opinion , that ’_s the kind of service you get from a local parts supplier that you build up over many_years - yet this was my first visit to parts_geek .
positive	if they all go this smoothly , i ’ ll never need to shop anywhere_else .

positive	i do a considerable_amount of hobby trading on ebay .
positive	i found an item i wanted to build and present to a physician friend who has provided me with competent and compassionate healthcare over the past decade , but found the ebay price and s &_h to be unrealistic for a new but relatively common product .
positive	i decided to research the product on hobbylinc , just to see if my theory of price gouging held true .
positive	even having to pay ga sales_tax , the hobbylink price was well below half of the asking price with s &_h charges for the identical item on ebay .
positive	there is a moral to this story .
positive	the trust you put into an on - line purchase must be equaled by the trustworthiness of the seller .
positive	with ebay , you are not dealing_with a company that must maintain its reputation of fairness , but an individual who can assume a new identity from one transaction to the next .
positive	buyer_beware .
positive	trust has a tangible value and should be considered whenever making purchases too good to be true , even more so than when the circumstances have already caused your defense mechanisms to activate .
positive	the cost of peace of mind is sometimes negligible when compared to what is at risk .
positive	best regards , grey wolf - columbus ga
positive	i wanted to get a stethoscope for my fiancée , and they helped_me with not only the purchase and engraving of the stethoscope , but also finding a nice physician bag to keep that and some other stuff in .
positive	spoke with them on the phone three_times , and they were excellent with their help !
positive	shipped fast , and couldn_'_t have been happier with them !
positive	i can buy locally at ferguson , etc .
positive	but i did a little searching on ebay and found ingram '_s .
positive	after checking them out - researching their location and reading_reviews - i placed an order .
positive	the price was great and they tossed in a 00kw heat strip for free !
positive	buy from ingram '_s and save some cash !
positive	good service easy to find what your looking for
positive	i haven_'_t actually used he parking voucher yet but the website , booking form , and value cannot be_bettered .
positive	excellent service from festive_lights , the products were well_packaged and the tracking_system through fed_ex first_class .
positive	when i seen the price i was very nervous .
positive	but after receiving the item in a great shipping time and obtaining exactly_what i needed i was blown_away .
positive	great job

positive	ok , so i have been struggling with losing and managing my weight as well as staying healthy .
positive	i swear i have so many physical and health problems from my surgeries in the past i just felt that i would never stay as fit and healthy as i wanted to .
positive	however when one of my family_members had this " heavy_duty shaker_bottle " from this place called supplement_warehouse i immediately questioned her on where she purchased that awesome looking bottle .
positive	once she told me about the site , the rest was history .
positive	see i was purchasing meal replacements from other_places but the prices for all foods and organic items are crazy sky high , but unfortunately i kept paying for the meal replacements that i wanted because i couldn_'_t find any place else that was selling it .
positive	well , not only does this sight sell what most stores don_'_t , it compares prices to other competitors .
positive	i was literally able to find an item on another site , post the url in the item i wanted from supplement_warehouse and i got it for cheaper on this sight .
positive	no other sight compares to this honestly , and so i will keep investing with this company .
positive	oh not too mention you also can gain additional items for free with your purchases .
positive	a good web_site to find your spares , mine was a wheel for a dishwasher .
positive	no problem to find and match up and delivery was prompt .
positive	all arrived in a short time and was good value

positive	on the few occasions when something arrived inoperable , mcm has_been most righteous in correcting the problem or replacing the unit , hassle - free .
positive	their shipping is as fast and expedient as anyone i have ever done business with online .
positive	even when i have orders shipped to other_places around the country , they are received quickly .
positive	on of my most_recent_purchases , an amplified hdtv antenna and amplified speakers were the same exceptional values i '_ve come to expect from mcm .
positive	fantasic website that allowed_me to shop , compare and view specs on tech gear .
positive	easy checkout .
positive	not sure what else you could want .
positive	everything fit_perfectly as_advertised and looks great !
positive	really easy .... great website .... very fast response in terms of payments being_processed , and you are kept_informed every_step of the way , and you can store payment details for future transfers .
positive	and the main thing - the rates are far better_than you can get anywhere_else .
positive	found exactly_what i wanted , at a great price and then had the products delivered exactly when i was told they would be .
positive	cant_fault them .
positive	goods arrived as_promised on time and packed well .

positive	i had two payments to send from uk to netherlands , and i sent the smaller one first to test things out .
positive	it went through just fine in two working days with a charge of less_than £ 0 , so i had no_hesitation sending the larger amount ( over £ 0000 ).
positive	i was able to speed up the payment by inviting some friends , so the recipient ended_up receiving the money the same day .
positive	the larger amount cost about £_00 in fees , but considering my bank would have charged a fee of at_least £_00 and then would have made money on the exchange_rate as well , i came out well ahead .
positive	the only friction was that i had to take a photo of my passport and email it to the transferwise people to confirm my account , which wasn_'_t exactly obvious from the instructions given .

positive	well i cant deny that this site is very awesome best prices i have seen till now the only_thing is they may take 0 to 0 hours for delievery but maybe because its the first time but still worth waiting :)
positive	actually this is from the best websites i bought from they now how to make everything safe and no delay they are very trusty site with perfect in everything the issue i hope you can do is maybe make some discounts to v . ip customers or people who buy alot from you so we feel we are special with some discounts offers .. etc
positive	i searched on line " everywhere " and could not find the " 00 "_x00 " size filter , with a merv 0 rating that i needed until i came upon this site .
positive	not only that .
positive	but i could order just a six pack at a time instead of twelve .
positive	this site was a pleasure to deal with .
positive	they communicated with me about my order quickly and it arrived quickly .
positive	after doing significant damage to my front_wheel , i contacted my lbs to get a new one .
positive	after being told it would cost almost $_000 i decided to search online , that '_s when i first noticed i could buy both front and rear_wheels for not much more than what i ' d pay for just the front_wheel here .
positive	a few well_known uk retailers popped_up with some good prices , but one i ' d never_heard of had an even better price and actually had stock .
positive	so after_reading a few reviews about merlin_cycles , i decided to sling them an_email_asking if the wheels i wanted to order are right for my bike and tires , they were and i proceeded with the purchase .
positive	now i was expecting to receive them in perth about 0_weeks after i ordered them .
positive	local retailers have a habit of not sending orders for days , so i was surprised to see they were dispatched the same day , even more surprised to have them on my doorstep 0 days_later .
positive	now merlincycles . com has replaced 0 of my most regularly used online bike shop websites and is the first one i recommend to anyone sick of being_ripped_off by australian retail_stores .
positive	reliable , precise and always helpful .
positive	i have been using hostelworld for over three years and i will keep doing it , i recommend this web_site to anyone_who travels on a budget .
positive	have fun
positive	performbetter is the company i can recommend strongly with up to date and excellent products .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in ordering from them .

positive	i '_m glad to mention that i passed the exam on the very next_day , without_any difficulty .
positive	thanks pmstudy .
positive	i have never had a problem buying at b_&_h_photo - video .
positive	this is one of the best websites i '_ve_seen for booking places to stay in .
positive	all the info is there , the price for the length of stay , and how great is the hotel .
positive	i '_m definitely going to be using this website a lot for when i have to go on trips , or whenever i want a vacation .

positive	we leased a peugeot_000 for 000 days pick - up from amsterdam was hassle_free and the gentleman gave_us a full overview of the car which we never got when we leased another french car the year before .
positive	we drove around western and central europe for 000 days with no_hassles at all and dropped it back near charles de gaulle airport with ease .
positive	the communication via_email for the drop_off was excellent .
positive	i would hesitate to use this service again and recommend it to other peolpe .
positive	very impressed with the range of goods offered , the free p_+ p , and the generous discounts for bulk orders .
positive	i ordered at 0pm , goods were here the next_day at 00 .
positive	quality of packaging was good and goods were received undamaged .
positive	i was impressed by the staff at the fitting_centre , they started the job exactly at the time when the car was booked in , and within an_hour 0 tyres were fitted , an oil_change completed , and advice was given to me about a suitable spare for the car , as it is not a standard fitment .
positive	it was explained to me exactly_what the job would involve , and they treated my car with respect .
positive	for rental_cars and hotels - you cannot beat the price - especially if u bid .
positive	flights are okay but can at times be inconvienant , you need to be very flexible .
positive	cars are the easiest because you get exactly_what you bid on and although you cannot use your gold status or emerald if you let the agent know when picking_up your vehicle you part of program from which are renting they usually will either upgrade u for free or give u a good choice .
positive	hotels the same if you bid on hotels by star level and you are lucky_enough to get a hotel you are member there is a good chance when u check in they and tell them u r gold_member they will treat as such .
positive	at times it can be somewhat tricky , but if you know the area you usually get a great hotel at up to 00_%_off .
positive	the only draw backs are you cannot cancel or change your reservation if you bid , you must prepay and if want to extend your stay , u may get the same rate or better but you have to pay the same booking_fee again .

positive	the website was easy to work and ordering the product was simple .
positive	shipping cost was a nice surprise .

positive	i have had gotabackup for around a year and a half now and the experience has_been flawless .
positive	i found gotabackup when looking for a cloud backup service one day and came_across their site and was amazed by the price , £ 0 . 00 for unlimited backup ?!
positive	count me in !
positive	being a student i have important files for coursework that need to be safe in the result of a hard_drive failure .
positive	and again as i am a student i could not go around spending vast amounts of money on a backup service so this service was perfect .
positive	i set it to run in the background backing up every file i want knowing that i never have to worry_about hitting storage limits as i get unlimited space ( i have already used nearly 0tb !).
positive	the staff are extremely friendly and resolve my issues if i ever ( rarely ) have any , i even find myself just having a general chat to them .
positive	security was another important issue for me , if my data is in a remote server i want to know that it is safe and unreadable to anyone but me .
positive	they use 000bit aes encryption that has never been cracked ( even by some of the most powerful supercomputers ).
positive	as long as you have a strong password your data isn_'_t going to fall into the wrong hands .
positive	lastly is speed .
positive	being someone_who luckily has a fast internet_connection i want to utilize that upload speed that i have .
positive	with other services i have found that they put artificial restrictions in place to slow down how fast all your files are backed_up , but not with gotabackup !
positive	if you are looking for an all_round excellent backup service , look no further !
positive	would 000_% recommend .
positive	booked a last_minute package and it was flawless from start to finish .
positive	did help that the hotel was a good pick .
positive	need to read the reviews of the hotels .
positive	can '_t fault shopto , always delivers the best service around
positive	the manager greeted me with a smile and was very thorough in going through all of the details of my rental .
positive	the facility is well - lit and seems very secure which is the main thing i was conerned about in leaving materials in a storage_facility .
positive	i got what i paid for and the part was in excellent condition .
positive	a small order this time , but just as always , was dispatched and received quickly and efficiently .
positive	understood what we needed and was able to help at a better price than we could have hoped for .
positive	i '_m one of those people who are very picky about their pens .
positive	cult_pens seem to have all variations of pen / pencil ( width ; nib type ; colours etc ) available .
positive	delivery is very quick as well ; good site good service .
positive	order came the very next_day and i was happy with the product ty :)
positive	i ordered flowers for my girlfriend in edinburgh .
positive	i '_m an american so i don_'_t know what the flower business in the uk is like , and my girlfriend had previously told me that flowers are very expensive over there .
positive	so when i saw bouquets for £_00 , i didn_'_t know how nice they ' d be .
positive	i was also worried she wouldn_'_t get them if she wasn_'_t home for the delivery .
positive	but they left the flowers at her door and they were beautiful .
positive	this place is now my uk florist .
positive	my 00 dodge_neon transmission pan has no drain_plug , everytimes i want to change fluid i have to remove 00 hex bolt to drain , very messy .
positive	so i decide to go online to search for the pan that have drain_plug .

positive	great prices from outdoor world direct and the items were dispatched immediately .

positive	taunton_leisure offered the best price , delivery costs were reasonable and they were dispatched quickly .
positive	cannot_fault the the company , website is easy to usee and i would definitely use them again .
positive	i '_ve transferred over £ 0000 to india via transferwise over 0 transactions .
positive	smooth transactions , haven_'_t had any hassles trouble so_far .
positive	the money always reaches day earlier_than promised .
positive	it give much_better exchange_rate compared to citibank i used earlier but on some days sbi uk gives slightly better rate especially if the rate goes down after sbi had set their daily rate in the morning .
positive	very satisfied with the service but i ' d still check the rate against sbi before making each transfer .
positive	great service - very fast , accurate and efficient .
positive	i hunted website after website and couldn_'_t figure_out what all i needed .
positive	their site was direct , explained everything and had complete packages in different price ranges .
positive	since this was a surprise , i had to guess on some measurements .
positive	their customer service noticed i may have the sizes wrong and sent me info to make corrections .
positive	it would have been way off if they hadn_'_t taken the time to ask me questions .
positive	it was as good a shopping_experience as i could have hoped for .
positive	quality products , quality service and quality delivery ...
positive	excellent !
positive	purchased roland drum_kit which is excellent and at the right price , the service over the phone talking to jim was second to none , he was very very helpfull and all promises were fulfilled , real old fashion values not always available from other_companies , " thanks jim !

positive	the advertised pricing may have gotten me to try them but it was the outstanding service that has kept me coming_back .
positive	i confess that i have had to use the ' free tire replacement ' service more than once .
positive	frankly , given the mileage we put on our cars , i have had very few tire or wheel problems over those years but , when i have , they have always taken_care of me .
positive	whether it was a corroded rim or a screw through the sidewall , the staff , in the shop and out front , have gone the extra_mile to make_sure i know what has happened and the ' best ' ( for me ) solution to the problem .
positive	staff turnover appears to be low as have seen and gotten to know the sales_staff and technicians over the years so i am confident that they know tires ( and alignment ) and are committed to service to their customers .
positive	i don_'_t look_forward to having to service my tires but , when i have to , i look_forward to going to my friends at town_fair_tire !

positive	my review is above
positive	i searched online for the perfect car .
positive	after going from used car dealer to new car dealer i came_across public motors .
positive	i was skeptical at first , but ended with a really great deal from their live auto auction they have every sunday .
positive	i was going to wait for wednesday '_s live auction but couldn_'_t make in time .
positive	i never been to a live auction before , so it was fun and exciting .
positive	i found a nice bmw for super cheap , just got the car so no_issues , runs great , i even purchased the warranty which was great since most auction places don_'_t offer any kind of warranty .
positive	the staff we ' re friendly and nice .
positive	they gave_me no pressure and explained the auction process to me .
positive	i even got to ring the auction bell after i won the bidding .
positive	overall i '_m happy with my new car and would recommend to my family or friends .
positive	thank_you public motors !
positive	if you ' re shopping for bicycle parts online , you really can '_t go past chain_reaction cycles - be sure you get the right chain_reaction cycles in northern_ireland and not those with the same name but located elsewhere .

positive	like most people who want a picture framed - this has involved driving into town , paying to park , hauling the picture into the shop , paying up front and then waiting three_weeks to go in again and collect it .
positive	but no more !
positive	once i had mastered the website for picture - framing ( not difficult but i am of the pre pc generation !)
positive	and got my measurements right for the picture - why did it look so small on the screen mock - up - well cm is not mm , friends - it was then plain_sailing .
positive	the picture frame was delivered to our door by inlerlink express three_days_later .
positive	well_done them - and you can track their delivery driver on line which is amusing !
positive	it was delivered within the promised one hour_slot ( please_note - currys !)
positive	and phew , the picture fitted_perfectly .
positive	and it came with picture wire / screws and tabs for the bottom so that the picture fits flat to the wall .

positive	great products , great site , even great when i had an issue with something .
positive	no company i trust more .
positive	i was overall very pleased with my purchase ; heinnie provided means of tracking my package which i thought was a very nice_touch .
positive	i was able to check for myself that they shipped the order asap .
positive	the package itself was delivered within the indicated time frame , in good condition , sensible packing ( foam padding etc ).
positive	product didn_'_t dissapoint .
positive	will_definitely come_back for more boyish spending .
positive	i went on line which is all new to me being an old fart !
positive	i found heinnie_haynes site and i have to say i thought there has to be a catch here ( its bound to be from usa ) but no its was from barry the home of gavin & stacy !
positive	the price was good and the service was very prompt ( i did not pay £ 0 for next_day delivery being a mean old fart )

positive	to ensure that i had the car i requested some 0 months earlier i visited the national store in anaheim the day before pick_up and asked would i get a mustang ?
positive	, they checked and advised that i would have one . picked it up next_day , ran like a dream had more room than a camero , as i was going with an aussie convoy to vegas . fuel usage was 00 . 0 mpg , not bad , as my old gt falcon would only get 00mpg or put simply 00 . 0ks per 0 . 0 liters , compared 00 liters . but note these are smaller gallons than imperial so did quite well as was 000 - 000_km / h . car was clean , drove like a dream i want one , hurry up ford australia and bring on the mustang v0 of course .
positive	thing i did notice that was lacking is no reversing camera a must in all cars .
positive	very fast , very accurate .
positive	will absolutely order from again if needed .

positive	i will be using the supplement_warehouse from now on , and recommending it to anyone and everyone that i meet !

positive	- the only_downside is that i get too much information from them , but i can easily delete what i don_'_t need
positive	- summary - unlike most internet companies , they seem to take customer service seriously
