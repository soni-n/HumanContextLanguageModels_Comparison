positive	order a set of thomastik infeld flatwounds at a very competitive price and they arrive a couple of days_later .
neutral	feel the system is let_down by bad deliveroies , sad .
neutral	nothing to add as it says it all in the title .
negative	such a shame and a let_down to serenata .
negative	at this point , i am left without_any glasses , without my money , just angry and disappointed .
positive	wanted to clear junk .
positive	didnt know anything about them , but after calling everything was explained excellent to me . no_hassle , no third_party payments or numerous online forms . fast and honest .
negative	still none the wiser what '_s going on
negative	when i asked the delivery man , whom i was having to help_unload the shed and carry it into the garden myself , how he was supposed to move the heavy bits on his own , he said " i have to slide them ".
neutral	was very pleased with the overall cost of x 0 blinds .
positive	i '_ll be back for more .
positive	the quoting system was spot - on , and they offered me an option to send it myself with my own box , or have one sent out - best of all , for free .

neutral	no response from company when emailed .
positive	epic company
positive	a bargain , jump in board and get one yourself
negative	as i was a self_employed horse rider i didn_'_t get much of an income so went for the cheapest tyre available .
negative	since then i try to avoid anyone that uses_yodel as a courier service .
neutral	he was asked does any of the part go inside the hole cut in the door .
negative	thats when it all went wrong , buggy and high chair quick to arrive , but much needed raincover for our phil and ted '_s sport never arrived .
positive	they have an impressive range and their prices compare well with other_sources .
negative	i am just so frustrated - and am out the money i paid for a month , which is very frustrating since i didn_'_t even use the service !
negative	i later contacted groupon who said they would refund me however been a lay person i took there word for it and didn_'_t check my statement .
negative	i have been with t - mobile for several_years_now i these problem that are occurring seem to becoming more frequent meaning every other day for the last 0 months .
neutral	since i have changed , i am not able to get a wireless_signal anywhere in the house .
neutral	great product when they finally arrived after delay and constant_chasing from me on a delivery date !
neutral	i rang their customer service number and was told they would email me that day with an explanation of what the delay was .
neutral	on this occasion one pair is perfect , but the other is slightly too small .
neutral	when put on you can '_t see out of it so walking blind most of the time .
positive	the layout of the website took a little_bit of getting used to , and it would be nice to be able to narrow_down the searches to " own - brand " or list by cheapest . but perhaps they are included features i '_m just missing how to use ?
positive	i ordered net_curtains and they arrived in good time .
neutral	need to learn a lesson from marks and spencer , who do offer the unpacking / removal of packaging service .
negative	no still_waiting for a correct final statement , i made one payment to them for the 0 week period and then received a bill saying i still owed them ( on an estimated bill - even_though i had given them the readings on moving in ).
negative	very very dissapointed
neutral	my friend ordered a part off amazon , it was faulty , they sent him a fresh one out with the return instructions and paid postage included .
positive	goods ordered late_afternoon , and delivered by royal_mail at lunchtime next_day , even after selecting 00 hour delivery option .
neutral	the jacket its self is a fantastic design which fits close to the body whilst keeping you warm and great in the rain but i have problems closing the second and third zip , had it not been for this issue i would have said its the best jacket i '_ve bought in a long time !
negative	( at 0pm !!!)
neutral	whilst the online booking experience was fine and in general the delivery service was ok , it '_s a little annoying that the booking system promised something that couldn_'_t be delivered .
positive	they sent emails on delivery progress and the package arrived bang on time .
negative	" we have received the revisions that you want , and our designers are starting their work on your project "
positive	!
neutral	this was my first order with boohoo . com it was free delivery ( with code ) and free_returns .
positive	a delivery query was resolved very swiftly
neutral	straight on the shuttle_bus to the compound to pick the car up and off i drove after zero familiarisation from the sbyc employee .
positive	express free delivery
positive	good communication on delivery
negative	dealing_with them now is just an extra worry i never expected to have and dread the thought of having to stay them !!
neutral	we have always been delighted with serenatas service and will not let this colour our judgement , and although my wife was disappointed we hope that this was just a ' one - off !'
negative	the service is shocking
positive	order came promptly and beautifully_packed , would recommend to anyone .
neutral	i would be wary of purchasing from the site again as my dress looked a lot better on the site , and for a garment that is so simple to get right i would be afraid to get anything_else !
positive	you also get a clue as to what else you might need to order or what you may have forgotten to order .
neutral	great idea for a range of food , regrettably not for us although we will sample from time to time to see if things change to better meet our expectations .
neutral	it looked as though it had been screwed_up at the bottom of the washing basket for days - and it had no tag !
negative	we called out homeserve , but while waiting i traced the fault to a leaking pipe under the floor .
positive	their site is simple and easy to navigate with tons of search options .
positive	really professional service from_start to finish , if you want a van , go swiss !
negative	i rent a car for 0_days in miami ( usa ) i have an american driver license and they did not want to accept it !!!
neutral	unfortunately , after a few uses , it became_apparent that it was faulty as the toast was cooking very unevenly .
negative	following the sites payment system breakdown , i asked to be told when it would be up and running , so that i could pay for my order .
positive	on the whole we have never had a bad_experience with amigo_autos and will_continue to use them
neutral	however disappointed as although said gave_me 00_quid for my blackberry_curve it was more like 00 after i had paid for postage back with security of signed for .
neutral	recently i have had several bad_experiences not with ebuyer but with the delivery company they use .
neutral	it took 0_days
neutral	the flowers were lovely but now do not match
neutral	the delay worried me , but everything turned_out well in the end .
negative	waste of time & petrol !
neutral	then they offered to give me the one from the shop floor , which everyone would have tried on .
neutral	i was disappointed when my order for perspex sheeting arrived with every sheet broken .
negative	the ending result is that you will never be used again as you can '_t be trusted to deliver .
positive	beautiful bag .
positive	credit where credits due , people are keen to knock when things go_wrong but they deserve their five_star_rating , will_definately use again , cheers coolshop !
negative	so avoid if you can but seeing though they ' re weaved into almost every online shop its not that easy !
neutral	small mishap but will use them again .
negative	when i wrote in to complain_about the loss of service , which cost my business money !
negative	wonderful !
neutral	but eventually got the glasses very late
positive	very helpful staff and quick delivery .
positive	would highly_recommend .
negative	when the part had still not arrived by 0 . 00pm i called again to be told that the part would definitely be delivered today .
neutral	deliver was good , was told best way to unpack it , but had trouble as men had bought it in back to front so had to try and change the big box around correctly once it was in .
negative	i said that is fine but i still would like an answer as to why my flowers were not delivered and why i was not informed - do they do this to everyone who orders internation flowers ??
positive	i purchased an_overlocker from you , and apart_from being a beautiful looking
negative	delivered to completly the wrong_address .
positive	i '_d definitely buy from them again .
neutral	beige fitflops were different_shades and packed in polythene_bag - obviously not a pair !
negative	all they did was cancel my order with them .
positive	will use again .
positive	quick , great choice , lots of additions and very easy to use !
neutral	product arrived day after it should have done and did not contain the free sample that is all part of the ' premium service '.
positive	both are qualities which tick the boxes .
positive	i wanted a large banner but the image i had was quite low resolution .
positive	i was even more please when , after just over an_hour , i had an email from my partner thanking_me for a lovely surprise !!!
negative	this company run the biggest scam i have ever_seen .
negative	update .
positive	no_problems just read above_sentence .
positive	the flowers have always looked the same as the do in the pictures , which is not always the same with some other_suppliers .
positive	the superdry_jackets i bought for my sons are brilliant .
neutral	this just means that the charger will charge 0 . 0 and 0ah_batteries .
positive	some makes were thrown out of running straightaway ( for my particular needs ) and i was glad to have advice saying if this is important to you consider this make , if you want something_else look at these machines .
neutral	on our return_journey , late at night with two small children , we had to wait about half an_hour to have our cars returned ( two families ).
positive	would be perfectly happy to recommend to friends and family .
positive	i would certainly use the company again .
positive	i entered my details on the website on the thursday_evening , my postage bag arrived the next_day !
positive	i ordered a hoover hose , it arrived very quickly . it was good value for the money and i got a pen in the parcel too . but the only bad thing is , i now have got to do some housework .
neutral	this should of course be automated .
positive	they could have easily tried to sell me a new tyre but happily repaired the puncture without_hesitation .
neutral	also , i have some mild concerns about the product supplied .
negative	00 : 00 : 00 or can you book it in now ?
negative	oh , ok . we ' re about this life .
neutral	so i had a couple bags of d - aa and along with that i got a free_sample of complete pre_- workout watermelon and instant bcaa .
neutral	i am in the process of evaluating these coffees
neutral	but overall fast service , very easy and i '_d do it again with other phones .
negative	same goes for ordering dog dewormers !
negative	the run around and lies they kept giving me were unacceptable .
positive	i went to this company . after finding them online . i rang them they had the parts . and within one hour my 00 " tv was repaired . great bunch of guys . genuine and helpfull . and great to recycle .
negative	i now have to go through the lengthy procedure of trying to reclaim my money via my credit_card provider .
positive	good price for a great collar only problem is it '_s a bit_tight and next size up hangs too loose .
negative	anyway moving on , as a buyer i recently ordered a football_shirt from liverpool . tv and whilst delivery times were good i was at home on the day of delivery and while waiting for a knock ( i just happened to see him turn_up ) i was able to stand and watch when , instead of knocking so i could answer and take half the time it took him to post it , he proceeded to ram it through .
positive	first_class service ordered 0 metre length garage_door brush seal , arrived next working day well_packaged 0_star
negative	gumtree is a jungle which is not helped by their own systems which are inadequate .
positive	the bouquet is gorgeous !
neutral	turned_up , and only 0 of the tyres had arrived .

positive	many_thanks , 0 *
positive	the cummerbund and bow_tie arrived very quickly and the quality appears very good looking_forward to wearing it .

negative	really disappointed as i was looking_forward to having my tyres_changed at home to save time and money before a long journey .
negative	update
negative	my kitchen has only just been decorated and the dark ' sticky tac ' is effectively very cheap , horrible blue tac .
negative	i won_'_t be buying again from them
neutral	no_problems with delivery - drivers always pleasant and helpful .
neutral	as i said though the staff are very different in store and can '_t do enough to help you .
neutral	the only_thing that would stop me using this website again was the delivery company !
positive	00 / 00 from me .
positive	many_thanks .
neutral	can '_t find the icon to print out my booking but otherwise it was straight_forward .
negative	meaning a missed collection takes another two_days unlike_other_companies they won_'_t send out another courier at their expense .
neutral	pleased with items received and delivery was swift however plastic_container was smashed so bird nuts mixed with broken plastic .
positive	the jacket was shipped quickly and is just what i ' d_hoped it would be .
negative	( rhetorical question ).
positive	very easy website to navigate , massive_range of invitations with matching extras & very quick delivery .
neutral	overall , no_problems until drop_off .

neutral	i recently_purchased what you advertised as genuine_hp_inks but after installing them my computer keeps alerting_me to say that one cartridge is not a genuine cartridge .
positive	look for reviews from similar people like yourselves e . g .
negative	then received email asking me to rate service ?
positive	i use it all the time !
neutral	jlp do it .
positive	the trees were delivered by the wednesday_afternoon after ordering on a saturday_evening so more than exceeded_expectations .
neutral	however should have been told that it was on a noisy street ( cars and bikes ), opposite a school and a playing field with constant noise during day and into late evening
negative	chemaist direct use a courier company who only deliver during the day & need a signature .
positive	i love the range of glasses available and they ' re such good value .
neutral	let '_s be honest : selling houses isn_'_t difficult .
negative	telephoned and i had an answer with the tele no they suggest to ring .
negative	i found their explanation that they couldn_'_t liaise with this team over the phone absolutely incredulous , in the same way that it was not possible to excalate the complaint to a senior_member of staff .
negative	then went on to return part of my order via_royal_mail , which cloggs are denying having received .
negative	wiggle returns extremely poor , lack of direct communication , unavailable for contact except email or online_chat which is very fragmented .
positive	the technician was quick , friendly and efficient .
neutral	great overall service but as the survey is only valid for 0 months i had to do what they call a desktop re - survey .
neutral	if the prices to buy & sell keep rising as they have been doing , i wonder where ebay will be in five years from now ?
positive	banner was completed in a fast turn - around time , even_though i thought amendments would be needed once submitted ; and we received it earlier_than advised .
positive	simple location , easy ordering and payment and quick delivery thanks .
neutral	if it could not be repackaged and replaced with the right size it would be nice to be told that rather_than just be ignored .
negative	all attempts to get a response from the customer service department ( a contradiction in terms if there ever was one ) have gone_unanswered .
neutral	i had to phone to be told that part of my order actually wasn_'_t in stock and they '_d send it all when it arrived - they could send in two parts but would charge me extra postage .
negative	darren said the problem was caused by a vehicle breakdown .
neutral	update .
positive	placed my order at 0 pm friday and did not expect it until monday .
neutral	i still buy at auction , but think they would like to stop auctions and just have retail_outlets on there .
negative	not a single apology throughout the whole dealing_with them .
positive	fantastic .
negative	when i called to see where it was , i heard a long_drawn_out problem they are having with their orders that are going through argos .
positive	i certainly will be back !!
neutral	i ordered a0_calendar , but the quality seems too low to me .
neutral	although delivery was 000_miles_away so this put 000_miles onto the car that i did not do .
neutral	so that he wasn_'_t to be disappointed for longer_than necessary we ( that is he and his dad - me ) took the 00 mile or so drive to our nearest superdry shop in cardiff ( plus car parking charge ) and changed the jacket in store for him .
neutral	item arrived as expected and within stated delivery timeframe .
positive	however , a short phone_call and a discussion with on o the mic stores sales people and i felt very welcome .
neutral	however , during quite moderate use , the car developed a number of faults : the dashboard light started going off for no apparent_reason , which was worrying as the entire display was digital so you couldn_'_t see what speed you were doing ; the left - signal indicator light went out towards the end of the rental ; the plastic protector in the trunk came loose ; and as a short person i found the car_seat hard to adjust to a reasonable position .
negative	with over 00_minutes to spare , i was in no panic , i was sure that this could be sorted_out so we ambled over to the travel centre to explain , they asked for the seat_numbers ( we had two , two were missing ) so we checked the original e_- mail which read no reserved_seats , despite us having two at_least !
negative	there was no card or note from us in the delivery so my parents did not know who sent it until i asked if they recieved it and ther was no name of the florist .
negative	speaking nicely to them and asking if they would like any help !
neutral	i had a look under engine that night and discovered a bolt was missing from the bottom metal radiator hose where it bolts to the subframe , put a bolt in , knock gone .
positive	when i was first recommended cjs_cd_keys by a colleague , i was highly suspicious of the site being a possible scam .
positive	morag mcdonad
neutral	sadly the envelopes let the side down .
negative	we measured all our ushers for their waistcoats and every one of them we ordered came up a size smaller and so non fitted , we were able to shuffle round and order more but its been a nightmare to be hones . very unhappy customer
neutral	i won_'_t be using that insurer again and haven_'_t used this website since - why should i when it is clearly hit and miss .
negative	not only this but they were sending leaflets to my house , every one of them i returned to them asking for them to stop .
negative	you must do it in time
neutral	it '_s got a good range of products and that '_s the main_reason for choosing scubastrore , but it could had some more since i had to order some products from other_places .
positive	!
negative	i next checked my emails on sunday and there was an_email from viagogo saying the third delivery had failed and unless i called by 0 pm on sunday the tickets would be destroyed .
positive	in fact it was quite easy to get carried away with my ordering !
neutral	frustrating , delivery went_astray , second delivery arrived , box broken and wet !
positive	i came_across procook at cheshire_oaks a year and a half ago , made a couple of purchases and brought them back to london .

negative	an_hour later i got a text_message from bt saying , give us a call , we can beat that offer .
positive	can '_t fault the service i received .
positive	ordered the item on the thursday and was delivered on the friday of the next_day !!!
neutral	the website advertised that if i ordered before 0pm ( it was 0 . 00pm ), my flowers could be delivered same day .
neutral	there has also been allegations of the site refusing to ' display ' and therefore advertise certain films .
neutral	problem : i opted for excess_cover on the cardelmar website but the payment for it failed ( although payment for car was ok ).
negative	i did .
positive	site easy to use , quick & reliable
negative	will avoid paypal an even co '_s associated with them from now on .
negative	shower was dirty .
positive	fantastic product .
positive	i would highly_recommend this company , they were polite when taking the order , also very prompt with there delivery .
negative	they never once were understanding or apologetic and simply kept telling_me it was not their fault .
negative	i was new to 0 as from last friday 0th_february_0000 .
negative	!
negative	website is simple enough and can '_t complain with the prices , but the service is rubish , its ment to be instant delivery ( email code ) but i had to wait around 0 days , i actualy cancelled my oder because the service was so bad , i won_'_t use this site again and have told all my friends to not use it either .
positive	item as_described with a very prompt delivery i cannot_fault them in any way

negative	i '_m not buying anymore lottery tickets ( although toying with the irish one which , at the moment , is fairer to the player .)

negative	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has_been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
positive	they were very helpful sending by return swatches of materials which helped_us make our final choice .
negative	he told me that someone would phone back about my complaint .
negative	can '_t afford another hotel after forking_out £_00 .
neutral	i ordered a costume that promised to be 00 - 00 , which i thought would be fine , given that i '_m more towards a 00 , however the costume was very tight especially around the arms and bust_area .
neutral	however regardless of the above and where the fault laid the staff at malpensa were very helpful ( organizing the transfer to linate and adjusting the final invoice to the agreed_amount )
positive	pat on the back for you all . xx
negative	yesterday we received an_email to tell us the computers had been shipped to us .
negative	in other words i do not have any rights !!

negative	now awaiting delivery in yet anothert week of new replacement part to be able to build the bed .
positive	the party goods hit the spot and made the party go with a bang !
positive	i received excellent service in my recent_purchase of james_wellbeloved puppy_food .
negative	they take your hard_earned_money then send you an email and deliver the flowers when they feel like it .
neutral	there were small flying things and crawlers and i thought the mini fortefog would do the trick .
positive	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
neutral	it may well bloom dramatically with time , but that '_s one of the things we haven_'_t got .
neutral	w clark
positive	probably the only fault is that sagepay doesn_'_t work , if you don_'_t have paypal .
positive	ahhhh !

neutral	eventually they honoured their original quote .
negative	they are still selling rooms on their website for much higher prices than we paid . now we don_'_t have a hotel in glasgow because there is nothing available except for super hyper high prices because of the commonwealth games being on .
neutral	deliveries that i have had from john_lewis and from laura_ashley always unpack the item carefully , take away the wrappings ( there was a lot of cardboard and polystyrene etc ) and make_sure that it is in its desired place .
positive	not physically seeing the watch i was a little_apprehensive_about ordering it on line , but upon_receipt i was absolutely_delighted with my choice .
positive	would definitely use this company again as the service is one of the best i have received from an internet_shopping store .
positive	i '_ve ordered several_times from guitar_fx direct and been really pleased with their service every time .
neutral	full_tank at 000_euros is expensive .
neutral	a pity .
neutral	i have always found valueshop deliver the correct order in a timely_fashion .
negative	i booked through cruise . com and the cruise was cancelled and they said it was because i was british
positive	couriers that go out of their way and are reputable .

positive	excellent service .
negative	we called customer_services and were left on hold for at_least half an_hour so we thought we will call again later , however yet again we were left on hold .
negative	the amazon website is excruciating to use , the streaming content has many titles that are charged for in addition to the streaming subscription charge , amazon made seperate charges for the streaming service and billed another credit_card for which they had the details for from purchases i had made from them in the past which is outrageous ( i wasn_'_t notified of this and only found out by chance ).
neutral	not sure if i would buy anything again .
neutral	this is a cheap and cheerful service .
positive	excellent all_round .
negative	paypal is extremely unhelpful in dealing_with customers and blocks their payments with no justifiable reason .
positive	the heinz products available in sa are ghastly .

neutral	no_problems purchasing the products .
positive	i love mmoga because it is a cheap and reliable website with a range of good prices .
negative	both_times my order from the other company arrived before my order placed with pet_supermarket .
negative	the service
negative	but after that phone_call - their customer service is awful !
negative	me : " so why has nobody bothered to let_me know its not coming today ?"
negative	worse still , because its tucked_away in the terms & conditions the excuse is that they are only providing a service rather_than goods which means paypal won_'_t refund it either .
positive	will be definitly using again in the near_future .
negative	on calling and discussing with paypal they adised me they had recieved numerous_calls regarding escapade today !
negative	this company is a farce , like others , if i could give - 0 i would .
positive	0st_class service yet again . thanks .
negative	order received but a day late , no reply from beautybay and no refund of my postage cost .

neutral	we bought some medical trousers which have not lasted and worn through the knees so we tea trying the red hawk trousers disappointing colour range for women means we have had to order mens ' versions , so far we have had to send some back for sizing and and another pair for a broken clasp - the refunds have come through quickly , but the returns have to be taken to a local shop which has awkward parking and is no - where on our normal errand runs - it would be easier to use the post_office !

positive	v . happy
neutral	when the tickets had not arrived two_days before the concert - we had to fly to the event - we ended_up chasing the courier and had to collect from their office rather then have them delivered .
neutral	in the meantime i reserve judgment whether the system really will avoid the sort of fogging problems i have had with glasses .
negative	surely they should keep the customer informed ?

neutral	but the same cannot be said for the products !
neutral	lastly , 0 years_ago you were also beating your competitors , offering more money and better security / assurance ( in what was a new process for me ) in that you were orange , or very least you are directly associated with them .
positive	the online site is straight_forward to use , i did hiccough on set_up , down to my lack of practice , a simple phone_call resolved it .

neutral	very pleased , although i receive e_-_mails stating 00per cent offers and when i order i do not receive the discount .
negative	the ( limited ) uk service support is arguably better_than many of the biggest isps and the staff are for the large part friendly and with good intentions .

positive	had to phone customer_services as one product was not as expected ( actually because the manufacturer had changed the product since i '_d last purchased ).
negative	we spent over £_000 on flowers with you and every rose . has died within three_days .
neutral	i realise that the company needs to make money but i really think that £_00 . 00 per booking is a bit much .

neutral	check the reviews before you order , there are some really dodgy takeaways on my site
neutral	the ordering_process was quick and easy however so really hope the flowers met with my expectations
positive	ordering from chemist_direct is so easy and big_savings as well
neutral	i made the change less_than 00hrs since paying and the brochure price for the new holiday was over £_000 cheaper yet they gave_me £_00 back , it would have been cheaper to go to the travel_agents , they tell me there would have been no charge for this , but how do you fight your corner properly at the end of a phone ( which by the way cost me over £ 0 )
neutral	i ordered 00 00 page a0_leaflets for a client .

negative	it '_s time to start looking at alternative shops .
negative	ryanaiir '_s motto is ' cheapest airline ' and that '_s all it is really .
negative	as this was to be a gift for the end of the month i decided to order from spoiled brat rather_than the manufacturer ( the manufacturer had free delivery and a 00_%_off first order ) as i did not want to wait_until the 0rd_january which was the date given if i bought direct .
positive	first time used and happy so as to have recomendid it to others
neutral	don_'_t blame the customer for the fact that you have bad information to hand - and then refuse to listen to the correct information ( so you can update your records and not do the same to anyone_else in the future ).
neutral	customer service very poor so would not use again .
neutral	they did non of the above , resulting in the parcel being left with a neighbour who forgot to tell anyone_else in the house , therefore it couldn_'_t be found when we went to collect it ----------- you couldn_'_t write a better scrip on how to irritate !!!!
negative	i found their whole manner very rude and will never use them again .

negative	very bad_experience .
negative	i went on their website and bought a pair of dj cd players - or so i thought .
negative	in brief .

positive	i looked on the internet for a local_florist to her .
positive	very pleased .
neutral	i have tilers etc all lined_up an waiting to go ( yes i know the recommendation is to not do it this way around but one has to sometimes ).
neutral	as i really liked them and didn_'_t want the hassle of sending them back , i tried the old trick of rubbing the teeth of the zip with a candle which seems to have worked ( for now , anyway !).
negative	i have been using aol for many many_years but will never use them again and will advise others not to .
negative	why you ask ?
neutral	so , i '_m stood in the freezing_cold waiting for a bus ( having finally found the right stop just in time to see one depart ), and phoned rentalcars .

positive	the quality of the brushes were fantastic and i will_definately be ordering from here again .
neutral	i emailed them 0_days ago , took them today to answer .
negative	when bride_& groom customer_services were contacted , they appeared to have no idea why items had not been delivered , but then promised next_day delivery , which did not happen .
positive	website was easy to use , checkout simple .
negative	so you would rather prioritise a potential sale for someone to my firm order - amazing !

positive	i decided to order a memory_foam topper and after_searching the net found zleeps to be the cheapest .
neutral	when talikng to customer service trying to solve it , lady was very rude and unhelpful .
positive	they have a user_friendly website which is easy to navigate to your area of interest .
positive	we only had to wait a matter of minutes on arriving at sentinal , to be whipped away to the terminal . excellent .
negative	it '_s good to see that they are making lots of money and i think this is evident from the massive and no doubt costly company rebrand exercise .
neutral	en revanche , ils viennent de changer de service de_livraison .
negative	the item was listed on the site but after 0 days i had received nothing .
negative	so_far i have not received anything
negative	talk_talk let you call them on their premium helpline number and inform you that you are now on a monthly_contract .

positive	hiring a " professional " cleaner costs per day what i paid for my very own carpet_cleaner .

positive	thank_you
neutral	there '_s a good range of products and secure methods of paymen but the preparation for post and packaging then delivery of the goods can be a w bit_slow .

neutral	i chose small cards and would have preferred the ' cardtown ' logo to be appropriately smaller , less obtrusive and also to be left off the envelope .
negative	now the weather you cannot do anything about , however , information and customer service , that is another matter .
neutral	i was really impressed with the drop box delivery service , easy and convienient .
negative	the chair arrived but they did not inform_me that the desk was out of stock .
negative	the site navigation and layout if beyond bad .

positive	i had a great experience buying my prom_dress .
negative	having rearranged a whole day to receive delivery after receiving a text saying it would be delivered today ( no time frame whatsoever ) i contacted them on an 0000 number , which is now not supposed to be used legally for after - sales or customer service , to be told that they could only tell me " sometime before 0pm " unless i call back after 00 .
negative	when i complained to customer_services about their reply and repeated my desire to get a refund i didn_'_t even get a response back .
negative	dreadful !!!!
neutral	you could lose customers .
neutral	quick service though and arrived_safely .
negative	the cars are cheap and the service is awful they advertise things that are not on the car . you pick the car up nobody takes you around the car to explain how things work all they say is if you drive it away its your problem .
negative	i will never use this web_site or florist again unless i get a refund !
negative	they made a mistake to be condescending to us as i shall_continue to point out the truth : tesco thing that they are the big cheese but their bad customer service already made them to forget to go into the french market and they had to quit the us market : i wonder_why . not .
positive	driver gave_me a big_smile when i greeted him at the gateway .
neutral	this annoys_me because i specifically_requested that the delivery person knock_loudly and wait a long time as the lady in question is 00 and takes a long time to get the door .

neutral	i then googled hammonds customer reviews – so many complaints along similar lines .

positive	i have been buying from crocus for some years_now , i have read some of the other more negative_reviews and can '_t_believe this is the same company !

negative	never again !
positive	ordered a white weeping_cherry for my dad '_s birthday - very helpful on the phone and the tree arrived_safely on the day i was expecting it .
negative	that '_s how seriously they treat their customer service !

neutral	postage_costs seemed ok .
neutral	when i contacted them , they answered straight_away , but only offered refund and said they can '_t send missing items as don_'_t have packaging small enough ?!?
neutral	coming_back we found we had to pay the parking ( not had that before ) and we didn_'_t know and had no english money to hand , so we had to unpack a case by the barrier to find some coins .
positive	great staff

positive	standard pricing for items sold , great delivery speeds and never ad an issue
negative	as i said , i did not know it was a two year contract as they never mentioned it at all .
positive	your phone and value , simple click order request form and envelope ,

negative	they said it would take around 00 days to get my phone repaired and sent back to me .
negative	i ordered an offfice chair and desk for my new office .
neutral	whilst i appreciate that the fault lies with the courier company , rather_than directly with my tuxedo , their attitude and poor levels of service does leave a negative impression on the whole buying experience .
negative	i arranged an_independent expert inspection to find that the roof was unfit for purpose .
negative	given the cost of this i would never purchase anything from escapade again as i now have to get a new zip fitted .
negative	so i agreed to the free upgrade and only towards the end of the call did he say that my contract would be extended for a further 00 months .

positive	plenty of opportunity to change that slot if it had not been convenient
neutral	what was i supposed to do ?
positive	was looking for simple tv remote for my mother in - law .
neutral	when the item was in stock i received an email_telling_me that it would be delivered monday 00 january , it also had a tracking_link .
positive	thanks so much .
neutral	i ordered a pair of aigle clogs size 0 . 0 for my son and they arrived promptly .
positive	flashbay came up and we made contact , jeremy immediately understood our needs and even better could meet an incredibly tight_deadline .
positive	they do exactly_what they say on the tin !
positive	more than just a retailer , this is a broad and well rounded company which offers first_class service on many levels .
positive	easy to use service .
positive	i would recommend hlc to a friend , i am_glad i enrolled and am looking_forward to my new career in digital_marketing .
positive	the web_site was easy to manage , i am a little long in the tooth , and the item arrived within three_days .
negative	* i telephoned them late_afternoon on their 0000 number ( presumably expensive , but the cost isn_'_t show on their website and they don_'_t offer a " local " rate or 0000 free rate call ).
neutral	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
positive	i was dealing_with zoe in their fabrication team who was always happy and polite to change my measurements either on the phone or via_email .
neutral	would like to know what percentage of people are able to return a car completely empty .
positive	the products are brilliant and so reasonably_priced .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my products , and they have only answered my first out of three e_-_mails , yet .
negative	today i called interparcel as we are fed_up with the failed collection and they said i quote ' it is not guaranteed that the driver will quote the ref although we scan these instructions to them ' .
positive	i can only say thank_you for your prompt service
negative	my next action will be to contact my bank to reverse the charge ( which they had no_problems taking immediately ).
positive	unimpressed with the selection & prices at several high_street well_known names , i found mytuxedo online and was very impressed with the selection and prices offered by them .
negative	obviously this is a customer fault & vodafone can do absolutely nothing to assist .
negative	promised work would begin next week .
positive	bed came very quick and left_outside as i '_d asked and parcel had note on it with this info - very impressed with service and bed .
negative	i emailed them a week_later to ask whether it had been sent , saying i ' d heard_nothing .
negative	!
negative	poor quality goods , missing and damaged items .
positive	i will definitely use this company again .
negative	i order this type specially so that they didn_'_t have to go in a vase !
negative	the only_reason they have 0_star is because you cant leave a review without leaving at_least 0_star otherwise it would be - 0
positive	very happy ," because life isn_'_t always smooth ".
neutral	it should also be made very clear up front as i was going to ask someone very wealthy and rich who has taken early retirement so does not have a payslip , good job i did not .
neutral	the interior was dirty and there was rubbish in glove_box and storage places .
neutral	very dissapointing as the free inclusion of the sniper challenge is what made me go for this offer in the first place .
negative	called just - eat - who reassured me it wasnt my fault !!!!
positive	very satisfied with mr . memory .
negative	i work for a big national company andi would never be allowed to speak to a customerlike that in an email and even on the basis of goodwill alone would have refunded the money to keep a longstanding_customer happy
negative	as you know it is not what someone says but how they say it .
negative	be warned , bensons say a two inch dip where you sleep is perfectly normal and to be expected .
positive	i would recommend your service to other pet_owners .
neutral	the only problems seems to be lack of stock and chosen stores so sometimes when ordering a few items you cannot get them all from same store which is not good as they only hold reserved items until end of the next_day and if you have to wait for another item to come_back into stock it means going back to collect !
neutral	i ordered the 00 red_roses for my wife as a gift for our first wedding_anniversary .
positive	00 / 00
neutral	the wellies i received are too large , so sizing is a real issue here .
neutral	the other thing is that the delivery starts at £ 0 + which for an item of £_00 + is virtually 00_% and makes the whole point of buying online pretty worthless .
neutral	was in two_minds whether to ring up and complain and still_haven_'_t - but this review has allowed me to at_least voice an opinion .
neutral	luckily it worked first time so i thought i ' d keep it .
positive	great prices , excellent delivery times , love being sble to choose time and date to suit me .
positive	sent phone one day and got cheque the day after .
negative	so i got setback for a super shitty car like vw_polo by 000 € plus the 00 £ i paid already .
negative	to rub salt into the would i was offered a £_00 discount_voucher to be used on my next oreder .
neutral	ordered ( garmin glo gps receiver , £_00 ), then 0 days_later received email to say not in stock , and then another email to say further delay getting stock .
neutral	pleased with free stuff for 0st time .
positive	like it says .
positive	great food , and choice will reccommend
positive	the price of the worktops is very competitive , and i think this swung me in favour of wood , rather_than a man - made surface - and also our previous experience of having a laminate - style worktop .
positive	if we had any requirements in future , we would definitely order again .
positive	the pupils are usually nearer to the tutor and therefore making transport easier .
positive	now i am saving up for some of their goose_down pillows !
neutral	for the price i was expecting more .
negative	like all insurance companies they are really evil incarnate .
positive	this is coupled_with a very fast and reliable delivery .
neutral	0_stars this time .
positive	mark
negative	cannot say how good or bad the product is that i purchased , as i have not opened it yet .
negative	how about offering another one of your customers enjoying a holiday in london alternative_accommodation in birmingham and see how they respond .
neutral	not impressed with overall service ; doubtful that i will make any future_purchases .
positive	thank_you .
positive	!
positive	returned as per instructions in parcel on the wednesday .
positive	excellent service even down to the packaging .
negative	then told me they will probably never be able to deliver my goods .
negative	i have recently signed_up for wowcher , as i saw a good deal and thought why not ?
neutral	i have been on the diet for two_weeks and have had to throw_away two of the dinners .
negative	sold goods which apparently they didnt have refunded me months later and when sent them damaged shoes they didnt even bother to look at them .
negative	i am not satisfied at all with the service i have received for this purchase .
neutral	lesson - read the fine print .
positive	with my fencing i received the nails and a pot of jackure which is used to treat the places where cutting or drilling is necessary , using this also keeps up your 00 year_guarantee !
positive	i particularly needed kosher products -- you may want to do a bit of research , as more things are kosher than you are listing .
negative	so many big chain companies have fallen recently , how are bhs not one of them .
negative	i didn_'_t repost it immediately as you asked i give you the benefit of the doubt .
positive	excellent !
negative	absolutely the worst ever service , from customer service to no service , several complaints resolved in aparently no line faults , then an engineer came round and confirmed there were several , up to 00 times in one min . after trying to make them understand , that they had charged me more than i signed_up for after two months of incorrect bills , and many calls from the mobile , for which they had the number , said i was not entitled to compensation for the costs .
negative	the package has_been dispatched two months_ago , until now i '_ve never received a word from it .
neutral	dreams said they had tried to call but we had given them the wrong number with one too many digits on it .
negative	never again !!
negative	really liked the range of products that snowinn had , particularly in comparison to competitors .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 customers name is gave name , i have been so let_down and messed about its unbelievable !
positive	they paid the money in straight after they tested the mobile .
neutral	we went in april so it wasn_'_t too hot in the car_park .
negative	i was so disgruntled by this i sent an email to the ceo outlining these cases on 00 november .
negative	the rental_agreement was never fulfilled .
negative	only response when trying to contact them is that my refund request ' has_been passed to the appropriate person '.
positive	arrived so quickly too .
positive	chris b ( staffordshire )
positive	speed of postage was excellent - especially for time of year
negative	according to the dfs brentford i was lying and didn_'_t pay when i was telling the truth !!!
neutral	i ' d probably order again from the company in future though if these issues were resolved as my order came very quickly and the price is obviously a good saving .
negative	i then got bills from my old electricity and gas suppliers .
negative	basically the courier decided to leave my box on my " porch " i live next to a busy pathway and when i got home item was not there .
positive	as we live on a farm it still left him unable to get any essential exercise .
negative	i sat all morning staring_at my front_door with my dog sat at the window ready to shout to tell me the man was at the door .
negative	which – to their credit , we received .
positive	a brilliant company who have excellent service - they always answer the phone and can help asap - and know their products inside out .
neutral	some communication is better_than none at all !!!
neutral	not a bad_experience , just a little complicated .
neutral	pity the admin isn_'_t as good as the product !!
positive	service was prompt and the goods we ordered were as they had been described and all in working order .
neutral	i then got another email from liberro giving me another discount_voucher_code , so this time i went in and placed an order and when checking out entered the voucher number as emailed to me , however i was advised online that the voucher was not valid !
positive	i contacted tom_holland who immediately resolved the issue and offered to pay return postage to change the strap .
neutral	customer code 00000 00 - 00 - 0000
negative	!
neutral	overall would have preferred to have given my £_000 to a local_independent store who could offer more care in the first_instance .
neutral	i can '_t even remember how long ago it was ( estimate is a 00 - 00months ) that i made the purchase that came with the cashback or who the vendor was , i think it was experian .
neutral	delivered quickly but marks on the cajon make me think this has already been used .
negative	at_least i know my poor experience wasn_'_t isolated , although i do feel for anyone unlucky_enough to have suffered at the hands of futeko '_s petulant customer service .
negative	so if you want your items delivered in the street , by all means !
neutral	they did refund the £_00 but in turn i missed half a days work waiting for it .
positive	very pleasurable_experience
neutral	with the amount of suppliers online , won_'_t be using this company for this product again .
negative	00hrs came and went and as the recipient had now gone on holiday for 0_weeks , i called collect_+ and i asked for the parcels to be returned to me and asked for a refund of the shipping_costs i had already paid .
positive	best prices given and a really quick_turnaround
negative	no attempt by the company to resolve so i will definitely resort to legal_action if they don_'_t sort it by the date i have given them .
neutral	luckily i didn_'_t need it immediately .
neutral	unfortunately i think the lifespan will not meet expectations .
positive	bought a pair of running_shoes the same as my current pair for about two_thirds the price and some nutrition for about half price .
positive	i checked out the website and finally decided to give it a try .
negative	day one , was sent an email_stating delivery window of 0000 - 0000 .
neutral	prices seem to have increased and no_longer beat other online_retailers ( often more_expensive ).
negative	will not be up until tue 0nd_april .
positive	i '_ve been replacing the missing cards in a collection of old magic decks and the magicmadhouse website is a great resource for identifying just the right cards to fill the gaps , right down to particular designs on individual land cards .
neutral	i uploaded my picture and proceeded through the process , continuing to paypal and paying for shopping . waited for order to arrive but . nothing !
negative	terrible service , i always try to buy from independents oppose to the monopolies such as amazon , but the service is just not there !
positive	unbelievably quick !
neutral	'_m not happy about what i wrote on questions into order message only say thank_you for ordering where ask my question
negative	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally_ignored too .
negative	when i click the unsubscribe link , the server cannot be found .
neutral	sadly that is no_longer the case , they now have a central call_centre which is very frustrating to use at best , bordering on intolerable at worst .
neutral	but anyway , i can see the pressure the company is under and i won_'_t lose any sleep over that .
positive	the person i spoke to was so helpful , and informative .
neutral	if the size of the range_rover had been taken into account on the first visit and i had been asked to take it into the centre at that time i would have considered the service to be very good , as it was i was left_feeling frustrated .
neutral	when asking for the tracking_numbers haven_'_t been given the information until the replacement orders have been sent , not good when this diet is supposed to keep you in ketosis , also some items i '_ve had only had 0_weeks or so until they became out of date and other items they covered the date label with a sticker , so not really that impressed with them .
positive	delivery arrived well , totaly as expected
positive	it was hassle_free from_start to finish and would recommend .
negative	i suggested that we could exchange when replacement delivered our courier only delivers they do not collect .
neutral	dont_know who does quality control on these rads but when blanks opened to receive rad valves edges on inside bit rough ie not smooth so need extra attention to prevent weeping . this should not happen on what is purported to be a quality item
negative	very rude customer service
neutral	i emailed to express my disappointment and the response was a little scathing although i was told eamonn would be in touch .
negative	fortunately , after raising the issue with paypal the payment has_been refunded .
negative	may 0th : i '_ve emailed them asking if there is any news on the item i ordered in march ( two_days delivery )!
negative	so let '_s say your trusty big freezer is finally giving up after 00 years and as it '_s warm out there you need a replacement quickly .
positive	this version was older stock so
neutral	i recently_purchased some titleist dt solo golf_balls .
positive	value for money , competitive_pricing . one of the fastest free of charge deliveries on the web .
neutral	they added it to the credit_card when adding the tank of fuel .
positive	i ordered a marie_curie product and liked the idea that a percentage of the price would go to that charity .
negative	i placed this order with you on the basis that you delivered on 00th_march .
neutral	it '_s really great .
negative	took_advantage of a ' 0 for 0 ' on tops offer , only came to £_00 total for 0 tops . oh plus £ 0 . 00 delivery . only 0 tops came as the other was out of stock . two_weeks_later the other top turned_up , charged me another £ 0 . 00 for delivery and tried to charge me another £ 0 for the top , argued it and they knocked the £ 0 off like they should ( esp as the promotion is still running !)
negative	finally agreed to refund my money , refused compensation and again offered discount on future order .
negative	informed delivery date , but any time from 0 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
negative	we were so badly_let_down by this company that it almost cost us our own business .
negative	after paying £_00 for next_day delivery and order it to my work address so i wouldn_'_t have to miss a day of work , nothing shows up .
positive	cheaper_than most and delivery is fantastic , my orders have always , and i mean always , turned_up the very next_day , morning post even if i have not ordered on line before 0pm .
negative	delivery day comes and no sofa .
neutral	i would definitely recommend using cex for buying and selling .
neutral	wrong goods still_waiting for replacement ?
neutral	excellent quick , reliable service but have been told that while the flowers are very pretty , the bunch is very small .
positive	my photobooks are always of a high_standard with prompt delivery and usually under some sort of offer so at a good price .
neutral	its good for a few smaller parcels or the occasional large parcel , but i can see that there are limits on large_quantities .
negative	only after opening a dispute via_paypal did they respond asking me to wait another two_weeks !
negative	rang to cancel and was told it wouldn_'_t be a problem .
positive	arrived very quickly and goods exactly as_described .
positive	helmet was dispatched and delivered within 00_hours of order .
positive	excellent service .
negative	the rest of the staff were sympathetic and agreed that they would feel upset if they had been mal - informed .
neutral	i perhaps wrongly , assumed the number_plate recognition allowed_me to go straight to the barrier when leaving the car_park and insert my ticket with my reg_number on it .
negative	my wife tendered the correct amount in notes and made an unforgivable error in handing the sweet lady a non euro coin from her collection of euros , litas or polish money .
negative	the website stated that it takes an_hour to put_together .
neutral	it is also not a quick job - it took me an_hour to assemble 0 x 0 shelf_units .
positive	and perfect for us students that have phones laying_around and need a bit of extra money !
neutral	however , the box of goodies was delivered to australia quickly and safely despite it being christmas time and my friend was delighted to recieve her good old british favourites . so it was worth the effort !
negative	it '_s not worth with the stress and hassle when things go_wrong , and it will go_wrong .
neutral	i got the impression you could choose your date .
negative	time running out , no refund and i notice the increase in shill reviews
neutral	the same size silhouette can be purchased for £_00 . 00 at most garden_centres
neutral	good price but cannot wait a week for first_aid bits .
positive	thank_you to the sleep room for being so prompt with processing my order and quick delivery
negative	i was advised i should get maybe sometime this week .
negative	i will be taking my custom elsewhere .
neutral	will i shop there again ?
neutral	the packaging was flimsy .
positive	it was fantastic .
neutral	there has certainly been no friction , but how can one give more stars on such scanty experience ?
neutral	handlebars incorrect , tyres incorrect , alternative rims / wheels supplied look terrible compared to the original dt swiss .
negative	members of family party booked resorthoppa for transfers from bodrum airport to turgutreis ( large resort about 0_hr from airport ).
negative	this is why i decided to change to plusnet ( great service ).
positive	it '_s literally free money .
negative	steer_clear of this company .
neutral	we bought a brand_new nissan_note tekna from chorley_nissan blackpool on the 0nd june .
negative	i was first told this would be replaced but then received the most disgusting email from them calling me irresponsible and pretty_much telling_me it was my fault the food was mouldy and that i couldnt prove otherwise ( my consumer_rights state that i do not have to prove it was fault0 ).
neutral	the only potential area for improvement is the service offered through 0rd_party vendors .
positive	the only places i could_find them was in america and japan but then i found taunton_leisure online .
negative	the most i tried was 00 times in one working day between office hours ( please disregard that statement if you want to but i have no motive to mislead and just a genuine intention of not letting others lose their hard earn '_t ) i contacted wowcher - they responded by forwarding an_email - still unable to get through to redeem my voucher i contacted customer_services again and was informed that i could only claim back 00_% of the amount i paid and that would be in wowcher credit ( if i understood correctly this credit also has a time limit ) i have been unable to redeem 0 vouchers before but it has not ended quite so expensively . i would also like to state that out of the vouchers purchased before we had a caravan break planned that was cancelled days before we were due to go away and a meal in london with friends that the restaurant cancelled a couple of hours before the reservation time !
neutral	the quality of the on - board service varies from excellent to appalling , depending_on who is in the team .
positive	recommended
negative	after a week of putting up with the screen flicking issue i had the same problem with restarting phone and i took it to my local_store in lewisham .
negative	thanks , for your reply lindsay .
positive	!
neutral	positioned it where i saw a mouse but so far no evidence even of tiny nibbles !
positive	if you need glasses go here
positive	very pleased with the order it was exactly as promised on the website .
negative	this is an absolutely awful company , who lies and does not keep to promises and has no urgency whatsoever about them .
positive	their service is amazing , the speeds are always great , the customer service is amazing .
neutral	i was notified of the delivery day and time !
positive	the mr_memory website makes choosing memory_upgrades trivially simple .
positive	quick and reliable service .
negative	those frames are also discontinued .
negative	didn_'_t turn_up within time took 00 weeks .
negative	there is a glowing write up in their brochure for polycarbonate sheeting but no mention of how long the material should last .
neutral	i '_m quite disappointed with how this was dealt_with and although i will be encouraging both of my children to attend camp again next summer - i don_'_t think that my son will want to go again :-(
neutral	you may get free delivery but expect an increased item price .
positive	this is the second time that i '_ve_used appliances_online .
positive	ulumi .
neutral	the chap_who delivered the car must have been aware of the problem as it turned_out a brake lining was missing from the brake_pad - sounds dangerous but i have mechanical experience and was able to get the car back to the office without problems .
positive	hiring a lens is a great way to use your dream lens at a fraction of the cost and enjoy the rewards of fantastic photo '_s .
neutral	i called 000 and was told , " oh , that '_s easy : you need to give us 00 days written notice so all you need to do is go to our website , click this link and then that link and state that you ' d like to cancel the lines .
positive	thank_you , thanks to the driver who delivered who must .
neutral	i ordered the 0 - seater futon and struggled to put it together .
negative	i then paid for my items and waited for the order confirmation .
neutral	the item i ordered was part of a margarita gift set we were giving as a wedding present .
positive	faultless .
positive	clubs were delivered on time with no problem .
neutral	i have contacted several_times with dhl_express here in madrid and we have specify a delivery schedule and they don_'_t deliver me the item .
neutral	sadly this time though , the black 000 one has_been o . k .
negative	you ' re likely to find a better deal elsewhere online .
neutral	when finally uploading the epc my ad was suppose to go active soon but i had to chase them up as it seems they forgot causing delay in finding tenants .
negative	i then emailed them to enquire but no response .
negative	technical help didn_'_t call back when they said they would and their was no understanding or sympathy .
negative	i will buy a replacement rail from argos and avoid both very and yodel like plague .
negative	a totally shocking and disgraceful experience .
neutral	poor delivery plus delivery team not the dates agreed in showroom
neutral	only one bottle of nail_polish arrived , with no explanation as to why one was missing .
positive	we were upgraded to three fiat_000l cars red , dark_grey and silver .
positive	the staff at stonacre didn_'_t bother us when we told them we were just looking and would ask for help if required .
negative	absolutely awful service .
neutral	£_00 every 00 / 00 months works out expensive .
positive	have used gg several_times , including online purchase and delivery of schecter 0 string .

negative	i ordered flower delivery 0_days in_advance of delivery date through eflorist for my aunt '_s 00th_birthday in ireland .
negative	i phoned in after about a week , and was told it was on its way !
neutral	the range of payment options is good too .
neutral	i wont_be ordering of them again as i ordered the wrong_size and when trying tyo send back they said they dont do returns the mad thing is i had to order the right size so they could have picked the wrong one up when they dropped the new one off at no cost to them .
negative	however , when it comes to continuity of customer service .?
negative	will go to amazon or ebay for future_purchases .
neutral	eventually the order was sent out by royal_mail express delivery and arrived within 00_hours .
negative	i was also very surprised at how small the bunch was .
neutral	the table needs telescopic locking legs with at_least 00cm range .
negative	surprised ee was voted worst mobile provider off 0000 . really angry .
neutral	the repair took a week but other than that great .
negative	we ' re still_waiting to see if they actually come_back again - some very poor communication in this company .
neutral	i have heard the same from a couple good friends .
neutral	!
neutral	a surprise party was being thrown for my grandmother and arrangements for her to be collected from her home had been made for 00 :_00pm ; hence the 00 :_00pm delivery requirement .
negative	in the end , i cancelled my order and placed a new order with dartington_glass direct .
negative	i ordered dog boots and stag bars in february .
neutral	this means that at the moment , we are turning the pages with delicate care .
negative	however , when i disputed this with head_office it took a very long time to get back to me about what they were going do .
neutral	i recent ordered two_pairs of glasses .
neutral	this was acknowledged and an_apology given .
negative	i have now been contacted my numerous other ultimate appliance customers who all have similar stories to tell .

neutral	despite this i persevered and the product was delivered speedily .
negative	' it '_s in the terms and conditions ' was the reply .
positive	i was very very impressed with the speed with which my order was dealt_with and delivered , and also at a price which no chemist or vet in my area can begin to compete with .
negative	spoke a one of your ladies and told her about the email i received and she says you don_'_t request saturday deliveries ; that '_s great but the email states something very different !
negative	i ordered a pair of spectacles which proved to be of weak and substandard construction - they broke whilst i was putting them on within a week or two of use .
positive	i have rated incrystals earlier this month , and the service only keeps getting better !
positive	mike
negative	will take the advice of cancelling any direct_debits - even_though i have never had service .
negative	when the order arrived i had gone out for 0 hour and was left a note telling_me i '_d missed them and to rearrange another time .
negative	how can they just give 00_mins notice ?
neutral	however , i raised again the issue of the marks on the paintwork .
negative	but i was never able to get_hold of either of these people , so i after 0_months i have lost my £_000 .
negative	item ( an sds_drill ) arrived with inadequate and torn packaging .
neutral	car was delivered to and collected from our villa at the times requested .
negative	stay well clear of this company !
negative	it is now over 00 days since the transaction and i am still without my refund , if this had occurred with my bank or credit_card company the monies would have been refunded straight_away .
positive	my straightners were delivered in under 00_hours - thank_you !
positive	the hotel has 0 restaurants , the main one always serves buffet style food with wide and varied_selection .
positive	we did all the checks etc ourselves so can '_t comment on this side of their service but we would definitely use them again .
neutral	the receipt came from google_checkout not simply_electronics .
neutral	the colour of the tissue_paper was a lot brighter than appeared on screen .
neutral	i accept this as an error on our part but having no direct experience of pay methods in the less developed economies it would be nice if world_remit gave a little info , and clarity on irreversibility on payment types we ' re not familiar with .
negative	my wife and i were looking for a nintendo dsi for our daughter '_s birthday and found this site .
negative	single rosé on a vase , was for my anniversary and the vase was broken wasn_'_t really happy when i heard this from my partner , 0st time used this service and will be the last

neutral	buy same product from my local pizza house for a third of the price
positive	i sent off the phones and within 0_days i had £_00 .
neutral	instructions were vague and misleading .
neutral	on the day the engineer arrived promptly and was well - presented .
negative	oh !
negative	in terms of pricing , we found icuk to be slightly more_expensive than other similarly sized isps due to their tiered bandwidth pricing .
negative	!
positive	i chose np_autoparts mainly_because they were cheaper and offered free p_&_p .
positive	i spoke to sarah_hayes who was very polite and had excellent customer service .
neutral	returned it to the local_branch who had it a couple of weeks then got a call to collect it .
positive	after 0 - 0 days i got an email from amazon apologising but saying the product wouldn_'_t be available for up to 0 month with a 0week window for delivery .

neutral	packing in a box would be better as these are supposedly more_expensive items of clothing .
positive	i decided on a friday_morning to send my poorly sister some flowers .
neutral	tried to buy the bbq in store but although it said they had 0 in stock they didn_'_t have any except the 0 on show .

positive	i bought a graco contour electra black travel_cot for my grandaughter , it is so good it does everything !
neutral	well , ordering the tyres is simple enough but i will not know what they are like or what the service is like until they are fitted .
positive	i need not have worried , bought orlando passport tickets , great price , great customer service and quick delivery 0_days ( standard signed for ) yes the seaworld / busch / aquatica is an eticket but having been a few_times before its not a problem going to guest services to swap them for cardboard tickets , ( if you prefer them ), as the queues there are never that long .
positive	thank_you and well_done !
positive	that said i would recommend this site .
negative	i ended_up buying from amazon at a later date and given him the knife as a token gift , even_though completely_useless .

negative	i have used partyrama before and had no_problems ; however this time was a totally different_story .
positive	also highly_recommended !
positive	sainsbury '_s is the closest one to that mark , the online ordering and delivery service is 00_% foolproof , although i do find i have to switch off the substitutes as some of the replacements are questionable .
positive	thank_you so much
positive	brilliant company to deal with , kept me informed of the status of my goods every_step of the way .
positive	what more can you ask ?
positive	sent phones on thursday and cheque arrived for full_amount on following_tuesday .
neutral	had i looked at the german company before booking i would have seen the train transfers where included and for peace of mind booked through them
positive	i was looking for medication from a site who offered same day despatch and next_day delivery .
neutral	wouldn_'_t let_me withdraw the 00p .
neutral	on saturday_morning i noticed 0 key bolts from the fence posts hadn_'_t been put in .
neutral	all of these things should have been put in on top of canned goods .
negative	or they might have misplaced it , or so on .
positive	the best in money transferring .
positive	received the order within 0_days .
neutral	otherwise product as_described .
neutral	after_placing my order , to ensure the correct meds had been purchased and payment received i tried for two_days to contact customer_services to confirm the order but the phones were not answered once .
positive	the frying_pan is very heavy and so well_constructed , the knife_block very heavy ( although some wood shavings were blocking some of the slits , which needed to be cleaned out - poor inspection methinks ).
neutral	bought two_pairs , single_vision were great , sadly the varifocals have such a small area that i can focus through , they are useless .
neutral	the only real downside on this trip was the hotel_room , which was in the basement area and close to am area where staff worked , hence early morning noise .
neutral	we arrived at the compound at the appointed time , very early in the morning , to find it open , unsecured and completely deserted .
negative	phoning around_midday they said my flights had been cancelled - still with no clear explanation .
neutral	knowing this would be missed on cursory inspection upon_receipt
negative	i don_'_t think i shall be using again
positive	the lady lyn i spoke to was very friendly and helpful and made me feel at ease .
positive	no_fuss - quick despatch - good prices - would definitely use battery_force again .
negative	however , on picking_up the car from hertz i was told i was not on the electoral role so could not take the car .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t have been a problem if they were not fabric sleeping_bags which now has a dirty stain that won_'_t come out !
neutral	ivor
neutral	when i saw it i was deeply disappointed ( so was she ), as it was largely dark colours , andd not at all cheerful .
positive	excellent to deal with alexander made it so simple no_hidden_costs will be back deal again soon .
negative	communication from the guy running it was awful , never calls back and refused to give me a refund .
negative	after_speaking to your helpline yesterday_afternoon i spoke to a women at bower & bailey .
neutral	car parking good and accessible
negative	imagine the disappointment when our initial inspection revealed a mayjor crack on the underside of the table .
positive	partyrama had a great choice of items at reasonable_prices .
neutral	but all in all a good service .
negative	this was news to me as no card was left .
positive	but good news ; the hose ordered was not available so a better quality alternative was quickly despatched at no extra_cost .
neutral	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately . often the products are wrong , aren_'_t included , wrong sizes etc .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
positive	well_packaged products .
negative	they offer you a " guaranteed fitting slot ", and then can '_t get the tyres delivered to the fitting_station in time ( despite having two_days to get them there ).
negative	my husband bought me some underwear from figleaves for christmas .
positive	excellent service would definitely use again .
positive	i see you have a fine selection of malts and i have been very satisfied with your prompt , easy to deal with approach and i shall_certainly be buying from you again .
neutral	it would be good to have a dedicated area for prepaid cars .
negative	virgin please take_note , as i won_'_t be re - newing my phone with you in future if you insist on using yodel , yodel !!
neutral	beautybay has good prices overall , but it takes loooong time to get the delivery .
neutral	they just said they are discontinued and that was it
neutral	i didn_'_t get what i paid for in terms of delivery .
positive	thank_you very much
negative	apparently this is common with very nowadays and i wish i had researched before - i used to a be littlewoods ( as they used to be called ) customer many_years_ago , no_problems then .
neutral	!
positive	i would not_hesitate to use them again .
positive	i am very impressed - brilliant service , thank and well_done .
positive	my son was also happy as he got the cologne that he_likes , and had a bit extra spent on his other presents .
positive	i used park_cameras as their deal for the printer i was looking for was the best value on the web .
neutral	unfortunately it had not arrived 00 working_days_later , despite standard delivery being described as " within 0 working_days ".
positive	which is a huge help when you have a million other things going on during the build and you want to get all of them just right .
negative	stay_away from these !
neutral	just as well nothing was breakable .
negative	then charged me for leaving them - avoid at all costs , call_centres abroad and cant understand a word you say then get passed from one person to another and problem still not sorted
positive	the tree was stunning .
negative	we ordered the goods on a tuesday , next_day delivery ready for a party that was on the saturday .
neutral	some parts missing but got on to helpline and they sorted it straight_away .
neutral	parking_spaces for motorbikes which was great .
neutral	my guarantor was less_than impressed that he had to call in himself and wait for ages , i think really amigo should have called him .
negative	i received the item nearly 0_weeks after order placed .
negative	sorry greenpod , such awful service for you will mean i never order from you again .
neutral	we were not expecting the to have to put_together the sofa and chair at no point were we told that they come flat_pack some people would not be able to manage the assembly or packaging and amount of cardboard , it states that all returns should be in the delivery boxes but how could people store the stuff it filled my estate car .
neutral	product great but delivery not great .
negative	!
neutral	good delivery and price but if the topcash_back scheme is not going to be complied with , why should you be allowed to advertise as a member of topcash_back ?
negative	the lady_who informed me of this system , seemed quite indignant when i commented that it was the most ridiculous non working / waste of time system ever !
neutral	ordered epiphone ukulele and belcat 00w slim amp on monday and tracked until thursday when they said that they had tried to deliver but they hadn_'_t so after several phone_calls to yodel they managed to phone their driver who was in next village so arranged to meet at coop to pick_up package ( never really wanted to be a courier ) his excuse was that his sat_nav sent him wrong . any way product is good although it came without pick guard and amp was not slim one as ordered ( but not worried_about this .) i would recommend this firm as i think courier was at fault .
negative	0_weeks_later , after arguing my case and informing asos that i wanted to return the dress , i have been issued a full_refund and it was agreed that asos would send a courier to pick_up the dress .
positive	i enjoy shopping with pet_supermarket .
positive	i have never used maxram before , but found the service very efficient and speedy .
negative	the box and router arrived lunchtime on 0th_november and my husband connected it that evening .
negative	i challenged this .
positive	in addition they were offering a one off further discount if you entered a promotional_code .
negative	and it would be with me on monday 00th .
negative	please let_me know when ro expext my order !
negative	i have never used this service before as i have stopped wearing_contacts a while ago .
negative	hello !
negative	they are actually the worst company i ever dealt_with .
neutral	no sleep most nights if you are a normal sleeper or have kids .
neutral	no call was received , so today i called homebase online number .
positive	it looks fantastic and the quality is amazing .
negative	det_er desværre ikke første gang , at jeg_har haft problemer_med telenor .
neutral	trying to sort_out by the website was very time_consuming as they required scans of tickets etc , fine if you have a scanner !
neutral	it seems a shame that this mistake was not proof_read and it is extremely rare to find errors like this in catalogues , a bit unprofessional .
negative	despite the road name being clearly_marked , the driver didn_'_t even bother to go down the road named , but decided he knew better and attempted to deliver to a different building , which was locked up .
positive	just spent the night in the west_end , life was made very easy with the hotel so close to the theatre , we had a very enjoyable and relaxing time .
positive	they have some of the best customer service i '_ve ever used , and they ' re very quick at replying .
positive	still need a retro_style cream fridge_freezer and hoping they may in the future stock the ones made in slovenia which have a 0 year guaranteee .
negative	as you would imagine , buying process could become more complicated with extra parties_involved .
neutral	lack of del instructions no del time & no tracking no .
neutral	the items i bought were quite low value and i have seen larger items on worldstores that look really nice .
positive	great speedy service - returned item promptly onto card - recommended
positive	previous review : 00 june_0000
positive	the costume was delivered very quickly i was given an_hour time_slot that i was told via_text_message .
neutral	got an exchange pair in bigger_size very quickly , but they were not the colour i ordered - i kept them as didn_'_t want to fork_out further postage payments !
negative	just read all the other reviews on them .
positive	i have placed many orders with chemist_direct and they have all arrived extremley promptly .
negative	i was told this wasnt possible , i stated the person is going on holiday and wont be in !!
positive	a great service which i will be using again in the future
neutral	i was happy with an overall quality but unfortunately outer_packaging arrived damaged which affected corners of the book .
negative	when i ordered i ask the woman if the fitting where the same and she said yes and they are not .
positive	i had previously shopped_around with other_companies but had felt a bit_wary as i sensed a pressure from them .
positive	they were indeed delivered as promised the next_day .
negative	after wasting me of my time on the phone to them they sent another courier to collect the parcel .
positive	:)
positive	i '_ll be coming_back for more .
neutral	to my cost i now know why .
positive	everything arrived on time for christmas and packaged well .
positive	will i order from mastershoe again ?
negative	i really regret dealing_with this company - avoid !!
negative	i . e payg phones .
negative	stay_away from them if you are a seller cos you will pay pall !
negative	i will use a local_florist and pay a bit more for something decent .
negative	they say it is usage . i laughed the house down when they told me that but after the laughter came the anger and disgust .
neutral	however the delivery was very dissapointing .
neutral	had a very nice apology stating was a typo , however no mention of delivery to my other address .
positive	choose 000 photos to be included .
negative	it stated had everything with box .
negative	i tried to cancel my contract , but they wouldn_'_t let_me .
neutral	ordering , payment , dispatch and speed of delivery was great but unfortunately the no . 0 sparkler i purchased for my twins 0th_birthday arrived damaged .
negative	i sold 0 phones , one was a year_old and they said it was damaged .
positive	no_probs with transaction or service . many_thanks .
negative	they therefore helpfully offered to redeliver it on monday when i was at work 00 miles_away .
neutral	i was so disappointed as ( in my opinion ) i '_d spent quite a bit on it .
positive	took a punt on using the website as it wasn_'_t one i had heard of before but the fact i could pay via_paypal appealed and it was an excellent decision .
negative	i am so unhappy with the service provided , on the website they advertise free_postage for orders and have a phone number to call for " assistance " but when asking to order over the phone after clarifying the item i wanted they do not give free_postage , and charge you , when i asked why i was told it was because they have to pay the staff to answer the phone .
negative	i would give minus stars but this is not available .
positive	would completely recommend them to anyone and i don_'_t normally_bother_writing_reviews but their service prompted me to .
neutral	this had nothing to do with the lighting because they were of the same picture different pose taken virtually one after the other .
neutral	the car was in the same condition i dropped it off - phew !
neutral	i also emailed thedrinkshop . com at the same time i contacted city_link but got no reply - so they didn_'_t care about my shopping_experience then - why care now ?
negative	i then stayed in till 00 . 00 when i sent myukdelivery another email
positive	phoned for advice and decided to make a booking there and then - now looking_forward to our break !
neutral	they are trying to offer a top_notch product to a skint britain .
neutral	call neverland because that is where they are base .
positive	excellent service from_start to finish .
positive	this company were easy to buy from , everthing_went_smoothly , and delivery was efficient , convenient and on time .
neutral	i found this very poor service on their behalf .
neutral	i thought breakfast was included and it wasn_'_t .
neutral	this alternative worked out to be more_expensive for my overall transaction - but there didnt seem to be a way for me to remove the free delivery and reapply the 00_%_discount !
positive	ordering my lenses was very easy and the delivery as always was first_class .
positive	a fantastic selection of shoes at great prices and also a number of very good offers available also .
positive	chris suggested some alternatives and initially i was not that keen on them .
neutral	overall i would say these_guys are ok for delivering a car - but they are certainly not shy of charging more / getting more money out of you than originally stated .
negative	how_dare you not reply to any of our calls and voicemails .
neutral	but if you order the wrong product , or it gets sent to the wrong_address , you pretty_much have to fend for yourself - not ideal .
negative	wish i had read these awful reviews on here before stepping into fv instead of just being sucked in by a great bed offer .
neutral	you should get a confirmation_email back ; if you don_'_t , you '_ll know it ( the email ) hasn_'_t gone_through properly !"
positive	speedy delivery , great communication and product exactly as_described .
negative	why do they always try to make it seem as though any fault is in one '_s own property even_though it is obvious to a blind man that a wire blowing about in the wind is the fault ?
neutral	the service provided was quick and the colours of the flowers where nice .
neutral	i have since heard from time talk and they have decided to credit me back the £_00 because as they admitted their salesperson had made a mistake in allowing me to believe they would simply pay back the breakage fee .
positive	the staff very quickly realised what was the best options within budget and the bike was available , all built up and ready when i was told it would be .
positive	a pleasure_doing_business wit this company .
neutral	i was a little disappointed because the previous books i have had reproduced very well and now i am very reluctant about having any further crewe albums printed in the future .
negative	i have had to give up as i cannot handle the stress of it .
negative	beware - you may be buying something but if its damaged on delivery ( through no fault of your_own ) then you will not receive it or a replacement just a refund .
negative	i also bought a ‘ new ’ electric_guitar alongside the drum_kit order , only for this to arrive as well in a sorry state – packaging badly_damaged , deep_scratches to the guitar and parts absent .
negative	this was clearly not the case , as i was informed by the attendant that all cars are from the same fleet .
positive	fuming !
negative	this is because - quote from an employer of kwik_fit - they don_'_t inflate it until it is on the car .
neutral	on a long trip it started to rain but when we put the wipers on we realised the tank for the washers was empty which was annoying and points to sloppy care .
negative	next_day no confirmation_email so i called them .
positive	information re stock_levels seems to be accurate .
neutral	the bouquet was smaller than_expected and much small than others that i '_ve had delivered for the same price .
neutral	whilst_travelling to scotland on wednesday 00th_may i received a telephone_call from an e_- florist representative to advise that unfortunately , the exact flower_arrangement i had ordered online were not available .
positive	excellent service and very helpful when i called with a question .
positive	chair arrived very quickly and was easy to assemble .
neutral	tend to book with expedia due to one click ordering .
positive	i have used mazuma couple of times to get_rid of old and non - working mobile_phones and i am very pleased with the quality of service time over time .
negative	ended_up ordering contact_lenses for only my right eye and then discovered they were the wrong lenses as well .
negative	still not delivered and no communication to explain_why .
positive	all_round - excellent . highly_recommended
neutral	so much for them having more on order .
positive	they also provide a great service for queries or extra orders by telephone which is unusual in my experience !
positive	tried weldricks for the first time and am very impressed .
negative	there '_s no way i '_m sending my phone off to them again , i ' d rather visit the local phone repair shop , something i should have done in the first place .
neutral	i was sent an email_stating the day the product would be delivered on .
negative	the good news though is that we ’ ll send you an email to confirm when the refund has_been completed .
neutral	i decided to adapt it and pay another cost so that i could wear the diamond on my wedding day .
negative	it '_s too late to replace them as i have had to rearrange everything to make a window to decorate .
positive	clearly advertised and well communicated .
negative	however i can '_t blame the call_centre staff as its the companies job to install values , ways of working & expectations !!
negative	0 .
negative	but .
positive	only one suggestion , delivery date to be made availble when ordering , ( although my order came very quickly )
positive	the cobra golf_bag , of a particular colour , as seen on their web_site was in stock ( unlike_some other web sites being advertised ) the delivery was delayed by a day but a phone_call to me explaining the reasons was much_appreciated and the bag was delivered 0 days after order .
negative	due to ill_health i cannot currently visit my local_store .
neutral	for sure there has_been a steady decline in the ebay experience compared to five years previous .
positive	: you can '_t see how they look on you !)
neutral	i dont_know but flowers were not fully bloomed , only 0 were fully grown , 0 had to go in bin . i was not over excited .
positive	my parcel was collected the day after the booking and delivered the following_day as promised . i would definitely use them again .
negative	i contacted asos and paypal , and paypal agreed that the seller had to do something about the dress .
positive	they don_'_t have everything but if they '_ve got what you are looking for i bet it will be cheaper .
negative	!
neutral	the 0 % future discount is a bit misleading as you have to join a shopping club to get the voucher - i wouldn_'_t bother !
negative	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
neutral	john
positive	the quality of the flowers is outstanding and the sight of them just blows the recipient away .
positive	the product is good and well priced , the staff are helpful , ordering is easy , items well_packed , and easy to put up .
neutral	not an expert on these sort of sites but it doesn_'_t offend me .
positive	the order had to come in two deliveries , the came as advised and the driver was very helpful placing the radiators in a safe_place as i couldn_'_t lift them .
negative	fotosense which they advertised as being in stock when it was not .
positive	one of the only online_retailers to have the product i was searching for , natureshop provided a great service including a free prepaid_label in case i needed to return the item .
neutral	my flight was fine but booking on your sight was difficult and kept sending me back to my original search but with increased prices .
neutral	the food was fabulous .
positive	quick service and delivery . good quality product
neutral	i ran a taste test making a cup of nespresso ( n ) and fine_coffee_club ( fcc ) coffee and placing the cups next to each other .
negative	city_link asked me to contact them after_reading this review ,
negative	it broke_down again yesterday .
neutral	i ordered two samsung tvs , plus 0d_glasses , back in december 00 .
negative	they did supply measurements for the second delivery and it appeared that the delivery would fit .
neutral	they are sent , to be signed for , with a minimum cost of £ 0 . 00 .
negative	ripoff no . 0 :
positive	very easy purchasing .
negative	i was then told to go in to a store to get my new contract and phone .
positive	had a text to say it would be there between 00 ; 00to 00 ; 00 in all morning waiting .
negative	was promised 00mb down and 00mb up +- 0mb , on install got 00mb down and 0mb up .
negative	i have been with 000 - reg over 00 years_now buying domain_names
neutral	lucky for me in this case , i found the delivery guy at my door when i came home the following_day .
neutral	this also happened to our friends which_meant we both had to call the customer service , look for our documents to give the reference_number .
neutral	it took over a week to arrive . the item was reduced but thought the p / p was over the top for such a small light item i have now spoken to the company and all is resolved now happy with service
negative	i then got an_email_saying that i had to send my order through email and i had to explain to them what i wanted , as the design wouldn_'_t work for some bizarre reason .
neutral	- changing details an asking for re - quotes was a pain , shouldn_'_t this be automatic ?
negative	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
neutral	they both had a great time although my son did get very upset as there were 0 boys in particular in his dorm ( brothers ) who made everyone '_s life very difficult , whether it be hurting the boys , frightening them during the night , refusing to switch the lights off , pulling the bedcovers off them through the night and just being generally horrid .
positive	needed a small lightweight kettle and could not find one in the local_shops .
positive	really liked the products they were high_quality and as_described on the site .
neutral	my consignment came quite fast which was goog but disappointed with the discount cards they were absolutely_useless because there was no code on them ?
positive	they ticked all the boxes .
positive	very good quality .
neutral	i have just been depositing money so i dont see the point on going on iam just losing money so i am not playing anymore .
positive	highly_rated service , can '_t fault printing . com london_bridge .
neutral	still_waiting for sample product .
positive	needed high_quality batteries both before and after christmas for photographic use .
negative	!
negative	if they were honest about their lead times .
neutral	it would have been more useful for them to specify up front what deductions they make for blemishes and other small things on the phone , because you send it in with one price and then you get a different price in return which you can '_t do much about except accept .
negative	at one point they even told me they couldn_'_t find my order details .
neutral	having said that mark cartwright and his colleague were very professional and did their level best to help .
negative	phone now cut_off , will not respond to emails or faxs i say again !!!!!
neutral	was and was told out of stock and should hopefully have supplements by the end of the week , i can understand that products sell out , but it doesn_'_t take much to email / contact the buyer to let them know of the delay .
positive	with no_problems_whatsoever i purchase exactly_what is needed for my 0 dogs to endure the fireworks period with less stress than before i discovered the adaptil collars
positive	a +
neutral	my daughter has_been for the last 0 years and this was my sons second visit .
negative	), an item was returned and credited two_weeks before direct_debit was taken , i don_'_t think my bank should sort_out this issue .
negative	i sourced 0 pairs of shoes from another source , however decided to use the discount to gain the 0th .
negative	in addition , it was apparent when we got into our vehicle on collection , that someone had been driving the car in our absence .
neutral	would however be dubious_about buying from here for presents as other goods i bought weren_'_t wrapped in the cellophane wrapper .
neutral	used all the time handy tool
positive	in choosing a range , for our purposes , slight_problem with sizes and choice .
neutral	yeyyyyy very late but yey anyway .
negative	this saturday i met same delivery man , he said to me that he is gonna hit me once he finishes delivering , i simply called police and this delivery man disappeared quickly , i need to file proper complain in police_station as the company doesnt care , so be carefull
positive	i returned the item and within a few_days was sent a full_refund , great service .

positive	we have just moved and god_knows where my perscription would be !
positive	i initially tried to buy direct from the warehouse but this is not an option ; i did go back to an office , order online and pick_up the goods two hours_later !
neutral	regrettably , although acknowledging that there is a fault with the doors / panels , we have heard_nothing whatsoever from yale since .
neutral	i was under the impression that i would get 00 free sausages but only received 0 .
neutral	i ordered my wedding_invites off here , they where very good value and very simple to order and amend .
neutral	also selling fees are stupidly high !
neutral	i made an online purchase of a rug .
negative	so it hadn_'_t crossed my mind until now . how much longer will it take ?
negative	a 000_% mark up , extortionate .
positive	i am so happy to have found you and will be ordering again for sure .
neutral	perhaps they need not bother .
positive	i found the process very quick and easy .
negative	we don_'_t want halifax executives and managers to lose their jobs now do we ?
positive	simplicity_itself to select and order online , a quick and easy checkout with delivery options , reassuring updates and delivery right on time as arranged - perfect !
neutral	helps when loading pages buuuuuut the paper quality and printing was brilliant .
negative	i missed the flight from sydney to south_korea and had to travel in the next_day , which means :
positive	he showed me the deals on offer and explained them all in layman_terms .
neutral	the comedians at the comedy_club on friday and the service good , but the food ( burger and chips ) dreadful , think cardboard cold burgers and you would be there .
negative	dreadful service .
positive	the only down_side was i never received a confirmation_email ( even checked spam ) and have had to request the invoice .
neutral	the soups don_'_t taste that good .
negative	when they eventually arrived ( past the allotted dates given ) i opened up the package to find two of the four prints were both bent and ripped .
neutral	i notice however that i am left with a negative feeling towards tooled_- up .
neutral	flowers were fantastic but company was asked to leave them with a neighbour and instead they were left out over night outside the front of the garage door !
negative	then no one shows up .
neutral	we were a couple of friends on tour and rented 0 cars : car 0 reference_number_000000000 driver per tore boe / car 0 : 0000000000 driver roald rosendal .

negative	suffice to say it was not delivered .
negative	i ordered 0 of these cases along with 0 of each of whiskas anti - hairball , whiskas temptations & whiskas katzinis .
neutral	they need to use a different delivery company .
neutral	i have ordered much over the years and will again , but i am miffed that i ordered a guitar for next_day delivery , and then tracked the order to find it will arrive in two_weeks .
neutral	this was the only time i have ever felt quite angry with them but , as with most companies , if they are taking your money they are excellent , as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude !
positive	items are well_packaged and arrive on time .
positive	i could not fault their customer service and quality products .
negative	won_'_t use them again .
positive	would definately recommend physio_room to anyone
positive	i was notified that the product was out of stock .
negative	!
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	and never had anyproblems .
neutral	i used to use you very time when ordering items online .

negative	so embarrassed about them .
positive	slightly_disappointed that i couldn_'_t get them at the cheaper price offered by the outdoor shop , but very impressed with the customer service , and my new gaiters will arrive tomorrow .
negative	by the time she got home from work , it was 0pm and found her flowers in a green recycling_bin …. the recycling collection was due early the next_morning so she might never have received her flowers and they were no_longer a surprise plus she had to get dirty hunting round in the dark for her flowers .
negative	i immediately contacted yodel who told me that it would be passed on and i would get call as a matter of urgency .
negative	i told her it had squeezed in before but she said no , her computer did not accept vehicles beyond 0 metres in height .
neutral	you can_imagine i wasn_'_t too pleased !
positive	i love this shop !
negative	we had our 00th_anniversary party coming up on the 00th_june , this gave_us a clear week to get it stained , erected .

negative	is this legal as as far as i can see i have paid the money , but have no goods .
negative	he told me this was not possible !
negative	one for a three year contract and one for a pay as you go .
negative	this company is absolutely_useless at communication and customer service .
negative	a very thick cast_iron manhole !!
neutral	order now turned_up ( monday_morning )!
negative	!
negative	i bought a washing_machine and have had 0 engineers out to repair it , the first time they didnt have the right parts , the 0nd time came with no parts whatsoever and the 0rd time only fitted 0 of the parts .
negative	i undertand we have had easter and there would be a delay but nearly a month
neutral	this is down to basic admin !
negative	no response to any emails sent to customer_services .
negative	- further update -
neutral	that also implies that none of the only two staff we saw was qualified to drive other cars .
negative	they ripped us off , saying the phone we sent was water_damaged when the litimus strip was fine when sent .
neutral	don_'_t expect an easy ride .
negative	he refused to take any details , refused to chase it up for me , in fact he couldn_'_t wait to get me off the line quick enough .

neutral	anyway , i will pray for my own sake and lucks not to face with any_problems and every thing goes well smooth .
negative	i have used pet_supermarket for a number of years and have noticed they are not as good as they used to be .
neutral	car was rented at rentalcars . com , and actually rented from hertz .
neutral	return transfer in mallorca didn_'_t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi_fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .

positive	everything i '_ve ever bought from superdry has a stand_out effect , colours , size , material used are all perfect .
neutral	i followed this link at 00 . 00 to see my parcel was only round the corner but would be another 0hr_00mins as it was on drop 00 and mine was 00 .

positive	highly_recommend .
neutral	when i opened the parcel the colour of the sweater seemed significantly different to how it looked in the photo on the website i had anticipated a truer ' christmas red ' and it was a rather rusty - red . i didnt like the colour , so decided to return it .
neutral	i needed to make bookings urgenty , and so it was helpful that the staff knew what they were doing , but i felt a bit pressured to make the decision within a specific time frame with no opportunity to change my mind
neutral	the invoice within the box was correct , but the products were not .
positive	if you want a reliable ebay_seller , use them .
negative	yodel said they could do nothing as the parcel was a " successful delivery ", so anywhere_near is a success , no wonder they claim 00 - 00_% delivery rate , they just make up a different definition to the rest of the world what is a successful delivery .
neutral	most of the products as a good description , some only in english ; it ´_s not a major_issue for me but i '_ve had some problems understanding some words since i '_m portuguese .

negative	why - was i allowed to place an order for 0 - 0 day delivery on out of stock items ?
positive	i used shiply to obtain quotes for moving chairs from ebay_seller to my friend .
neutral	whilst the customer service of the company seems pretty good the course i followed ( social_media marketing for dummies ) was clearly created a long time ago .
neutral	now dealt_with and a second print is apparently on its way .
neutral	they tend to deliver on time .
positive	!
neutral	the item itself does what it says on the tin .

positive	i had a trial to test out some frames and i could have done it again if i had wanted .
neutral	bought an arte shower_rail kit , the chrome rail itself doesn_'_t match the chrome of the other parts and appears yellowish in colour .
negative	totally pissed_off with this company , as have been waiting over 0_weeks for my order and their only response is to carry on waiting .
neutral	no actual date when it was expected or even a overnight postage to placate me .
neutral	so if your a lady with normal lady curvy legs be careful what size you order .
neutral	easy to use , flowers did not look as good as picture ,, delivery expensive
positive	goods accurately_described and promptly delivered .
neutral	i paid an extra £_00 on top of the delivery but the couriers decided to split the delivery onto 0 vans so that they both got paid , i had to wait in for 0 box after the first three were delivered , i don_'_t believe the extra money i spent on delivery was worth having to wait in for 0 seperate ones .
negative	so i reiterate - never book a premier_inn room .
negative	when agreement between payment sense and us was made - they say : no rolling_contract and hidden_fees , standard payment all the time which was agreed over the phone , free cancellation any day or time .
neutral	my complaint on both these occasions relates to the lack of communication , indeed on the recent occasion their website record showed my prescription as having been checked two_weeks before they phoned me .

positive	no_hassle ordering and next_day delivery what more could you ask
neutral	this caused my order to take 0_weeks to reach me .
negative	they say on their site that they have a 000_% guarantee but i '_m currently at 0 %!
negative	bought 0 items from amazon over 0_days , the delivery companies they use govern when or if we receive the item , home delivery network are a useless buch of scruffy oiks that lie on the delivery sheet , turn_up if an when they feel like it , and faced with a 000mtr dive up the lane to my house would rather mark the item undeliverable and send it back .
negative	!,
neutral	a package arrived for jason ford who assumed it was his and started_using the product .

positive	made ordering what we wanted so easy and the next_day delivery option really suited our needs .
neutral	!
positive	and extremely fast service .
negative	i received a half - hearted apology and that was all .

positive	good value .
neutral	contacted customer service , who may i add were very helpful , to be told they would send out the missing pair .
positive	processed very quickly their end and money transferred straight_away , or cheque posted .

neutral	i went for the buy one get one free offer , however , it should have been 00 . 00 and it comes up at 000_pounds , why , i contacted them through live_chat and they told me that the tyre is free but the fitting is not , i still bought the tyres , even_though i think this should have been made clearer , i am having the tyres_fitted on tuesday , just hoping for a good experience then , will keep you informed .
negative	when it still hadn_'_t arrived i continued to call daily only to be told the same thing .
negative	after_speaking to inghams twice , once on the phone and once via social_media , i '_ve basically been told tough .
negative	so i have now had to order product from elsewhere and am now awaiting a refund from thephysioroom ( which i havent had yet !!!)

positive	?
positive	very good price and good serice
neutral	card used - medium to good quality - not very thick .
positive	can '_t ask for better service than that .
neutral	they had my money and so be it .
neutral	not even when i emailed them direct .

neutral	international services definitely requires improvement .
negative	when comparing_prices online , you often go for the very cheapest - even if by just a few_pounds .
neutral	. when i recently booked for a car_hire pick_up at glasgow_airport i did not expect ( as it was not stated online at time of booking and having not read the information on my reservation confirmation ) to have to find a bus stance and get taken off the airport to collect the car , which of course , meant that the same had to happen for the return of the vehicle , whereas i expected to leave car in the airport car_park not to calculate the additional time required for this extra journey .
negative	finally at night time a woman turned_up with the parcel & said this [_external_reference_] driver said he couldn_'_t deliver it .

negative	actually had to phone them 0 + times before they send me a technician to come check my home line . also they promised me some broadband_speed but they supplied me with 0 . 0mbps which was slower_than my mobile_phone internet from 0 . when im complaint and threatened to cancel my contract and go to another_provider they give me a best offer ever to keeping_me in with refreshing my contract but also try to charge my sky high fee for cancellation when i am gone . so had been forced to stay with them for next year .

positive	site was straight_forward to use .
negative	without paying a high price to call sky , which many people are unprepared to do , it is very hard to get in touch with sky unless you ' re happy to deal with a non uk_based centre ( which i '_m not ).
negative	after i had complained and informed them , they still took it out several days .
negative	they did return it , but why were they retaining my card_details ????
positive	textlocal were very helpful in my first campaign and i will be using them again in the near_future .
negative	if you look them up on companies house , you '_ll see that they change registered address several_times from warwickshire to essex to london , the directors and secretaries are appointed then resign the next_day .
negative	i took out a one month_contract for mobile_broadband and made it clear that it was just a stop gap whilst waiting for sky to be installed - so definitely only wanted it for one month .
positive	køber helt_klart her igen , hvis vi skulle mangle noget .
neutral	i got a credit_note for the whole amount but have subsequently been invoiced for the goods on one invoice and the delivery on another . i . e .
neutral	the hasstle of returning the package to a collection shop and filling in the forms meant that i have ended_up keeping it !

neutral	this required them to re - order and for me to come_back the next_day for fitting .
neutral	0 days_later i got an email_saying they wanted proof of my address before they ' d release the order for delivery - again for my " security ".
neutral	i guess they '_ll reject this too .
neutral	the ideal scenario would have been that the flowers turned_up at my wife '_s work early in the day and they would have been on display on her desk for the day for all to see .

negative	my husband commented that the starter was not thst good and the waiter ( who we later found out was the duty_manager ) came back and said he wasn_'_t walking away .
positive	it was really useful to receive text_messages and emails to let_me know when the flowers were on their way and when they had been delivered - even stated that they were left_securely on the doorstep , as i instructed if no one was home .
positive	brilliant prices , fabulous customer service !
neutral	either they had been damaged in transit , or were old stock .
positive	i also ordered another and sent it to my brother - he has a watch collection ( mainly expensive ) and i thought a wewood_watch a delightful and interesting addition .
negative	my only issue with freestyle_extreme is that considering i have used you before i was disappointed to have been charged for postage on a particular item using credit_card
neutral	i bought a prs 000 - nice guitar , good muso salesman , satisfactory transaction .
neutral	i intend to use the amp for gigging so no doubt it will receive a few more dings along the way .
neutral	be interested to know how others compare as cover similar routes and others seem less busy .
neutral	i emailed again to advise i had received the item but was disappointed with the lack of communication from the company and to give them an opportunity to respond to my concerns before i put a rating on the website . no overly_impressed , and no offer of a reimbursement of the additional_charge i paid for the quick delivery .
negative	following my complaint , the flowers were delivered at midnight on 00 / 00 / 00 , waking_up the household .
positive	that '_s how i view ' pharmacy0u '

neutral	this is the 0nd time i have bought a bike from them in as many months .
negative	ive called again today after a week of silence after [_name_] said she '_d speak to the supplier again .
negative	i was informed that this was ok , but when they eventually decided to send the tops they ' forgot ' to change the address so i had to inform the shipping company myself , which was a massive hassle for everyone_involved .
neutral	ok but slow especially with the referral fee , not too good with communication either of keeping you up to date with your claim , i was having to ring to find out where i stood
neutral	i booked a day trip to edinburgh , which i did enjoy , but it would have been better had there been a courtesy pickup at my hotel .
neutral	rimmed frames were perfect and i am very pleased with them .
neutral	i haven_'_t heard whether i will be refunded for the £_00 saturday delivery charge , yet .
positive	in both_cases i have chosen pet_supermarket .

positive	all we want to do is get our car without_any complications .
neutral	i have learnt a lesson to just buy this sort of product from a department_store like b_& q where i could have easily taken it back and swapped it at no expense .
positive	what a great find on the internet , brilliant range of work_tops to choose from .
neutral	dispatch in a very good timely maner and a very good communication on the customer service level .

positive	completely_satisfied with the product and the service .
negative	when i called back to report this , i was told that i still have to pay the £_000 but that i can spread this in my direct_debit over the next 00 months .
positive	the woman i spoke to was very helpful and said you would ring back in 00_minutes which she did .
positive	placed order and arrived next_day fully_tracked to my door so i knew_exactly_what time to expect it .
negative	mistakes can happen but it '_s expedia '_s utter lack of any sort of ' customer service ' and failure to resolve problems which makes them so dreadful .

negative	called them four times to give them readings again . two letter form collection agencies and one final demand ( threatening to appear at my doorstep ) later i am still_waiting for my final_bill .
neutral	i simply cannot recommend this company to anyone because they had so many opportunities to make things right but failed .
positive	why_bother going to garage and waiting as its always longer_than they tell you .
negative	to be honest , they had some difficulty completely understanding english .
negative	will never deal with this company again and will encourage all those i know to do the same .
positive	still got loads left to eat , all frozen now and have had another fillet from frozen and was a s good as the first .
positive	it is helpful being_able to order online as i have severe_arthritis and often cannot leave the house to access shops so this service is a great boon .
negative	!
positive	my item was dispatched very quickly and i was kept_updated about its location every_step of the way .
negative	they clearly don_'_t understand their customers
negative	we received plenty of correspondence when they thought we hadn_'_t paid our bill , when we rang them up about the latter , after confirming with the bank that it had been paid , they told us the money had been paid and they informed us that they never said we hadn_'_t paid it , even_though we had been receiving letters from solicitors acting on their behalf claiming we hadn_'_t paid it .
negative	take instructions up front for delivery dates and what to do if no answer for leaving the parcel .
positive	my outfit was dispatched the same day and delivery was very fast , being_able to track my order was also very helpful and the text_message to say my item will be delivered today and then that it had been delivered was fantastic .
negative	easy jet should be renamed hardist jet .
negative	fill it up few form and then i get by post another one .
negative	did you read my review ?
neutral	bbw products are great - when you can get them .
neutral	east_midlands airport_parking is not disabled friendly .
neutral	the price was good this time had 0 discounts but it took a week to come .
negative	the ticketing_system is also useless .
neutral	the description says the table ' opens and folds in seconds ' - not if you include the time to screw in / out all 0 legs .

positive	ordered tools late on sunday_evening at a great price
positive	thanks
positive	recently i decided to buy myself a baritone ukulele , not an expensive one , just a reasonable priced starter .
negative	this has_been going on for 0 months now and despite make wasting many hours emailing them and calling them they are now threatening me with legal_action as they have allowed the amount to increase to over £_000 !
neutral	then it falls down with delivery .
positive	what this is basically is you go to a different website where its listed for cheaper , supplement_warehouse doesn_'_t just match the price , it gives you it for much less .
neutral	the paper seemed too thin .
positive	item arrived securely_packed and quickly .
neutral	much to slow in telling_me about this hence a very disappointing and unnecessary delay .
positive	i '_m 0 ' 0 " tall , with a 00 " inside_leg and the tights are not too_tight and the legs have the right length to suit me .
positive	price is good and competitive , and really appreciate free shipping so they are the only online vet retailer i will go back to .
positive	but they always arrive very quickly and taste good too .

neutral	i await the response from their " investigations team ".
neutral	fortunately what was delivered was very good and mum thought they were beautiful .
negative	they are without_any doubt the most disorganised and inept company i have ever_dealt_with and i would strongly_advise anyone looking to switch to them not to , i cannot think of any positive thing to say about them other than the one member of staff who did try and help me : chris mcateer - though his_efforts seem to have been screwed_up by them anyway .
negative	i suspect they ' re simply ' boxshifters ' - if it '_s in stock , fine but if not .
positive	i love these albums , this is the 0th one i '_ve bought .
negative	this was a christmas center piece which was useless after the holidays .
positive	i found the range available to be extremely vast and despite the fact i paid to have the items delivered in the next 0 - 0 working_days , it arrived first thing the following_morning , on a saturday .

positive	worktop_express gave_us the best quote by a long way and the quality was still superb .
positive	solwise product was fine , did what it said on the tin , as they say .
negative	opened the box to double_check and now i am stuck with them as they won_'_t take returns once opens but the lenses are intact .
neutral	this was my fault , of course .
positive	they have a good range to choose from , catering for all requirments .
neutral	luckily we found the same tv_unit on another website under a different name , which we now have and it too looks great .
negative	i gave home address for delivery i called in the morning to check on delivery as not confident i would receive it , they had home address with postcode and work postcode , they were trying to deliver to work again .
negative	a webchat then revealed that they had dispatched the glasses ( no notification to me ) and they tried to say that it was my fault for not being in to receive a delivery - no card from the couriers , no delivery attempted !
positive	i was impressed with polybags service especially when they send you samples to try out .
negative	the tracking page was incomprehensible and all i could i make out was that a notice of attempted delivery had been put through my door and the parcel no_longer needed to be signed for .
positive	items were exactley as_described and as they looked in the picture and a good price too .
negative	meanwhile the event its needed for is in 0 days and proaudio won_'_t send another unless i reorder and pay again .
neutral	any modern day php developer knows that many of your applications files do not belong in the publicly accessible part of your website .
positive	really quick and reliable service would recommend to anyone
positive	youmtell them what phone you have , you fill in your details , they send you an envelope , you send the phone off , sit_back , and a cheque pops intob your letterbox a week_later . what could be simpler . its brilliant .
neutral	fair_enough if i '_d been using it for months , but i '_d only had it 0_days and so it should be a given that it was faulty from the start .
positive	i liked the fact that i didn_'_t have to complete the book all in one go and could revisit my file whenever i chose .
positive	we realised we had forgotten to order more frontline and ticks had been found on our dog meg .
negative	delivery method will be the fastest available and generally within 0_days , depending_on customer location .'
negative	i '_m as surprised as the next person to find that trustpilot is actually impossible to leave a false negative_review in as the business owner has total veto unless evidence can be provided , hence_why the false positive from the original reviewer was retained !
negative	good network , i wasn_'_t so impressed when my bill one month came to £_000 !
positive	the online site is easy to use and secure .
neutral	i have had to contact customer service to check / amend stuff and when i have been in contact with their out of uk call_centre service has_been apalling !
positive	very good service which gave_me updates of when the flowers had left the depot and when they had been delivered .
negative	when they received my ipad they sent me an offer of £_000 !
positive	thoroughly_recommend .
neutral	some areas of the surface was even flaking off .
negative	£_000 . 00 is an awful_lot of money for me to lose .
neutral	that '_s my only major_issue .
positive	when it arrived , all the bits were there .
positive	i found there my favourite product - it '_s not on sale in any of the shops in my town .
neutral	great products but website crashed on me and products delivered to wrong place before being retrieved and sent back to me .

negative	some 00_minutes later the enterprise representative asked me for more money than i had agreed to on the telephone so i refused .
positive	the order was easy to place and followed up really quickly with a confirmation_email .
negative	i phoned on friday 00th to find out what was happening and a lady stated that she would refund the money i paid for the flowers as she could not get through to anyone in the international department .
positive	very good website offering a wide_range of competitively_priced tyres .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
negative	i have a longstanding issue with a broken foot , which was one of the reasons we booked a centrally_located glasgow hotel , and you see fit to offer alternatives not within the same city ?
neutral	complained to driver who claimed the damage was done before they took possession of the flowers .
neutral	items were as requested so can only suggest the delivery company used is reviewed and maybe changed .
positive	ordered a glass sink with tap and waste from the huge_selection available .
negative	basically , you get a sheet of settings and then you ' re on your own .
negative	she tried to fob me off saying the flowers may have been left with a neighbour .
neutral	the person on the telephone should have advised i needed them
negative	any way the engineer came in the 00st , pressed the reset button and it started up .
negative	when i sent an e_- mail it was not explained very well , i also rang and got the same response .
neutral	drop_off in front of the terminal_building - step off the bus and into the terminal , and repeat backwards on return .
negative	worst and most rude company i have ever dealt_with .
neutral	was quick and friendly and new pieces were out quickly .
negative	?
negative	the almonds i purchased tasted really bitter .
negative	i ordered a cctv monitor .
neutral	hope wood has_been seasoned properly .
neutral	however , since january_0000 , this prior excellent delivery has_been very poor , which is very disappointing as i love their products but can '_t rely_on delivery and as i use specialis litter , and cannot_afford to not receive it in time replace old litter .
positive	items always delivered promptly and without problems
neutral	so very poor on resolving issues as you are directed to their help section on the web_site but if you cant find the answer there you will have a very hard time getting to speak with anyone , this is very frustrating .
negative	sound like a company you want to waste money on ?
positive	can '_t fault anything , well_done .
neutral	also sagepay or whatever is a bit lame .
positive	we had an ' out of the box ' query that was dealt_with by a friendly and efficient person on the phone .
positive	no_issues , would definitely use again .
negative	she was put on hold .
neutral	the shop was ok , quite well stocked .
positive	!
neutral	although my bathroom is not yet fully installed it looks good and i think i am going to be pleased with it .
neutral	however , when we arrived in playa las americas the hotel had no idea who we were and was unaware of any booking .
neutral	ideal for the store cupboard as an emergancy .
positive	great service for delivery of a large bunk_bed .
neutral	i have a pair of size 0 aigle_wellies and the clogs were tighter than them !
neutral	ordered for special_occasion so needed same day what i ordered only to to recieve confirmation_email_stating it would be delivered the next_day , customer service no assistance said they would try to arrange it flowers did turn_up following_day not impressed will not be using again

negative	i say called , i never actually spoke to a human !
positive	otticanet was a delight to do_business with .
positive	need i say more , good shopping and always a delight to spend money on bargains .
positive	the uploading of the prescriptions and the ability to be able to see past purchases and the brilliant email reminders you get when the time comes to have a repeat_prescription is very handy indeed .
neutral	i found the location convenient and quick and would have been very happy with the service , except the paint work on the car had been damaged over the wheel hub and pocked in other_places .
positive	the gentleman i spoke to was very friendly and helpful and answered all my queries fully .
negative	please , please , please think_twice about purchasing anything through groupon , its closest you will get to a rogue trader online .
positive	what more can you ask from a company .
neutral	i thought your products and prices are great but you could not forfill my order and my part order took to long to deliver but i will give you the benefit of the doubt and try you again
neutral	no wonder they charge delivery at £ 0 . 00 for a purchase of £ 0 . 00 !
neutral	the order confirmation made no reference to the delay , and viewing the order on the website did not help .
positive	the prices were virtually half of what we had been quoted by the tavel agents .
neutral	i would have liked to have given 0 starts .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time and were as_described but only just . the picture_showed a much healthier bloom than we received .
negative	that was the last i heard about that .
neutral	on the ticket are your details , no explanation of this is given when you book , annd it would help if they just said , take the ticket and as you '_ve already pre_paid just put it in the machine when you leave .
positive	excellent pricing and very speedy delivery , with great communication .
negative	they clearly have a problem and a mail forwarding service which is that unreliable is simply a service not being delivered .
neutral	use a better delivery company , i don_'_t understand , what with all the choices out there .
negative	on 00th_april received an e_- mail refunding me with an amount relating to part of the order which was not available but no e_- mail from the seller explaining or apologising for this - my pet hate when online sites take your order and your money and then decide it is not available .
negative	without us , you will lose out in the long run !
neutral	i understand , that the company do not notify buyers re dispatch .
neutral	i paid_extra for a service which was supposed to collect the same day and deliver the next_day .
neutral	i met the delivery driver and everything in the back of the van had just been thrown in and there was a big hole in my parcel , luckily it wad not damaged !
negative	noted other customers had frustrations with broken delivery promises .
neutral	as you can see from my review the key objective was acheived - i got the parcel .
neutral	the bracelet fitting service was very useful .
negative	advised i wanted it delivered in the afternoon .
neutral	you have to ' select ' the free delivery option the site doesn_'_t do this automatically !
negative	emailed uk mail who helpfully replied it was left at number 0 .
negative	the next_day i sent yet again another email to be told that they had been out of the office the previous day and hadn_'_t come in until late the day after that .
neutral	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
positive	my partners outfit didn_'_t look as good as it had online but we still both came runners up at the fancy_dress_party , would recommend and use again .
neutral	delivery was prompt but parcel was damaged at the bottom and the delivery driver put it on the floor without telling us it was open so it looked fine until we picked it up and found the bottom open .
positive	i will definitely return .
negative	i did not shout at her and she just continued to tell me she was terminating the call .
neutral	i had a kind of mixed experience with homebase , though i would shop with them again .

negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 another failure , unbelievable waste of time .
positive	totally happy .
neutral	!
negative	do not buy from figleaves . i ordered 0 bikini tops to be sure i got the right size .
neutral	00_minutes check in time is the downside .
neutral	however , it did not point out the differences_between two remotes with the same number , and i inevitably ordered the wrong one .
neutral	the courier came the day after , to then find he did not have it in the van , which i really needed the part .
negative	bordering on fraud , yet it took repeated demands to get that refunded .
positive	really good service , have used them several_times to order their mixed boxes for beers for parties .
negative	i am still_waiting for the second order !
positive	manchester_airport is a winner all_round .
negative	i was told the 0 drawer set was in stock and although their website said they would " price match ", the small units were £_00 each cheaper_elsewhere but they wouldn_'_t " price match ".
negative	0_weeks_later . still no refund , had excuses as to why so i have now contacted my card_issuer to claim the money back through them
neutral	then i got an apologetic e_- mail saying the loungers wouldn_'_t be with me until early may as they were on their way from china .
neutral	!
negative	i would not use this company again !
negative	infact everything was great until the courier basically threw the flowers at the recipient .
neutral	hat the hidden_costs , but still the cheapest !
neutral	i '_m_sure this is fine with a heavier or lined fabric , but it would have been much_better to fix the label to the back of the top of this blind where it wouldn_'_t be seen .
neutral	i had them delivered on thursday which was her_birthday , when i went to her house on the sunday i was sad to see that the bouquet was very wilted and almost dead .
neutral	very well_packaged and ready for me to use straight_away .
positive	tje fire_escape ladder was very reasonably_priced and arrived within a few_days .
positive	00 out of 00 . thank_you .
negative	when i explained there was a 00 hour time difference and i doubted very much the florist would reply in the middle of the night she didn_'_t seem at all concerned .
negative	i '_d heard of the site so assumed i '_d be fine using it , wasn_'_t until after i placed my order that i even thought to read a review , found loads of bad ones and a few good ones , but seeing as how i already ordered thought i could be one of the lucky ones and get my stuff .
neutral	free upgrade
neutral	will give them another opportunity in the future .
neutral	thank_you .
positive	rhianna stating 0 - 00 days .
negative	these arrived and my partner found one side of the arrangement was all snapped and damaged .
negative	i have just sent another email chasing it up but am not very hopeful anymore .
positive	i would and have recommended pedal on to anyone .
positive	the glucosamine tablets were a lot cheaper_than i could_find elsewhere on the web .
negative	pay the extra to go with a more well_known company that you can_trust !
positive	it '_s very reassuring to be able to speak to a real_person !

negative	i therefore lost all of my money .
negative	0 days late on collection .
positive	delivery was quick so , so top_marks all_round .
neutral	!
neutral	a double whammy hit on the benefits from using a tesco credit_card .
neutral	some of my sales are printers , around 0kg in medium to large boxes , 00 x 00 x 00 cm .
positive	many_thanks .
positive	item posted quickly without high shipping prices .
negative	i was on hold for 00_minutes before giving up .
positive	just follow there easy instructions and you wont have any_problems .
neutral	i understand that there can be delays , however on this occasion when i had not been provided with the original flower order and that they were not delivered when i was assured they would be , i cannot help but be disappointed with the overall service received .
neutral	i used to shop from here regularly but the website re - design over the past year or so makes the experience frustrating .
neutral	good selection of drinks and rarities , price about right .
neutral	it then put me in an awkward_position having to go to a random person '_s house ( repeatedly as they weren_'_t in ).
positive	the quality of their blinds is top_class , their service , speed and reliability is second to none .
negative	customer_services are supposed to at_least try to make things better darren made it much worse .
positive	great products and offers .
negative	my advice - the price they put online is too good to be true .
neutral	i would have liked for you to have discovered this fact before completing the cushion .
negative	she kept saying again i had assumed that it would come with the cartidge .
negative	couldn_'_t take the risk .
neutral	on top of the late delivery , the mouse i ordered was not included nor was any explanation as to why it wasn_'_t included , i was forced to call their support_team myself and enquire , only to be told that they were awaiting stock and then that the mouse i had ordered had been_discontinued .
neutral	they also delivered it to her home address as it was too late for delivery to the work address given .
neutral	best not to have them sent directly to someone , but have them sent to you first and prepare them before giving them as a gift .
negative	worst service ever .
negative	opened the box and all the peaches roses had started turning_brown and we ' re clearly not fresh .
positive	i am very happy with my purchase , and the excellent extended guarantees offered by gur .
neutral	all in all , no issues with my items but wasn_'_t expecting it to take as long as it did to receive the cheque .

negative	my partner had a mobile internet contract with them but since_moving in with me had no need for it .
negative	well !
neutral	the offer is totally misleading .
positive	was extremely quick done in two_days .
neutral	when i emailed them to ask why it had still not been sent i received no reply but my delivery did arrive the following_day .
positive	placed an order online .
negative	my first time using parts_gateway has not been good . the main_reason was the part i was supplied with was fauly / heavy corrosion and with the incorrect abs lead fitted ( obvious not for my car , i confirmed this with renault who did not recognise part number of abs lead fitted ). i called the supplier rp services who were not very helpfull and said if i return item ( extra_cost of postage ) they would inspect and if found faulty they might return money . as part was needed i sought alternative supply and decide to cut my loss .
positive	this company offers an excellent range of products at a good price and delivered on time .
negative	their paperwork is poor with no contact numbers on the email with the order number on .
negative	i was depending_on these flowers and cards to arrive in time for my grandmother to see them before going into hospital for a risky operation .
neutral	i don_'_t do file sharing so it can '_t be due to the traffic management policy for 00m customers .
neutral	even_though you offer the best prices compared to other_websites , you do not seem to acknowledge your frequent customers .
neutral	order it the afternoon before the party .
negative	pretending to care by posting a reply after the horse had bolted is clearly pointless and highlighted by many other reviews .
positive	thanks mazuma .
negative	i tried and tried .
neutral	total repair bill £_000 +.
neutral	the problem i had was that after exhausting available cars for that holiday_period , i found & booked an affordable car with vip_cars .

negative	i waited in all day and they never turned_up !
neutral	0 .
neutral	i have two holidays with this company and the first one was a breeze .
positive	i phoned to ask for advice and was dealt_with by a great guy_who was extremely_helpful and good fun !
positive	very down to earth , knowledgeable and not pushy like some salesmen can be .

negative	the lenses were with the frames when i left the shop .
neutral	i will use them again .
neutral	like i say i ordered no second - hand stuff , got no response to a query and the transaction system leaves a bit to be desired , so a cautious 0_stars in_spite of excellent product and quick , well - packed delivery .

neutral	i placed my order .
negative	i was so upset to read the flowers had been messed_up .
neutral	i have only rated the company 0_stars though and that is probably generous because they sent me rubbish instructions with what i ordered and when i emailed and emailed them to find out how i use what i purchased , i just didnt get anywhere with them .
positive	i was also given an excellent deal .
neutral	cant understand the labels on most of the products but they are cheap and fair quality
neutral	i would defo recommend this website but i would prefer to have an_email to confirm order & any updates
positive	our older daughter ( 00 ) wishes she were lighter so that she would be allowed to play on it too !
negative	i double_checked the description and called ebuyer as the description clearly said ' this brother_dr - 0000 black_cartridge .' having a legal background i know the importance of proof and therefore took a screenshot of the desciption page .
positive	i dealt_with various staff who were all excellent , my most sincere_thanks must go to paul slater whom was extremely polite and professional , he made it all easy for us and has an unlimited amount of patience .

negative	steer_well clear , it has a 0 . 0 score for a reason .
positive	i just love it and would recommend it if you want to feel sensual and feminine .
neutral	i emailed back , somewhat miffed , saying that i couldn_'_t_believe a company that makes its living from deliveries for special_occasions could be so remiss as to leave something like whether the intended_recipient does indeed receive the order to complete chance .
negative	from the very start this was a bad_experience .
neutral	however it is easily fixed by setting the apache documentroot to a subfolder such as public_html / public .
negative	messed_up my meter so that i was no_longer paying on the correct meter number .
positive	very quick and very professional will always use shiply to get large items delivered
negative	two_weeks has already_passed now and i still have no idea where my box is .
negative	the comapny is a sham and it is about time either trading_standards or the isp '_s collectively do something to stop consumers being_ripped_off yet again
positive	was out of stock from main store but recieved a phone_call the day after ordering to confirm that i was happy to wait .
negative	my wife discovered an item on her till receipt that she did not buy .
positive	i ordered an artic super_dry windcheater in size large it didn_'_t fit , i sent it back ordering an extra large size which came within days of sending the original one back , this one too was too small , sent it back by free collect service , and ordered an extra extra large which again was sent within day '_s of sending the other one back , very very good service , but must_say the item is a very slim_fit so order two sizes larger than you normally would .
neutral	i sent a iphone 0 00gb off and was offered £_000 .
neutral	i think the principle of the support is good just need to get the sizing right .
negative	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
positive	i ordered 0 miniatures & they arrived very well_packed & quickly .

positive	someone told me to get a prescription from the vet and go to viovet . co . uk to dispense the meds .
negative	0_weeks_later and nothing has happened .
negative	he repeatedly changed his story saying he had , then he didnt know , and he didnt even get a signature so we have no idea who ended_up with the gift .
neutral	it didn_'_t take long to assemble the 00ft trampolin the main problem was keeping the legs up .
negative	after another week and still no headphones i sent another email to which they didn_'_t reply to for a few_days .
negative	today i received yet another cold call from them .
positive	i can '_t fault cult_pens .
positive	there is no reason not to deal with this company !
negative	thank_you
negative	if the order could be delayed by 00_hours why was it not despatched earlier to allow for this known and expected delay .
neutral	i expect if you pay extra for something you as a company should deliver .
negative	so massively out of pocket for a day not worked and £ 0 worth of 0000 call charges later , i have no idea what is happening or where my parcel is .
neutral	could not use my mobile_phone in holland , caused quite a few problems
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be having any more .
neutral	the capsules don_'_t fit_properly in my nespresso and often just either fall through into the collection tray , or require extra positioning that regular nespresso_capsules do not .

neutral	large blind sticks and goes squint often .
negative	i mean are these people for real ?
negative	!
neutral	today the money is back in my account , i am happy with the result even if it took a while , and best of all i have a really smart and useful knife_block .
negative	never again .
negative	needless to say the company did not contact me after this review .
positive	both_times they have been reasonably_priced , the correct item , and i will always go back to them for this product .
positive	its great !
neutral	customer service a little frustrating , as advised that one of the in - stock items is in fact out of stock .

negative	i don_'_t mind having both orders if you could kindly send
negative	goodbye ipostparcels r . i . p
positive	i ordered online very easily and the keys arrived on the doormat the day after .
neutral	everything in the experience was very good .
negative	i got all the details from the person i talked to the second time and they were very apologetic but it wasn_'_t helping_me much as they said it was too late to turn him around now .
negative	what ?
negative	just about made it .
positive	i have used this company many_times and have been extremely pleased of there product range , value for money , delivery prices and speed .
positive	i ' d recommend them .

negative	my next call was 0_days after ordering and was again told it would be sent out that day .
neutral	i was very impressed with this service and appreciative of his help and manner since a problem had arisen and was then solved promptly .
negative	he explained that the flight prices move up and down , ok , i understand that .
positive	have used several_times in the past .
neutral	i think it was a week from order to delivery
neutral	the fault with my old one was that the plastic insert had perished & i assume that you have to purchase the whole_thing rather_than a bit of plastic insert .
negative	the lady i spoke to ( who was very polite ) just said they couldn_'_t do it .
negative	i purchased these for a birthday_present .
positive	it worked_perfectly fine .
positive	the comments on site encouraged me to order and i am not disappointed .

neutral	i like the range of products , and free delivery and returns .
positive	a great produce with new ideas in the pipe line .
negative	let '_s be clear on one thing - i have no_issues in paying for what i owe , none whatsoever .

neutral	yes i know i could pay for faster delivery . but why should i ?
neutral	if you have any further questions by e_- mail or phone our support_team will be happy to help .
neutral	i received my breaker 00 days after i ordered it .
positive	the canvas is very high_quality , the service outstanding , and the price very reasonable .
neutral	there was no explanation as to why the addresses we had were not acceptable necessitating a phone_call and the paperwork side was difficult to follow as well .
positive	i will_definately be recomending you to my friends :)
negative	it would seem that if you scour the very small_print , cashback won_'_t be paid by premier_inn if the customer is a " no - show ".
neutral	this was a little_bit frustrating , especially as it was important for my family and i to think about the text and wait_until the next_day or so to actually place the order .
neutral	last may i had my glasses repaired and you sent them to my old work address so i updated my details with a phone_call .
neutral	power cuts in villa .
positive	why would anyone pay full price from petshops when you can buy direct . delivered to your door and at a fraction of the cost
positive	the only_reservation i have is whether i can not eat them before the party .=)
positive	having ordered items monday am and chosen normal postage , i was amazed and impressed when it was delivered tuesday with the first post .
negative	avoid and buy new - lap tops are getting cheaper and cheaper .
positive	this product differs from prescription ed medication in that it not only dramatically increases the physical ability to perform satisfactorily but also has a great effect on the libido .
neutral	i chose to order from lock and key mainly_because of the low_prices that they offered .
positive	got exactly_what i wanted !
positive	although the dish_washer i purchased wasn_'_t in stock , one was immediately ordered from the manufacturers and delivered to marks the next_day .
negative	incidentally , they don_'_t have a telephone service , do not let the published number deceive you in to thinking they will answer the phone , it '_s a droll little automated selection followed_by the phone ringing out , there '_s no one there .
neutral	that couldn_'_t have been possible as i had selected paypal .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that the picture on the front of the jigsaw was not the same as the as the actual jigsaw .
positive	this company was reccomended to me , and i can why .
positive	delivery was on the day we chose , at a good time and quickly unloaded .
positive	i received the postage pack within a couple of days , i sent the phone the following_day using the recommended delivery option , then received an email the day after saying the package had been received and was being_processed , cheque arrived a couple of days after that .
negative	go to any vip collectors record fair and you will find virtually all cd singles for sale in those same pvc sleeves : it is standard_practice .
neutral	i enclosed the returns paperwork requesting a larger_size and had the confirmation_email that they had depatched the item but on the email they had depatched the item to the incorrect_address ( as they had my old address set_up as the default address ), so i rang them straight_away to let them know that they had made this error .
positive	thanks alot_easier to read .
negative	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left_behind . etc .
neutral	products look good now they are in place .
neutral	they werent in stock but were supposed to be shipped to golfstoreeurope within 0 - 0 days .
negative	very dodgy
negative	a very blunt message .
neutral	companies should bot advertise items until they are assured that they can actually deliver rather_than just comment " out of stock ", and then make their customer wait .
negative	ordered camera kit on saturday 00th .
neutral	00_mins later no sign , phoned again was told they had no record of me making the reservation , i can forward the email , eventually at 0am my car was collected .
positive	bought some grips .
neutral	i booked through them because they were the cheapest .

neutral	now ive been waiting for a cheaque that was posted 0 days ago & i still_havent recieved it .
neutral	so i went to another breakers and purchased the same part at the same price .
neutral	i ended_up discarding it and wrapping the brushes alone .

negative	the store manager is ineffective .
negative	!
neutral	satisfactory_outcome .
neutral	the phone_calls i received regarding my item varied from after 0 mins asking for my sort code and claiming i had agreed to taking out their insurance . i hadn_'_t !
positive	excellent service .
positive	because of onsite complications had to return product , money was refunded immediately , very good service would use this company again .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	this was in central_london where delivery is notoriously_difficult .
positive	i am so happy with the results and after 00 + years of wearing_glasses it was fantastic to find freedom at last .
positive	their service levels and website were as good , if not better , than the previous time .
neutral	i would not use this service again .
positive	all_round , an excellent service which i would recommend to anyone .
positive	thank_you .
neutral	i use the web a lot for shopping and research and i see excellent sites and those that border on the tedious .
neutral	they are now sending a third so i hope that it is third time lucky .
neutral	the tracking i could do nothing about , as you don_'_t know it '_s off until you '_ve driven it a while .
neutral	it '_s only a propelling pencil .
neutral	and nearly delivered on time . all hell broke loose when even the carrier was confident the delivery did not make the van in time to be shipped . oooooohhhh no i will have to take tomorrow off !
positive	excellent !
neutral	what a nuisance having 0 small packets of tablets in a much too large box .
positive	not happened with viovet - price , service and reliability has remained totally constant .
negative	not to mention this brand_new rip_off called " be more dog " or " refresh " where customers ( the stupid ones ) can do an early upgrade if they want to loosing their discounts that would come at the end of their contract .
positive	i purchased the beanbag as a gift for my niece who had her baby .
positive	will_definitely be ordering from them again .
negative	use at your own_peril f - 0 / 0
neutral	i purchased a sailor '_s hat for an adult fancy_dress party and it is practically a child '_s sized hat .
positive	was i happy with the lense , yes i was , and would pick this lense again , but , im still thinking_about the 000mm or 000mm next time .
negative	please email support @ myukdelivery . co . uk
neutral	i do not have the sort of job where i can take time off for deliveries and i found the city_link website and phone number extremely unhelpful .
neutral	thankfully the canna lilies were the important flowers for the occasion .
neutral	i can only surmise that this type of misuse has caused the damage ."
neutral	i feel olotels were too slow to act and this is why i lost out .
positive	prompt dispatch and delivery .
negative	brilliant i thought , good job shopto .
positive	great price for the watch and extremely fast delivery !
negative	they post fake and defamatory reviews about your company and once the bad review appears in google they contact you to offer their services ( often pretending to be a seo company ) to remove the fake review .
negative	speaking to customer_services did not help , they were simply repeating that i have ordered the movie , that i have gone in contract and that i have to read " terms & conditions ".
negative	i found the bed i wanted online , on sale , however i decided to go to my local_branch to order as i was hoping to see one on display ( which it wasn_'_t unfortunately ).
neutral	the item arrived at 0pm thursday_afternoon only 0_days late !!
negative	be warned !
positive	he was indeed the first person in this nightmare who actually instilled_confidence .
negative	i had to call twice and pay a lot for that . and when the product i orderd that i wanted was no_longer in stock , they didn_'_t give me anything as a apology .
neutral	i explained i had already had a text to say delivery will be 00 / 0 / 00 and then another stating between 0 - 00am .
positive	great prices , great range , great service and fast delivery .
neutral	also charged for 0 deliveries .
positive	absolutely_delighted with service provided by dentocare .
positive	satisfaction levels were very good .
negative	after several appalling attempts of apologies i gave up and cancelled my order .
negative	have i been lucky before or is this a one - off problem ?
neutral	it '_s heavier_than i expected but it seems to be robust .
positive	000_% genuine !
positive	!
negative	stoll waiting
positive	so often internet purchases let you down one way or another .
negative	0 .
positive	i prefer to the likes of boots , who i find are over priced to be honest .
neutral	i was looking for a double_buggy for when my second child is born in jan , but found it cheaper on another website , precious_little_ones was very easy to do a price match and better that price .
neutral	when i rang to sort this out , i was told that it was very clear in the ordering process ( in the price drop - down when selecting the delivery option ) at the timing .
neutral	one of our blinds came in a damaged box and when i turned it up one way all the screws fell out .
negative	i was told that the goods should reach me by 00 may .
neutral	again i argued that if they couldn_'_t find a vehicle for me , what were the chances of me finding one !
neutral	just warn but so far so good .
neutral	we are fitting these items in about 0 days so we will see if they are satisfactory .
positive	will be using them again .
neutral	but on the rental paper_work it said that when adding another driver it would not be more than $ 0 dollar the exact price was less_than this amount so i thought great i will add my wife to it when i arrive !!!
positive	i would definitely buy from natureshop again .
neutral	i usually know exactly_what i want from currys so have only had to ask for advice a couple of times .
neutral	why did you send me 0 different products ?
negative	which clearly_states on there site they have not delivered it and still have not refunded since 00rd_april when parcel was due 00 days ago .
negative	the sunday delivery was important as ( a ) the wedding was saturday so no disturbances with deliveries were wanted ( b ) sunday was the actual birthday and off course mothers_day , and ( c ) we were all leaving monday so nobody would be there .
neutral	the initial_quote then appeared to be misleading .
neutral	i had had some email correspondence from their customer_services department , but was basically thinking i '_d been_scammed , and then , after about 0_weeks , i started to get emails implying that the sunglasses might actually be on their way .
positive	i sent the phone off using the label i printed online .
positive	i would have no_issues and would order from them again .
neutral	i then emailed and then received a response with revised delivery date .
positive	every order comes with superb next_day free delivery service .
neutral	the ordering was simple , the item arrived in good time & as far as i can see , there '_s nothing wrong with it .
positive	price was very good as well .
negative	i was amazed when we were refused_entry because we didnt have i . d .
positive	i found them very friendly , i could have bought a lot but they made me bought what i needed which i found very gratful -- i will recomend them to all my friends .
positive	i phoned yanis for advice on their latex toppers and on their advice , ordered the luxury version .
neutral	i only got half a pence_per_litre saving so , i don_'_t know if i '_ll use the website again for ordering , but will_continue to use it for comparison .
neutral	slow process and still_haven_'_t got my cheque after 00 days !
negative	i ordered my item on the 00 december and as it said 0 / 0 day delivery and it was in stock i thought it would have arrived before christmas , it did not arrive so i emailed them twice , i must_admit i did receive one email back , but not very helpful i kept looking to see if it had been dispatched , but no it kept saying awaiting dispatch , although the money had been taken from my account on the day ordered as other people have already said .
neutral	we rented a nice new ford_fiesta diesel on the internet for a price of 000 danish kroner for a week .
negative	the final item was a set of pc speakers .
positive	very pleased with my new power_shower .
negative	its been 0_months since my kitchen arrived and im missing half of it , and in all that time they have sent me one door !!
negative	within an_hour money was refunded though it took nearly three_days for the money to actually credit back to my account .
neutral	sent some things off and got a credit_note email quickly .
positive	great price too .
positive	a pleasure to deal with .
negative	having paid a lot of money for two big bunches , i was horrified to find that neither arrived on the delivery day .
neutral	would happily use them to book our holiday .
negative	but over the last four months we have been inundated with sales calls and sales texts .
neutral	appart from the wait it was all ok i suppose for the price !
negative	so they knowingly overcharge people and knowingly decieve people about stock ( that could ruin a late birthday ) and take days to repsond .
negative	their staff all worship the ground talk_talk walk on and their communication with bt open_reach is awful .
neutral	i have used your service before and found it great , so was a bit gutted as i am worried the computer could have been damaged in transit by the time it arrived at my door .
positive	!
neutral	doesn_'_t make me look too good when a bouquet arrives for our ( 00nd !!!)
neutral	however it did take 0_days for them to contact me to say the product didn_'_t have the box as_described .
positive	the sales co - ordinators were always cheerful and helpful .
negative	!
negative	!
positive	very reasonably_priced delivered quickly sometimes no postage prices
neutral	when the confirmation_email is sent saying goods have been despatched there seems to be a delay in them getting to the carrier , sometimes it takes two_days before the carrier shows any tracking .
positive	absolutely excellent service - quick dispatch .
negative	i tried again the next_day and got through after 00_minutes - to be told " oh i guess something went wrong - nothing we can do except reschedule "
positive	i brought a pair of good quality so and would recommed this site to everyone
positive	would have appreciated a note on how to wear the belt eg which position in order to maximise effectiveness .
negative	i e_- mailed the customer service , after 00 days i got a reply and all it kept going on about was the returns_policy for unsuitable gifts .
neutral	the salesman gave_me the full spiel regarding polish , aftercare and replacement policy as if i was buying a full bedroom_suite , etc .
neutral	the price was good and the items showed as in stock .
neutral	i specifically ordered springtime basket as it included daffodils and narcissi as these are my mother '_s favourite flowers .
positive	so thank_you very much .
positive	you really can '_t get better !
neutral	the flowers where badly_damaged , the packaging was ugly with soggy brown_paper wrapped around the flowers and the bunch was very small .
positive	straight returns are charged only a nominal_fee for postage .
positive	that '_ll do .
positive	all in all , a very good service .
neutral	overall i would try them again if i was looking to rent again .
positive	i sent my son a personalised bottle of champagne , he had just got a big promotion , and has he lives so far away from home i thought it would be a special surprise for him .
neutral	in the end a family friend who was visiting found the flowers and brought them in .
negative	i booked a delivery at 0 . 00am on tuesday_morning , for collection by weds 0pm .
neutral	the service from the staff was great .
neutral	the glasses arrived but i was shocked to find that both of the lenses in the regular glasses had come out of the frames !!
positive	the order arrived in a timely_fashion , was well_packaged and all in all was a seamless_transaction .
negative	as above i did but no response from them .
positive	very good service and excellent price
negative	never answered the phone to respond to query .
negative	original offer £_000 and new offer £_00 .
positive	a store visit , excellent quality at a great price .
positive	great choice , and items in stock . unlike_other kitchenaid sellers i looked at .
negative	i wrote to them at_least ten times and all they said was " tough " well tough on you tiscali , here '_s my review of you
neutral	the flower got on time but i asked and paid for a cristal base and they delivered them without a base .
negative	i was told if i couldn_'_t help then he would have to take it away !
neutral	i like topcashback but some things make me not bother with it sometimes !, like the amount of time it takes for cashback to become pay and you are able to withdraw it !
positive	fast delivery everytime .
negative	yet they were holding money from my account .
neutral	that seemed to put me on some kind of a map , and i was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their ' friend '.
negative	!
negative	only bad_reviews everywhere .
neutral	i cannot currently think of any other questions i would refer to an online advisor for this company but if any come up i will be avoiding them .
neutral	emailed but was informed that i couldn_'_t change the delivery address from anything other than the payment address to help prevent fraud .
neutral	i think they should put on your account redeemed when been redeemed , then mistakes won_'_t be made
neutral	i still find that unacceptable : if it isn_'_t in stock , it * mustn '_t * say " in stock ".
positive	would definitely recommend this company for quality , value for money and service .
negative	the customer service team are not very helpful , they fail to respond to emails and are impolite if you actually manage to speak to someone .
neutral	e_- mail confirmation is quick and a tracking_number provided , which is useful .

positive	can '_t fault it !
positive	the pricing of the products was better_than the competition and the quality for the price is excellent .
positive	from my initial_contact with away0 , through to a successful booking , daniel mednick '_s delivery and approach has_been friendly , committed and diligent .
neutral	the flowers were left on their pathway in full view of the road with happy birthday written on the box , and could easily have been taken before my parents realised they were outside .

neutral	it was very dark and not brightly lit and we had to sign to agree that there were no marks on the car before he would let us take it .
neutral	but - don_'_t add the booking_fee art the end - be honest and either include it in your prices ( it '_s not as if it '_s an optiona ; extra ) or show it up front .
negative	" the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."

negative	00 dec e_mail received in the evening saying item not available - did i want an_alternative ?
neutral	the merchandise was not quite as expected so more information on their website would have been helpful .
negative	she said she could take details of the complaint and a manager would ring me back within 00_hours .
neutral	i '_ve not yet booked my return_journey .)
positive	i would like to point out , and this is not a complaint - it it is an awareness issue - my daughter is deaf , and she once booked a similar arrangement , but was unable to call and ended_up paying extra for parking .
positive	once is stock it was delivered straight_away .
negative	the response from head_office in london was " this is a franchise operation , therefore we have no say in the way they operate ".
negative	never again .
negative	never responded to e_- mail for 0 - 0 days , and even then never understaood the issue of delivering so late in the day .
positive	the flowers have always been lovely and well received .
positive	happy days !
negative	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
neutral	luckily all items were still inside and nothing had been damaged .
neutral	finally it '_s a bit_annoying when you receive a discount_voucher offering cheaper parking 0 day after booking !
positive	the flowers ordered were exactly as shown on the website and , as they weren_'_t for me i was emailed at every_step of their journey with sweet messages , perfect
positive	thanks .
negative	i am still_waiting for a proper reply and a refund of the cost of the missing chocolates .
positive	well_done team .
positive	it was simple to use and i found the feedback and rating facility invaluable in trying to make a choice .
positive	i will surely use you again
neutral	the fact they only use parcel_force for delivery is a big minus for me - as parcel_force are notoriously bad service and very inconvenient and un - trackable .
neutral	macaroon bars were excellent
neutral	i ordered a small item from this company to give them a trial before ordering a bathroom_suite .
positive	wow i was desperate for what my daughter would put on but thank god for trustpillot , their products are perfect my daughter was very happy getting a cheer leader dress and the pom_poms that come with it , oh just a mazing .
negative	i '_ve_used pcworld over the years for the simple reason there are few alternative stores close to where i live .
positive	gardening 0 less was one of the first ads up so looked in & found just what we wanted , the bonus being it was on offer .
neutral	the only good thing is that it `_s cheap .
negative	really disappointed and it '_s not the first time i '_ve been messed over by yodel .
neutral	hi we only brought this as a gift for our anervirsey and to make our flat look better
neutral	the main bathroom is damp & smells musty , the jacuzzi bath , one of the selling points of the villa , doesn_'_t work !
negative	on opening the parcel i found they ' d sent the wrong model so i rang them ( 0000 premium line so i '_m paying to report their error ! )
negative	marked bordering on rusty so iwas well p **** d off i couldnt get up to play ;;; they were dud my mate said they in fact they are probably old stock ???
positive	. again , a response within the hr fro .
neutral	for me a sad passing of an era really , 0000 - 0000 rip
negative	then , trying to arrange for me to collect from their_offices was a complete_joke .
negative	?
negative	she then_proceeded to tell me she would contact the florist via_email and get back to me by the end of today .
positive	shower cartridge arrived the next_day and was fitted there and then - really easy .
positive	sadly i just need more money to buy all the bits i want !
negative	absolutely useless customer service .
positive	great site
negative	they don_’_t reply to any emails at all , i have reported these to south end trading_standards and consumer direct these are getting investigated now by outside forces
positive	took just 00_hours to reach me .
neutral	i will always buy my perfume from you but maybe i would be reluctant to buy perfume i would want to gift .
positive	customer experiance was first_rate and i will used blackcircles again !
neutral	despite the response from ecco , i '_ve yet to hear back from them on this matter .
positive	i found just what i wanted .
neutral	as a returning customer a confidently placed an order on 00 / 00 / 00 for delivery on 0 / 0 / 00 .
positive	ordered a couple of bottles of alcohol and they were dispatched swiftly and very well_packaged .
negative	will not be using again .
positive	i will_definitely use this site again
neutral	a quick check over and a wipe with a duster would definitely have helped with the overall appearance and my satisfaction !
positive	great service .
negative	the man told me he was making notes and this would be possible .
negative	still_waiting .
negative	no card was put through the door ( or perhaps it was put through the wrong door ) - the shop put the box in a hot windowless room and we were not aware it was there .
neutral	the orders had been mixed up and my order had indeed been processed and there was no problem with it .
positive	i purchased loake_shoes , which is a quality product .
positive	kept me informed on progress of order .
neutral	i just mentioned that i could do with one of the items and jackie immediately arranged for a sample of the product to be sent out to me by first_class_post .
negative	they damaged 0 of my bags and called them not fit for purpose , even_though they were as new condition .
neutral	bookibg was for 00 feb . booking was confirmed by email .
negative	the flowers were no cheaper_than interflora and if i '_ve ever had any_problems with any if their deliveries then i do not get a dismissive email in response .
neutral	flowers delivered before 00am ( as paid for ).
negative	this kind of " after " sales service is appalling , not to mention illegal and against their owm policies / terms & conditions .
negative	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
neutral	so in summary , use them , know what you ' re getting but have a back up plan .
neutral	this did not happen and i only realised my item was missing when i received the delivery dispatch email .
neutral	left it a few more days .
positive	very simple and hassle_free .
neutral	agent unable to discuss issue just arranged an exchange , and if still incorrect , a refund .
negative	they have made no attempt to contact me with an update .
negative	so they haven_'_t even been packaged , let_alone sent out !
negative	even_though this was their fault , had to waste another day waiting for delivery .
positive	glasses used to give me headaches , contact_lenses were really uncomfortable , would dry my eyes out , and make me feel really tired but i don_'_t have any of these problems any more .
positive	everything in the apartment was first_class - a major asset was the large hot_tub on the roof top terrace .
neutral	i think the price was expensive for just what was basically cheese and biscuits .
neutral	but delivery is a mess .
negative	ce_n ' est_pas dégâts d ' accident .
neutral	by monitoring the web_site i was able to watch how the first proposed in - stock date was moved 0 times !
positive	not the largest order was placed but i was treated as if i was a ' big ' customer .
negative	tried to buy jewellery at end of nov .
negative	réponse à votre commentaire : pourquoi me notifier que votre service clientèle se tient à_ma disposition sachant que_la conseillère querelleuse avec qui j ' ai_été en contact lors_de_cette commande m ' a spécifiquement dit que_le service clientèle n ' avait rien_à voir avec_l ' e_- commerce dior ?
negative	in my opinion their whole_operation should be fully investigated by the energy_ombudsman .
negative	again selectspecs refused to refund what were clearly faulty items , even when i took the case up with trading_standards !
neutral	again always friendly and a really nice person but i had chased the work up 0 times by phone and text_messages .
negative	on asking the person why they hadn_'_t consulted the tps list , they accused me of being rude .
positive	whybuynew is the best for service , products and reliability .
positive	no delivery charge .
negative	lets_see what sort of response , appology , recompense , good old_fashioned customer service i get because at present it looks highly unlikely !
positive	many_thanks .
positive	the process of just placing one simple shipping note onto a parcel is perfect for me .
negative	received bed and the side_panels where damaged and assembly pack was missing , phoned up and was told that the items will be dispatched . side_panels arrived but the assembly kit was missing so phoned up again to be told it will have to be sent again . finally received assembly kit and two of the bolts were missing i didn_'_t bother phoning up because i was fed_up having the bed for so long i went and purchased the two bolts myself .
neutral	if it can '_t be delivered by then a refund for the paid amount is sufficient .
negative	we are now in april and although i left my old supplier 0th_december_0000 i still do not know my account number , i still don_'_t have a direct_debit set_up and have now got a bill which they still have not sent me and cannot tell me how much it is over the phone .
neutral	technology is basic but is good / straightforward as you ' d expect so 0 - 0 minutes to book on a collection .
neutral	then to top it all i have had to write to dfds on my return from holiday to claim expenses and i am still_waiting !!!
negative	i have not receive my item its been nearly two_weeks since i placed the order , never again , i just want my money back .
negative	he has no idea what is going on and hides_behind that as an excuse .
positive	je_commande régulièrement sur northern_parrot , et_j ' en suis très_satisfaite .
negative	call_centre aren_'_t in touch with the products being offered and i had to instruct them where to look on their own website .
positive	good price
negative	several emails later not received confirmation for delivery .
negative	the call_centre staff are also a bunch of liars and clearly love to annoy people on the phone b y replying to all criticism as " just read our terms and conditions ".
positive	the range of styles and brands is massive and i would definitely shop_here first in the future for sunglasses , as they are also a lot_cheaper_than standard stores .
positive	easy website , quick process of ordering , very quick delivery and good communication , in other words a joy to use .
negative	avoid if possible .
negative	extremely poor customer_services quality - worst i ever had in the uk .
negative	just by_chance i looked into the tracking .
neutral	so we see how it goes :) my iva was quick and simple to sort_out with the help they gave_me about 0_weeks it took
positive	i even got replies on a weekend .
neutral	the website as usual is easy to use and easy to find what i want .
negative	thoroughly distgusted .
negative	waited in all day till be told the courier had been and didnt have a up to date phone number for me or didnt have company phone !!
negative	after i complained to the merchant i ordered the items , they replied " it must have been a miscommunication "!
neutral	this time the customer service representative sorted my order in a couple of minutes .
negative	i bought 0 camping beds that sweated when i slept on them ending with them soaking_wet .
neutral	i '_ve had walking boot from them that have started to fall_apart in a week , and others that will probably outlive me !
positive	in the words of one of the major_retailers ' every little helps ' - so every time you make any sort of purchase - make_sure first you go through_topcashback and you can earn back cash , be it a few_pence , a few_pounds or even a few_hundred_pounds .
neutral	customer service not brilliant but have now received book and very pleased with end_result .
positive	m0s is a very reliable producer , with a high_quality products .
negative	so , i got scared that i end up with no car because of the season and overpaid .
positive	excellent value for money and great service .
negative	if it '_s on hold " for my protection " why did they charge the card ?
negative	well i am in , and have been in all morning .
neutral	waited over two_weeks for my order .
negative	really liked a sanderson design ashbee in antique gold after_seeing it in the sales locally .
neutral	i was told that the order would be delivered to a fitter who would in turn deliver it to our fitter who was due come on thursday 00th – only for a box of parts to be delivered to me on wednesday 00th .
negative	bit of a shame but it '_s written in the equivalent of mandarin chinese .
neutral	at the same time , received an_apology from md , which was nice , but it took a paypal complaint case to get it .
neutral	paypal is a very convenient method of payment .
negative	customer service is none existent , if you call it is premium_rate so don_'_t do it !!!
neutral	this overcomes the objection of buying clothes over the internet , but your brand_name is being compromised by selling sub dickies clothes bought in for sales .
negative	if you call the store , they ask you to contact customer_services which is an indian based call_centre . great .
neutral	suggest other customers check the wood matches before cutting it !
negative	i have also tried_contacting them 0 times on facebook and twice they have deleted my wall posts and have not responded to my status including them .
neutral	heart in my mouth worrying .
negative	i have bought bouquets from morrisons for a quarter of the price that have lasted four times longer before dying .
neutral	the tracking website details are not that useful .
negative	i paid a large_amount for next_day delivery for the privilege .
negative	my mother then explained again and again and still gave her the same answer .
neutral	delivery excellent , do not expect as much when returning items .
negative	funnily_enough , about 0 months later , i looked out of the rear patio_doors to find a scruffy yellow bag in the middle of the lawn .
positive	thanks
neutral	we asked what our options were and were told either a full_refund and find our own way home .
positive	but i think that is more of a problem at sagepay than rughouse as i have had problems with that before .
negative	david : in the end its yodels loss , i will write lots of reviews and post them , you will lose my business and many others for the incompetence yodel has shown .
negative	the tablets were ok but the laptop i wanted and ordered was suddenly out of stock .
positive	the service was excellent .
negative	it is now late september and multiple stalling emails from vd reveal they have lost my glasses in hong_kong .
positive	website easy to use and goods were delivered the following_day
positive	i ordered an item for my girlfriend for her_birthday , from the moment the order was placed mails were arriving informing_me of the items progress .
negative	why would twice as many valentine '_s flowers make up for it , when it '_s not valentine '_s day any more ?!
negative	i am extremely disappointed in the service i received .
negative	so where '_s my free upgraded flowers ?
positive	there web_site is so user_friendly , ordering is so easy first time and then just a one click order after that .
neutral	i have used storagemart since 0000 since_moving back to england .
positive	i hadn_'_t gone into household handles premises because i just assumed they would be dear .
neutral	otherwise the delivery was fine , but the internet site should be more realistic to avoid_disappointment .
negative	checked with my bank , money taken twice by wowcher .
positive	no_messing_around , and significantly_cheaper_than some of the prices i had been quoted .
neutral	expected to receive the rug within a week or two as per confirmation , but nothing arrived .
negative	i have contacted you before about this order .
neutral	i am a little disappointed that the ferrule on the coopers walking_stick ( ccs0000 ) has already broken with only 0 days use .
positive	have ordered supplements from other_companies but this has_been the best service i have received .
positive	some of those were recently released games as well .
neutral	hopefully this was a one off .
negative	wouldn_'_t use amazon for an enemy '_s presents , wouldn_'_t buy anything from them again .
positive	it was a pleasure to meet him .
negative	ordered a laser tape_measure on 00 oct . on 00 oct i phoned for a refund as the web_site still says my item has not been fullfilled .
neutral	they did improve slighty but i had imagined a rather larger array .
positive	mr & mrs clay ( poulton le fylde )
negative	still no reply , cant book a voucher , restaurant don_'_t want to know and refer you back to wowcher !!
positive	bought a b_& d mouse sander which was missing a part .
neutral	once the pack is opened the capsules do not have any external indication as to strength of coffee inside .
positive	provides amazing support post fractured fib
positive	i have just been speaking to her on the phone ( she is in uk and i am in new_zealand ) and she said they ' re beautiful , and so well_presented .
positive	i have ordered this product [ lubrithal ] for my dogs eyes a few_times it arrives within 0 - 0days so for me thats a good service and i will_continue to use best pet for my dogs needs keep_up the good work .
neutral	as things stand i am hesitant to repeat the experience as i am able to shop more efficiently elsewhere .
neutral	just to cancel the items was not satisfactory .
negative	i have read feedback on this site and a lot of it is negative , which is bad_news for the brand , but they appear to not care as they keep_repeating the same bad customer service and poor business mistakes .
positive	prompt delivery of order .
positive	delivery great .
negative	one month i used 000 ish mb .
neutral	however , due to the time of year it was impractical as i was hoping it would be thicker - no fault of stand - out .
positive	oakland was 0st_class on everything from ordering on line they kept you in the loop all the way to the time off delivery and you cant_knock the quickness of the delivery men would deffantly shop_here again & again & again .
positive	as the title_suggests , they are nearly always the cheapest , never get to hotel to find booking isn_'_t made .
neutral	on closer_inspection , however , the t shirts were too short and after a couple of washes on 00 degree wash they had shrunk even more and had gone out of shape .
neutral	time will tell how long they last .
negative	so , in summary , nice stores and nice salesmen , but no support .
positive	the price was very reasonable and it arrived next_day .
negative	purchased a corner_suite back in december_0000 and took delivery in march_0000 .
negative	i eventually received my order on the 0rd_july almost a month after paying for them .
neutral	there is also the hassle of getting to a bank to pay the cheques in and having to wait a further 0 working_days to clear , so if you are in a hurry for your money . think again !
neutral	we were told that the difference was because of late flight , diesel on the car and insurance !
positive	i routinely price up and compare products , but keep_coming_back to this company !
neutral	when they were returned to school after the first term , the blue had turned to pink !
neutral	i will recommend to all my friends .
negative	granted they do offer apparently good frames at a resonable price .
positive	the part arrived on time in great condition and my car passed it '_s mot !.
negative	!
positive	without going into my personal finances , 0_weeks_later the task was completed and all monies transferred .
negative	i '_ve ordered tyres through blackcircles for more than 00 years and for a variety of our family '_s cars .
neutral	i phoned showerseal twice and emailed them four times over several weeks with a picture of my broken shower rollers , asking whether the product i had identified from the website was a suitable replacement .
positive	thank_you
neutral	- pricing policy is a joke .
negative	they told me that sometimes a van driver can be delayed and it might be as late as 0pm before anyone arrived .
positive	i have used this service on several_occasions , and it has always been excellent .
positive	website easy to use and packed with fun , fab useful things .
negative	i was shocked my phone was bought from new so i challenged the rep over the phone and he finally said he would get back to me in 00_hours . hmm u guessed it no call was returned so i called again and this time i was told the delay was solely due to the fault of apple and that i was told the unlock_code will take 00 days so i should be patient okay i said i understood that but i was basically told by a previous advisor that the code was going to be sent on a specific date and was also told that my phone was stolen so got a bit_worried .
negative	i decided to email envirophone only to be told i am not receiving the payment until 00 . 00 . 00 , 0_weeks after i started this whole_process .
positive	what a simple site and great value parking
positive	excellent service all_round .
neutral	colour is not a good representation online pictures .
neutral	i looked on the net and they all look so lovely .
positive	good battries at great price .
neutral	not impressed
neutral	that says it all , for such a high postage for such a small item , would have expected overnight first_class post .
positive	they had what i wanted in stock , i ordered it on - line and i received it the next_day , and at a price that cannot be_beaten .
neutral	credit_card bill comes and is £ 0 more_expensive involving time_consuming calls to credit_card company .
negative	after 0 days i contacted them to find out what had happened to my order , was told to get back in contact if the item had ' nt arrived within 00 days .
neutral	yep tyres there as ordered , premises look tired toilet needs pressure wash and coat of paint , preferred time appointment as only one tyre bay , fitter had bad back some time taken to do change longer_than_expected they should have change rolls with others for day to rest his back or should be off sick not the cheapest price as per advert out side but suited my purpose for day not sure if torque tool used . a little motivation for the crew would assist customer_relations and perceptions no friction involved so rating should be 0 * plus would be better
positive	so glad we brought that samsung , excellent price .
positive	however , after the shock of the first bill i decided to try and source the product at a better price .
neutral	like all web sites one should always search for and read the small_print !
neutral	you advertise the fact that if the customer is out keys etc can be left and the work completed .
negative	i trusted their estimate and got money from insurers for a new frame and eventually got around to buying a new one .
neutral	two_days_later i received an e_- mail saying that the the additional items were out of stock and they would be in at the end of the week , and the whole order would be despatched then .
positive	with lenstore i almost always receive them within 0_days .
positive	cannot_fault the ease of the website , the forms and the service .
neutral	some small issues after completion , bbe weren_'_t interested , they had their money and won_'_t like to upset the developer possible loss of new clients no doubt .
neutral	what we actually got was a single bed and three tier bunk_bed .
neutral	just work on ensuring your website displays the right stock details .
negative	episode 0 - i bought an ipad on november 00 and received an email_confirming i could pick_up the item at the local_branch after an_hour .
neutral	the highlands and islands are a distince and well defined area .
neutral	the same day , a different person from the customer_services team called me and did not seem to " get it " either until i explained myself again to her .
negative	and for the price charged we could have bought a nicer and larger_bouquet from another retailer and then not had the hassle of them not turning_up .
neutral	no instructions , but finally , after three_weeks , the shower did arrive .
neutral	i would be happy to rate you well but i haven_'_t received the goods yet even_though i paid for one of them them on the 00th of april and the other on the 00th of april - i have had no contact to say the items have been delayed or they have delayed one to send both together , so until they arrive i have no quality or other comment to make
neutral	if transfers are only made at a certain point in the month ( to keep down bacs charges ) ted_baker should make it known when these are .
negative	david : goodbye yodel , one huge let - down , one joke of a company , one parcel sent and one big_mistake .
negative	now we can not get our refund as it is apparently too difficult to give the refund for orders ordered online !!!
negative	today is the 00nd of april .
positive	the delivery men ' phoned 00_minutes before their arrival .
negative	00 days_later , still no refund .
positive	excellent
positive	i started_using a courier because so many of our parcels sent by normal mail have gone_missing and never reached my sister .
neutral	in discussions with the dollar_rental staff they stated the rental code ' fleur ' required the purchase of a full_tank of gas with no option to opt for returning the car in the same fuel state as when hired .
positive	postage is reasonable and items are well_packaged and delivered extremely quickly .
negative	i have also spent hours emailing or ringing them , to say nothing of not having the use of the item !
negative	i '_ve dropped $_000 after this point .
positive	j ' ai_reçu mes articles très_bien emballés ( c ' était fragile ) pas_de casse , rapidement .
neutral	received email_confirmations and tracking_numbers .
negative	and to think you pay £_00 more per_tyre ( so nearly_£_000 more for a set ) than getting them shipped from oponeo . co . uk and paying your local_fitter direct , because they are a " premium " service that is hassle_free .
neutral	i hear it ’_s going to be cold this winter and this will keep me warm while out and about .
positive	i assumed that as it has_been over 0_weeks i could not send the one i have back to you .

positive	less_than a week_ago , we ordered two powertech foldaway electric communter bikes .

negative	simply dreadful service , sent me an imei blocked mobile , then after having me running around to ee then agreed it was their problem and took the phone back , after advising me to send the phone back to them with my original sim_card , they sent me a replacement phone out without a sim !!
positive	they ring you while on your way to the airport and then text you on your return , which all adds to the service in my opinion .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	it did not .
negative	this company is impossible to contact by phone or e_- mail - you can not get through by phone and they do not respond to emails sent .
positive	couldn_'_t fault the company at all .
neutral	came out into the reception_area she asked_him a question concerning print times .
positive	i could collect when convenient to me , rather_than having to stay at home to sign .
positive	sample service has_been great , order one day , receive the next !
positive	they don_'_t say ' maybe ' as some other_sites do , they give a price that they really mean .
negative	i was then told i would be called before 00 . 00 next_day by both the call_centre and email .
positive	the website made getting the fight lens easy .
positive	didn_'_t even charge more for slightly more_expensive choice !
neutral	store said it is not in yet we will ring you .

negative	ordered 0 pairs of glasses .

negative	i have been left with no option but too return this jumper as customer_services sayn have too look into this # now my daughter who isnt well at moment didnt get her new year gift as item sent too_big and everywhere_else sold out of xs !!!!!!!!!!
neutral	i was unable to speak directly to actual person to explain that rescheduling the delivery is pointless unless i can speak to the delivery driver about times .
positive	happy from_start to finish .
neutral	i have never had a really bad_experience .
negative	so i took it back to a cpw shop , where the trouble began .
negative	i did this within an_hour of them responding to me and it is now the 00nd nov and i have had nothing back from them .
positive	feedem is the only place i can buy a specific product i need for my dogs which i can '_t get locally any more .
neutral	we paid £_00 . 00 for them now they are £_00 and the children '_s have increased a lot too .
positive	i was really impressed by the quick delivery of my fitflops .
neutral	i would have been out of pocket by £_00 . 00 and still no near to sorting_out my original problem .
neutral	it wasnt specified before purchasing that i would need a home printer to print a label .
negative	we have had a refund on postage but not on the product .
negative	on 00th_april_0000 ( 00 days since order ) still no sign of watch i therefore raised ' a support ticket ' to find out what was happening , asking why it was taking so long , why web did not show when out of stock , what did they mean by beginning / middle of next week etc . etc .
negative	i also contacted my local constabulary and made an official_complaint about this company .
negative	no one was available and i was told i ' d be called back within 00_hours .
positive	how many_times have you heard " tried to deliver today but no one in " when you '_ve been home all day !

neutral	i ordered 0 packs at a specially reduced rate , but when they came i found i ' d been charged the full rate .
negative	i received no dispatch information so wrote to spoiled brat to query the delay .
positive	definitely 0_stars !
neutral	in future i will phone the agent direct as he provides a much_better and immediate service .
positive	i was in the shop for over an_hour and was met by a very helpfull man that went through every thing from what was wrong to what would help totally brilliant i also had a free 00 minute trial on a mobiliser which i have to say wasn_'_t the most pleasent_experience to start with but boy did it work i felt taller and free to move after just this one session !
positive	excellent puma_golf shirt .
negative	it took three emails before they finally accepted that i wanted my money back .
positive	i emailed gak and had a response from mike fallon who told me how to check the web_site for availability .
neutral	so now i drop them off at another corner_shop that i know has larger store space .
neutral	all went fine until i tried to use paypal from here in australia and your connection was rejected .
neutral	i had to phone again , this time she did reply , the shower was not in stock .
negative	for that reason , i '_m not paying a penny .
neutral	if i could change flight online i would give 0_stars , however this experience may result in me booking further flights for my company direct with the airline .
neutral	everything_went well until i was given an activation date .
negative	i bought michael mcintyre tickets almost a year before the event at wembley arena , and spent over_£_000 on 0 tickets .

positive	i have placed 0 orders now , both were received within a couple of day .
neutral	and they will ignore any claims you make if any of the items of the shipment was damaged , so if it something broke in your shipment , good luck hearing back from them .
neutral	order system not clear .
neutral	then received an email_saying that there was a delay with the order .
negative	i will merely contact my bank and tell them to backcharge ee .
positive	the pricing is very competitive and the enquiry and after sales second to non .
negative	she called the other store to confirm they did have a shower in stock , told them to hang onto it and she would arrange to get it to the leicester store , some way , by close of business .
neutral	excellent service from jokers_masquerade though : 0 )
negative	an absolutely shambolic service and complete_lack of customer service - i will not be recommending this company to anyone .
neutral	they were offering the product that i was buying a slightly cheaper price and i thought that i would give it a go .
neutral	managed to get all three dvd '_s to play on my computer but it wasn_'_t easy .
positive	thank_you
negative	bad management , giving out spurious delivery information , out of date working practises , bargain_basement infrastructure , high staff turn over , cutting own throat with internet parcel firms as customers , and the majority of staff not caring a toss possibly make them the worst courier firm in the world
positive	my experience started over a year_ago and i '_m still a faithful customer , not once with any cause to complain .
positive	every one fitted_perfectly , extremely well made and excellent quality .
positive	ordered on line , contacted me to confirm order then email to confirm delivery with a tracking_number and a link , link showed on the delivery day a 0 hour delivery spot for me , delivered right in the middle of the slot . job sorted
positive	staff were there to meet us on arrival , and we only waited about 0 minutes upon_arrival back into manchester .

negative	c ) phone trading_standards as soon as they breach 00 days ( i . e .
neutral	however , interlink_express simply failed to deliver and sent me an email with the usual baloney that there was nobody in to collect the parcel .
negative	so again , i have to correct these people - stop pointing the finger , get your facts straight , and find my stuff .
negative	but 0 ) they managed to deliver the toner .
positive	ordered from toolstop at 0pm on monday_evening and items delivered weds morning and that was free delivery thanks again toolstop and will definetley be using again

negative	someone_else '_s parcel was delivered to me , then picked_up again .
positive	!
negative	very disappointed to say the least .
neutral	easy to put up but the large width of the blind i got didn_'_t seem to work very well , 0 screws holding the whole blind in place makes it tricky when sliding the blind up and down it seems to come down ok but pushing it back up is a different_story it snagged quite a few_times pulling out of the side tracks and when these are going on windows in student_accommodation its a disaster waiting to happen maybe smaller blinds would work better .
negative	the agency had failed to tell her my requirements , wasting my time and hers .
negative	i asked jo who was head of customer_services and he didn_'_t know ?
positive	on time and delivered when promised - cinderella (_aka zombie convict ) did go to the halloween ball !

neutral	ordered on a tues as i needed it for friday_night .
neutral	your e_- mail told me it was coming monday .
negative	it caused myself and my friends a lot of inconvenience as their pets were needing the treatment urgently while i had to source flea_treatment from other_retailers .
neutral	the villa was clean but very basic in what it had to offer .
negative	00 days passed no sign of delivery , terrible .
neutral	however the parcel turned_up within 0_days and according to the tracking_system the original parcel is still in llandudno .
negative	just beware .
neutral	i recently went to tenerife with a friend and the company gave_me all i needed for a cheap flight and cheap accommodation .
positive	gak - what a fantastic service you provide . great quality products at affordable_prices .
positive	the order arrived promptly
neutral	it took me 0_days to work out how to use what i bought .
neutral	the lounge with wifi was just what we needed and the tea , coffee and drinks went down well .
positive	their service is second to none , with a very valuable bonus of free_postage to europe .
neutral	collect_+ tracking shows up the delays built into the mm system .
negative	days_later and no reply from selectspecs .
negative	i accepted the fact that they could not deliver next_day anymore ( order was placed shortly_after 0pm ).
positive	process couldn_'_t be easier and money transfer was flawless .
positive	excellent service --- plus !
positive	istanbul - what '_s a city !
negative	to wait a whole month for a refund with no communication sent to me is unacceptable .
negative	we decided that this year we wouldn_'_t have a holiday and instead save for home and garden improvements .
neutral	i was very happy with the price however when my item was delivered it was missing a cable therefore i ended_up spending a lot more than i wanted to and really regreted buying it .
positive	on saturday_morning i received another text_message to say my delivery would be approx 00_minutes .
positive	i was even provided with a cup of tea whilst i made my decision !
positive	parcel arrived quicker_than_expected , service excellent and would definitely buy again .
negative	i placed an order on 0rd february .
negative	i have called on 0 separate_occasions .
positive	ordered and recieved my order within 00_hours ,. deffo will use again thanx guys !
neutral	although fast delivery and i will wear my costume , it wasn_'_t worth the price .
neutral	not much help !!
negative	when i called back i was told there should be a calling_card but there wasn_'_t , but after a bit of pressure they agreed to redeliver on saturday before 000am .
neutral	beware also a noticeable snobbishness in favour of petrol and against electric models !
neutral	this was my first visit to wittards and there was a large variety of coffees and teas to choose from .
negative	so_far so good .
positive	speedy delivery .
positive	used once so_far , but item great , fast delivery would thoroughly_recommend .
negative	and of course , due to me telling cash_converters of the problem , they got it fixed and this other person was able to pay in the end and they left me high and dry without a care in the world , after spending 0 hours and £_00 on phone_calls to try buy the items myself as i had got there first .
negative	odd how when i review a cd to cassette adaptor from halfords which not only does not work but wrecks my car stereo into the bargain - the one star_review is not published .
positive	this was my first purchase from this company and i would happily purchase from them again .
neutral	i couldn_'_t get_hold of anyone on the number provided and i used the online form asking for someone to contact me , no - body ever got in touch .

negative	these_people have various flashy websites suggesting they have excellent customer service however they don_'_t .
neutral	yes product fine , but too slow on the postage !
positive	strings_direct don_'_t rip me off with excessive postal rates !
positive	well_done black_circle will have no_hesitation in using your service again
neutral	the skirt is lovely & i had planned on buying it in another colour .
negative	the parcel itself would have easily fitted through the letterbox and nothing was ever received .
neutral	directions would have helped .
negative	a couple of weeks_later i had to order an_alternative item .
negative	eflorist may be slightly cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
neutral	the roses had holes in the petals and they were dry and withered ,
neutral	disappointed that when i ordered , what they said on the website was available , i was told had to wait to get one item .
negative	i '_m tired of this company '_s broken_promises .
neutral	sds sell beautifully manufactured products at very reasonable prices , unfortunately the parcels are delivered by dpd who are utterly , utterly_useless .

positive	a great gift to get someone so they can treasure happy memories of a family event or showing kids growing up .
negative	unbeknown to me they never arrived , tried to track through the website but this service didn_'_t work .
positive	their price undercut all the opposition by a substantial_amount so i went_ahead and ordered it .
neutral	so was dishearted somewhat .
neutral	i have tried to get a re - delivery but know that they will probably deliver during the day again ( when i am at work !!)
negative	ive since sent it to them via_email 0 times yet you refuse to post my review .
positive	kept promises .
negative	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco '_s for £ 0 .
neutral	the flowers looked quite a bit smaller in life than i had imaged when iooking at the pictures .
neutral	thanks !!
negative	!
negative	want to be given no support , even when the terminals are not working in the manner they were sold to you ?
negative	excellent service from amazon , but useless at the moment as i have no camera .
positive	those that were in stock arrived within 00_hours .
neutral	if it were not for this , myprotein would be getting 0_stars !
negative	i received no communication about my order whatsoever other than an email_telling_me i had paid them !
positive	i got the best possible new lenses , from my preferred lens supplier ( hoya ) for much less_than i was quoted by my optician , with no_problems , and just as quickly .
positive	when compared to other_sites , prices are very competative .
negative	( with fresh flowers ) they say they have refunded the delivery charge and also the cost of the teddy_bear but after_reading all the reviews i '_ll believe it when / if it happens .
positive	i will look here first whenever i purchase anything again .
positive	bought via a deal in amazon which was fantastic value .
neutral	the flowers are meant to be taken out of packaging straight_away but instead spent the night outside suffering a torrential downpour .
negative	the retailer advised i needed to speak with wowcher as the original transaction .
neutral	wasted day and no communication to let us know the situation .
positive	i was very impressed with the flowers i ordered they were beautiful and very good value for money .
neutral	they need to use a better delivery company other than royal_mail
negative	the reply was no .
positive	i would highly_recommend using ' the outdoor and country store ', they have excellent service and customer_care .
negative	i will never shop_here again !
negative	i suggest that argos follow the example of other on line companies e . g .
positive	with in 0 days of using the glue mouse_traps , we were able to rid our house of 0 mice , caught within a few hours of each other .
neutral	i sent them a message as someone_else asking if they had stock to which they said they did so i asked them for my grip again .
positive	unfortunately onopening the box the dehumidifier was damaged , i contcted dry - it - out they immediately sent another unit and arranged for collection of the damaged unit .
positive	will certainly use them again !
negative	upon_receipt of order & notification of despatch , i ordered a further bouquet for my mother in law .
neutral	i re - ordered . and found myself receiving two items .

positive	fast delivery even over the christmas_period .
negative	were a wedding_anniversary_gift and very dissappointed .
positive	thanks for the friendly and quick service !
neutral	it is a dissapointing that i have been laboured with a postage charge that i believe should be refunded as it is not my fault the product failed and should not be held_responsible for delivery charge .
negative	the " country trug " filled with pale peach flowers looked just right for her , as did the lovely chocolates .
neutral	ordered the correct_size as per size_chart sheet on the website .
neutral	my only_gripe is that it takes too long to arrive .
positive	i ordered a pair of berghaus yeti extrem pro gaiters to replace a faulty pair that had split after only very light use ( refunded by amazon ).
neutral	now they are not covered for illness until 00 days time .
positive	i chose my new trees for their all_round seasonal interest , which the tree nursery explained really well in their description , in fact this helped_me to choose the correct trees for my garden .
neutral	it was a nice gift and arrived in good condition .
neutral	as a first time customer , not too impressed - regardless of how much i spent !!!
positive	i needed a free giveaway for an_exhibition i am attending , but also want to give the exhibiting franchisors some information about my company .

negative	i even booked a hotel from ebookers and did not get a good after sales services .
neutral	slow for the cars to come up , quicker to go on the bus to mid term
neutral	in the mean time i had to purchase protein_powder elsewhere while my order was pending , which put me further out of pocket .
positive	i complained to them and they even managed to screw up the complaint .
positive	emails kept me informed of it '_s progress .
negative	ordered a mural item was shipped 0_days ago still not received !
neutral	this was a bad deal for us as we didn_'_t use a full_tank .
negative	but at_least they live up to their name my parcel has defiantly gone .
positive	i was comparing various similar_sites .
positive	i sent a bottle of champange to a friend , it was extremely quick service and easy to use .
neutral	the idea is good and works well , but the final_outcome was not ideal

neutral	haven_'_t these people heard of research ?
positive	arrived on the correct day .
negative	last_year we ordered a cooker from appliances_online and was delivered with no_problems .

negative	eventually i got the goods 0_days_later !!!
negative	worst customer service ever !!
neutral	good service and nice people but website and photos of garments could be better
neutral	builders recommended bbe ( not good - conflict of interests ) i seemed to be kept out of the purchasing loop , to the point where the sales office on the development were updating me opposed to bbe .
neutral	all the tyre_pressures were low and i to inflate each tyre .
positive	!
negative	i will not be ordering from argento again until they sort their packaging out .
neutral	i got round it by routing an edge top and bottom
positive	ordered a bosch_sds_drill for a difficult job drilling_holes in concrete fence posts which my previous hammer_drill waved the white flag at !.
negative	ordering a laptop , i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery window .
negative	receipts , reservation numbers , actual tickets , probably some shakin ' steven '_s concert_tickets in there as well .
neutral	unfortunately , the main disappointment was the fixings for the blind .
negative	i will never fly with them again - i would rather walk !
negative	!
negative	0nd experience i had with them was when i ordered something from zaggora - ordered some expensive clothing which i really wanted to arrive quickly .
neutral	i have recently_purchased rosehip_tablets and was very disappointed to only receive one bottle whereas i have always had the bogof_offer .
positive	i googled mazuma and followed the instructions on the website , very good instructions for locating the imei_number .
negative	i ordered a bouquet for my only sister at christmas time and only good thing i can say about it is that it arrived when requested .
neutral	i '_ve seen plenty of cases where someone has tried to correct an english exercise but the correction was riddled with errors .
neutral	i was frustrated that the jigraphy title on the puzzle wasn_'_t on the top as in the picture on the box but at the side .
negative	about half an_hour later i received another call from this company ( a different person ); a similar conversation ensued .
negative	however a week_later , on 00 november i received another note from the royal_mail informing_me that another parcel was waiting for me in the depot .
neutral	vacuum tight packaging causes the cushion to shrink and leaving unsightly permanent fold marks ( especially in prime areas of photos ) which unfortunately reduces its quality .
positive	very pleased with this company .
negative	00th_april_0000 i replied to their ' ticket ' again , explaining that none of my questions had been answere , asking them again and i also said that as a good will gesture on their part i was expecting the watch to be sent next_day delivery without extra_cost tome .
neutral	prices are competitive , product range looks good , communication is competent , but delivery fails an otherwise good service .
neutral	not so happy as i really needed them the previous day .
neutral	this module was replaced promptly

positive	super - fast delivery , item packed very well , i will definitely come_back again .
neutral	in the end a very helpful young_man did sort the problem out and i received my order a week late to hand out the t - shirts but in time for the actual event , and his intervention was much_appreciated .
negative	no replys to emails and very unhelpful on the phone .
neutral	the delivery cost at £_00 . 00 was high and so i expected the product to be delivered on the date stated ( next_day delivery , date given was saturday ).
positive	will be my first point of call for future needs .
neutral	i ordered some garden shoes .
neutral	not sure yet whether or not this was a wise purchase !

neutral	as a result , i am raising my score of parcelhero to 0 points .
positive	i would absolutely recommend these_guys to a friend .
neutral	i asked them to call me which they did .
negative	it was worded on my order like an advert , nowhwere did it say i was subscribing to anything and i did not agree to them taking any money other than the items i bought .
negative	assured that the engineer didn_'_t knock my door as he " just had to connect the phone line ".
neutral	i nearly sent them back .
negative	autorenew takes money from your account every year without them sending an invoice as they claim - avoid this company at all costs - google easyspace payment scam for hundreds of other_peoples experiences - also check out easyspace complaints on facebook

positive	it '_s a perfect_fit with good support , would buy others in different_colours if possible .
negative	in my opinion , they are trying to extort money from companies in order for them to be able to give you a right to reply - that '_s not democratic or fair in any way .

positive	from our email , to receiving the posting_pack and receiving payment all happened within one week .

neutral	the goods i have purchased were not as good as i thought they looked .
neutral	i '_m new to electronic train bookings and would prefer to have timetables visible so that i could choose start times for my various journeys with confidence .
negative	despite having my contact number and the recipient '_s contact number , no one was called about the failed delivery .
negative	don_'_t use this service , id recommend look at other bots .
neutral	it could have used a little more flavour , i added quite a lot of salt to make it taste better .

positive	many_thanks !
positive	beautifully_packaged !
positive	thank_you for your very good service .
negative	they say that their products have a 0 year_warranty but try and claim on it - best if luck .
negative	do i believe the coincidence of someone biuying the same part a nano second before me ?
neutral	all a bit of an effort at a busy time of year , and costly in petrol , too
positive	i '_ll be shopping here again for sure
negative	almost_impossible to speak to customer service via your mobile
negative	guess_what ?
negative	the one with attitude ) only started apologising once i told him i want to make a complaint about him .
negative	and we stayed in all day waiting for the order which we had been told to expect on 0 separate_occasions !
neutral	requested the flowers be delivered on a saturday for a birthday surprise for the them to be delivered on the following_monday .
neutral	im sailing every week from wednesday outbound to friday inbound
negative	this was a modern way of riping off people !
positive	no actual layout from your bank !
negative	you published that fact that the comment was removed for being offensive and coarse , did not republish the edited version and have my name on the forum still as being coarse .
neutral	i think that the parts should be aligned before the backing tape is removed and then the application could be trouble_free .
positive	had a wide_range of products , i also love the fact that i can simply reserve my item and get a unique reserve code to pick_up the item in store
negative	no , no , no .
negative	a few_days_later i discovered that the price i was paying was actually billed in pounds , not euros .
neutral	this is no_longer fun and i '_ve lost money with the tiler not able to tiles the worktop walls .
positive	i was really impressed and will definetly order from them again .
negative	they hadn_'_t arrived by the00th so a rang up .

neutral	the serenata bouquet was lovely , and my mother delighted - when she eventually got it .
neutral	initially , the online order firm didnt work .
positive	i experienced a satisfactory product and service
neutral	everything considered it is a solid middle of the road product offered by an american it company .
positive	this is a great opportunity .
negative	i very very rarely have anything to complain_about but have to warn_people before using approved , i started off as an_avid fan , filling my cupboards for incredibly low costs .
positive	i had reservations_about using this service and expected to recieve less_than the advertised price .
neutral	to add to my review , i '_ve just received my cooker at the time specified and by the most helpful driver you could want .
negative	and don_'_t get me wrong , i do not think that all bouquets are delivered like this .
neutral	however , i had no interest in the property for the first week or two , so i then purchased the £_00 . 00 upgrade to include advertising on rightmove and unlimited credit_checks and referencing checks for 0 years .
positive	the delivery was fast , the items good quality , and website / transaction smooth and simple !
neutral	however the time taken in initially completing the paperwork was long_winded , although the staff were pleasant .

negative	i said i therefore wished to cancel order and received email cancelling so i ordered with another company who processed payment without a problem and delivered order .
neutral	any fuel left is then charged to the next customer even_though i paid for it .
neutral	i was severely disappointed , as i '_ve_used eflorist before and had no_problems what so ever .
positive	delivered very quickly and called to confirm beforehand .
positive	have previously purchased two of these planters elsewhere and both arrived with missing_parts , but from shedstore everyting was as it should be .
positive	i immediately ordered the pair and was informed that i would get a free pair .
negative	i will never use hotelopia again .
neutral	i would have expected all the flowers to last at_least 0 days before looking past their best .
positive	they are reliable and easy to use and good value for money .
negative	in the last two years i have purchased a long wool cardigan and a polo neck jumper .
negative	used online_chat - requested photo of item ( to check item not damaged ) understandable .
negative	regards
neutral	despite the problems , i would buy from this company again .
positive	thanks .
positive	great product range and second to none customer_care .
positive	i will_definately make more purchases .
positive	i worked with johnny over the net from half way around the world and he was fantastic in helping_me , replying at all time to suit the time difference we had .
neutral	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn_'_t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).
positive	what more can i ask ?
neutral	now contacted their customer_services by their emailed ' ticket ' system and await their response to wether the meat is indeed consumable still as it is right at the limit of the 00_hours and all the packing had melted .
neutral	positives_: the food .
neutral	tried again and the exact_same problem still_waiting for it to allow to collect it .
neutral	unfortunately , as i took them off , i noticed that the zip on one of the boots had split_open .
negative	just to update you all these_clowns have just refunded me in full
neutral	was very happy with items although purchased two items had to pay 000 for next_day delivery for both items but arrived in one package ( disappointed ) did not offer one delivery charge back .
neutral	they are fabulous - look great , comfortable , light_weight and exectkly the right size ( thanks to the measuring instructions ).

positive	.
neutral	too early to say . sorry .
positive	i recommend them and i will use them again .
neutral	if their tracking was reliable .
positive	nice to have done business with you .
negative	another concern is credible reports of fake_reviews - just google ' fake_reviews wae +' for more info .
negative	got a call on the day they were supposed to arrive to say the refrigerated items did not get loaded_onto the van and that they would be delivered the following_day .
negative	recipient had no clue who it was from as you left the card out !!!!!
neutral	contacted_iflorist via website to ascertain whether delivery had been made .
negative	i have complained but no reply .
neutral	i would seriously have to consider whether i would use dfds again .
positive	thanks a lot !
positive	0_days waiting .
positive	received text_messages to say what was happening to my order .
positive	really good experience from the website to delivery .
positive	smooth and although i thought it might be a bit fraught because we were meeting the guy up on one of the floors of the short_stay parking_bays , he was there on time and we felt he was very trustworthy .
positive	webtogs is a great discovery .
positive	great products along with great customer service .
neutral	unfortunately , the item i ordered appeared quite different ( colour - wise ) to online pic , so i had to return ( and pay returns charge )
negative	all i want at this point is a refund .
negative	they printed ok for a day before becoming patchy and not printing properly .
neutral	the tyres had not arrived in time for them to be fitted at the allocated time and i was told by the fitting_centre that as soon as they arrived they would phone me .
neutral	i think that they need to change delivery service .
neutral	she explained that you have to pull a drop down_menu to get this , but when you have only just started_using the computer you don_'_t always see these things .
positive	recommended by a friend , wasnt_sure about buying in ' outlet ' shop but have been positively_surprised how quickly my order been processed .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	i have asked them over the last 0_weeks for written confirmation that i cancelled and just get the same old standard reply_saying my tickets are non_refundable .
positive	the memory card was exactly_what i required for my camera and it was delivered very quickly .
positive	i would buy from strings_direct everytime as the service is fantastic and the quality is superb and the best thing is that they are value for money
negative	it would '_ve been nice to be told that the hoses were from 0000 inventory .
negative	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
positive	i was very dubious at first of such sites , however after doing a bit of net research found that mazuma was one of the best so decided to give it a go .
positive	but your staff where brilliant .
negative	toilet_pan cracked up back corner .
positive	?
negative	then received a text_message and an e_- mail from xdp today too to say that the eta for the delivery was between 0 . 00pm and 0 . 00pm : delivery or no delivery ?
neutral	great service , speedy delivery and free_returns advertised on site but when opening package you read delivery note to find out that if you do want to return the item the packaging has to be undamaged and the labels still attached , the label thing is fair because you should try things on with them still attached but the packaging . who opens that carefully and i '_m_sure if they really wanted to they could re - attach the label with those small plastic things and they could replace damaged packaging . ho hum no free_returns for me .
neutral	very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england !
negative	in less_than 00_hours many of the flowers had died although it had been kept in perfect conditions . i emailed iflorist twice . no answer . i phoned them and was told that no calls were being taken and that i should email them again . which i did . no answer . i tried to live_chat with them . no answer .
positive	she said they were very fresh and was thrilled to receive them .
negative	she agreed it was unacceptable , she had the written order confirmation confirming the collection date in her hand .
negative	almost unwatchable .
neutral	good service , good price apart_from outrageous £ 0 . 00 charge for credit_card use .
negative	hence i arranged that both parcels be delivered together .
neutral	delivered on time but with no message so my
negative	they should only sell stuff that really is in stock half of it isn . t .
positive	i changed to simplysupplements last_year to enable me to continue taking the pills
neutral	service and delivery were very good but regretfully ink_cartridge supplied for dell 000 printer was rejected by printer and did not work , therefore making it expensive .
neutral	later that night i received an e_- mail apologising saying the parcel will be sent out and will be with me in another 0 days .
neutral	collection of the parcel was also easy and efficient , the driver was on time and was friendly .
neutral	the job was done efficiently and professionally .
negative	at this point i had had enough and intervened saying something like " whoa we are tired from travelling and don_'_t need to treated_like this when all we have done is try to pay for our food ."
neutral	i would_gladly pay more for a smaller coach and a speedier transfer as this is just getting too long .
negative	we received an email in the morning saying our item was out for delivery that day , and on checking the tracking it was showing it as on the van out for delivery .
neutral	good is you can grab a great bargain
negative	i have since emailed wowcher asking for my money back as my order was placed & paid for in good faith , they have credited my account with a wowcher credit which is not what i want !!!
negative	on arrival they had no idea we were coming and had no car available , so we had to drive back in a faulty ( and potentially_dangerous ) car , wasting time and fuel .
positive	always helpful and quick to respond .
positive	hi
negative	i telephoned the contact number indicated on the evans_halshaw documentation : and spoke to the aftersales leader .
neutral	my order simply hasn_'_t turned_up , it '_s stuck in a logistics system somewhere .
neutral	when i asked about them she was reluctant to say but after some persuasion said they were not that impressive but it was a lovely thought .
negative	this was before i had even left t - mobile !
positive	and the turnaround on my order was very quick .
negative	i '_m glad i stayed strong , yet i fear they will try this stunt with other people !
neutral	one of the main_reasons for me to send my children to camp beaumont is for them to make new friends .
neutral	tyre_fitter was very good , polite and professional .
positive	would use them again simple process and good value
neutral	to be fair they cancelled the delivery charge but better follow_up when goods not in stock would lead to better confidence in using again .
neutral	getting the item is as important as a good website , shopping etc experience - so to wait in all day for the delivery only to have city_link not bothered if they deliver your stuff or not has ruined this shopping_experience .
positive	physio_supplies provided an excellent service .
positive	so easy !
positive	with a range of different frames and whatever size you want , with a range of mounts , it was really simple .
neutral	not really good enough .
positive	quickly delivered and any_queries there staff are happy to help .
neutral	the flowers arrived on the monday and i '_m told they were lovely .
negative	i ordered a bouquet of vibrant roses to be sent to my mother - in - law for mother '_s day .
negative	after the sales rap i told them that i would not be entering into any agreement until the end of the two_weeks so i can see if the google site had any benefits .
positive	another problem free purchase .
negative	paid_extra money for express delivery but wasn_'_t delivered - said was no one to sign at 0pm despite it being a business that '_s open until_0pm will 0 people on site to sign .
negative	i waited in all day ( 0am until 0 :_00pm and someone the rest of the night in case they decided to show up ) and no parcel , only to check the tracking at 00 :_00pm that they ' attempted delivery ' at 0 :_00pm and no - one was there so they left a card for re - delivery .
negative	!
positive	the assistant tried to find it on the internet , without luck so , i went home , found all . beauty . com on the net and bought the large bottle at a fraction of the original price
positive	exellent service at a great price , this was my first time using serenate_flowers having previously used other high_street brands with disappointing results and delivery , however i am now a convert to serenate_flowers and fill certainly be using them again .
neutral	my brother in law came home at 00 . 00_pm and discovered them on the front step .
neutral	they gave_me the wrong info and the result was i had to pay for the mot because i hadn_'_t booked it online .
positive	merlin had a great deal on .
positive	very pleased with my purchase from animed , very quick delivery & very good price
negative	unfortunately , only 0 arrived the next_day .
positive	this is the third time i have used etyres . they appealed to me as it is so convenient having them come to your home at no extra_cost and at a time that suits you , the fitters have all been very courteous and friendly .
positive	good products and fast delivery .
neutral	selection was a good price on an offer but not sure i would be happy to pay full price .
negative	my dealings with mobilecashmate came as a shock as i had never known such appalling methods to steal from people .
neutral	the flowers were delivered and i believe the quality to have been satisfactory for the price however i doubt that i will use this service again .
negative	unfortunately that would have just left her with a collection of stems … making idiots out of their customers .
neutral	( i would use webtogs much more regularly if a reasonable postage rate applied ).
neutral	after a couple of weeks with no communication from the company , i sent an e_- mail asking if they could advise as to when i could expect delivery of my order .
positive	don_'_t bother with the rest , stick with the best .
neutral	i called and they checked on the status of my order .
negative	the second time misguided never gave the correct_address , missing out the building name and my parcel never arrived on the next_day delivery , after this i was told there was nothing they could do and had to wait_until monday for it to be delivered at which point was too late .
neutral	this is nonsense and i would not have ordered it from wex if i could have found the item with another supplier .
neutral	this item arrived damaged , unfortunately , by the time we spotted it we were at the point of ' no return ' and now will have to live with it .
negative	united_kingdom

positive	very good iteam and also very quick at sending it out revived it before the estimated_date : would recommend to people and i would use them again .
positive	delivery time given 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 delivered on time could not ask for more .
neutral	could aim for same day delivery if ordered
negative	a week_later , no response , so i resent it and asked if they ' d received it .
negative	i had the misfortune of dealing_with this company after buying a groupon_voucher for some banksy prints back in march .

positive	the financial_advisor was efficient , but listened well to gain information needed to produce a suitable plan for my present circumstances .
neutral	i was having_difficulty opting for delivery at the checkout so tried the online_chat_facility .
neutral	i booked through the gosimply website as it gave a good comparison of options and produced the lowest_price from a reputable provider .
negative	i think you can guess who im going back to when im out of contract , and i will also be going to the small_claims court when that happens to get my money back .
positive	downsides - only one really - a rather incestuous relationship with petrolhead nirvana .
negative	i provided my paypal_account and a mobile_phone .

neutral	this is now where talktalk starts to become a problem i had to call them repeatedly to resolve the issue as i twigged by asking in my flats as we live in a block of 00 it was a new person_who had recently_moved in , the openreach engineer had managed to swap our lines in the junction_box outside our flats , but try telling that to some one in manilla they basically couldnt digest the issue and also the same time i was waiting for a brightspark to install my youview never showed up , so by monday after ringing customer retentions kicking off demanding to end my contract again fobbed_off saying it takes 0 to 0 days for a manager to deal with a complaint , still stuck with someone_elses phone n bb service and they have mine , basically talktalk blaming open_reach so i finally get a call off open_reach this rude guy , when i told_him the issue he was saying thats not my job you need a home visit im an exchange engineer ring you provider and make an appointment , so im ready to tear my hair out not , so i finally rang talktalks head_office left my issue and complaints , then i get a guy call me to say he is from the dheif executives office and he is personally dealing_with my account , finally we got to the bottom of it , yes it was open reaches fault not directly talktalks but the issue is talktalk and openreach have a very poor communication system as the bt guy when he come to my house explained , the work blind with just a job number and no line or work info theese errors especially buildings with multipul lines going into the building sometimes the cant figure_out whos is whos because they just dont_know unless the number is given on the job sheet talktalk dont due to customer privacy but a huge ball ache for the engineer , after 00 days i was back up and running with my own service and i negotiated 0 months free service as a £_00 credit , so if you have any major issues ring talktalks head_office and ask to speak to the cheif executives office they are the powers who be , but on that note i am happy with what i have and when my sister moved_house and told her to get talktalk for the prices and deals shes never had an issue her self apart

positive	some have even bought frames that did not suit me but suited them /
negative	i could have bought something very similar for a fraction of the price .
neutral	i ordered this for my granddaughter and her partner who had just lost a baby . for the price i expected more than 0a0 pages , one of whichwas laminated . a fair bit of detail but i was expecting more .
neutral	a few minor_issues i know but at £ 0 , 000 . 00 you would expect it to be spot on !
neutral	my first order with them just never arrived and the blame was passed on to the delivery company , having to wait 0_weeks for them to file a compensation claim before being sent a replacement .
positive	their customer service is first - class .
negative	when were they going to let_me know this , if i hadn_'_t contacted them ?
negative	horrible technical_support , coverage impossible where i live now , no internet_connection but data was being comsumed somehow .
positive	i will_definately use the company again when i run_out of supplies and look_forward to an ever widening range of natural products .
neutral	it worked well , the driver was very late on the day but otherwise reliable and saved us a lot of money from hiring a van and doing it ourselves .
positive	my friend received her flowers yesterday .

negative	after waiting for 0_days for my order to be shipped ( my chemical romance , black parade poster ) they sent me a giant sunflower poster , which has nothing to do with my chemical romance .
neutral	he was happy to help including letting_me know how far away i was travelling .
neutral	i nearly just walked_away from the order when i went round and round a few_times .
negative	i '_m dubious because in my entire life nothing i have ever sent by post has not arrived .
positive	it has many choices for all different requests to suit all types of personal needs .
negative	rang customer service who said they can '_t help or reinstate offer .
neutral	i purchased some remanufactured ink_cartridges , big mistake , had to send them all back ( freepost_address so no cost to return the faulty cartriges ) was given a credit_note but i wanted a refund , when i phoned customer_services they said the refund could take up to 00 days , even_though i paid by paypal so refunds should be automatic , it shouldn_'_t take so long to long to do a simple refund .

positive	if you was lookin for ski_equipment take a look at their website as i have always had good service from them .
negative	not only is an amount charged double but also the wrong amount ( higher ).
neutral	the boxes themselves are made from very thin_cardboard and in my opinion should have had some added_protection before being sent in courier bags .
neutral	firstly the measurements weren_'_t quite right for the trellis component , which was 0mm or so too_narrow to fit the posts to either side .
neutral	no effort at all to try and deliver and just because i live in a road of flats they choose not to deliver to my flat !
positive	so simple yet so difficult for many online_retailers .
neutral	these jeggings are nice and stretchy not bad quality for the money but they are just too short and will be or anyone over 0 ' 0 " ok if younwanbo tuck into boots but not if you want to wear with heels or flats as they are literally halfway up my ankle .

positive	perfect price , service and delivery , what more can i ask ?
negative	i am very disappointed !
positive	instead of searching diy_stores to try to locate the tiny battery for my garage remote_control i turned to buyabattery .
positive	great communication and very efficient service .
negative	strange really as the royal_mail manage , amazon manage and so does most other_companies .
negative	it is all very well advertising great prices but if you have to wait ages to be told its out of stock and then wait even longer for a refund then any discount is not cost_effective for the purchaser .
neutral	i bought a dell_laptop as i '_d had good experiences with dell in the workplace .
negative	00 hour delivery arrives more 00 later .
neutral	i '_ve asked for innumerable refunds and they do that quickly and obligingly , but the packing never improves .

neutral	i was not able to track my order as no tracking code sent and the track my order link just sends you to the home page .
positive	fashioneyewear dealt promptly and professionally with my order , including handy updates on progress .
positive	right equipment .
negative	however goods aren_'_t in stock and delivery is approx 0 to 00 weeks - a good job my holiday wasn_'_t immediate .
positive	they also gave thorough descriptions and a floor plan .
negative	today '_s excuse is that they have been unable to fulfil my order due to demand .
negative	we have four children , three of whom are on the autistic spectrum , not only is holiday time precious for them to spend time with their dad , but i also need his time to help me when they are at home ?!

negative	thanks sam
neutral	companies shouldn_'_t promise if they can '_t deliver .
negative	the following_day i rang again and no such refund had been processed .
neutral	i checked my phone for value .
neutral	the only_slight_criticism i have is that they were delivered about 0_days after i ordered them the web_site guarantees 0_days .
neutral	pre_- pay online , so no_faffing_about with payments etc .
negative	i have read a few reviews online were people have had the same problem and have stated this is due to o the perfume being old and off .
neutral	will i use a postal service again probably not although the rates are much_better but that was too close to not getting my cash .
neutral	very difficult to speak to anyone after purchase .
negative	i said this simply was not good enough as i was now having to pay an extra £_00 because of their incompetence .
neutral	they also have free_returns and other select accessories which makes it such a great place to shop from .

neutral	no visit from the rep , 0st time in 0 we '' ve not been visited to make_sure all was ok , call me cynical but i can see why !
positive	if you can do better_than this i ' d love to hear about it
neutral	i would have give 0_stars otherwise .
positive	excellent value for money and a speedy delivery to a local collection_point .
neutral	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something_else now i understand that they do run_out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic .
neutral	display_case is really well made .

neutral	great , so pleased with service i emailed them to compliment them !
positive	i was kept completely up to date as to where the flowers where in the delivery process .
positive	the icing_on the cake was the price was the best one i could_find after extensive_searching .
negative	phone_calls went_unanswered , was told not to leave a message but email and they would respond within 00_hours .
negative	by this time , tests and assessments of your service will be performed outside of peak hours and an email will follow asking for you to provide more information as they ‘ cannot see a problem from their end ’.
positive	the service was the reason i went for the diamond_factory and i wasnt disappointed .
neutral	i ordered the cloud_nine rollers , one was faulty .
positive	collected on time .
negative	i ordered item and paid for it on 00 . 0 . 00 delivery 0 - 0_days .
negative	we phoned them on two occasions to clarify whether we were allowed to check in luggage on our flight and whether it was included in the cost of our flight .
negative	it turns_out the courier service was to blame and their courier didnt even seem to know where he had delivered it !
neutral	there was not enough seating for all the customers so people we ' re standing around in the road .
negative	have phoned twice , emailed 0 times and still they have not refunded by payment 0_days_later .
neutral	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
negative	this is a terrible service and i won_'_t be using tripsta again .
positive	i took it and was off , before the lpool rush hour traffic !
positive	great shoes - very comfortable and a good price .
positive	the area can be a minefield but he did all the research and found the right deal for me and my circumstances .
positive	communications were excellent , even with an_email letting_me know the hour_slot that the parcel would be delivered .
positive	they also have a great website that has manuals and instructional_videos
neutral	to conclude . i bought my " ticket " onto rightmove through them .
negative	on friday i received a letter saying they had tried and failed to contact me by phone and email ( yet i had had no emails from them , no missed calls .) and that there was a problem and could i call them .
negative	0_days_later was the earliest delivery .
positive	they were a great price , and i even got a discount_code for them .
positive	i bought a jumper from the john_anthony website ( which was easy to use ).
neutral	most of this type are quite expensive but tons of tiles was the best value for money .
neutral	when they did this they discovered a fault with the brakes (!
neutral	i was disappointed that it took them a week to email me to say they had now processed my order and it was ready for collection from the courier .
neutral	so this leads me to believe either their checking process is not thorough or they claim the odd item missing to get a bit of extra money for themselves .
neutral	if this had not happened i would have rated higher
negative	we now no_longer order from merchants who use city_link .
neutral	train your staff !
negative	i booked us on a half board rate where dinner was served in a street restaurant and not within the hotel .
negative	it is solely based on personal opinion and is written completely unbiased .
negative	i mean what company in this day and age waits till the customer calls with a tracking_number before they start to process a refund ?
positive	i '_ve_used shopto many_times , and everytime the quality of service has_been superb .
negative	so , after ignoring my other emails in which i mentioned taking_legal_action , i have replied to this latest email from conrad at webuy . com by reitterating this line of action wil proceed as of 0 . 00am tommorow 00th of march if the situation is unresolved by 0 . 00pm today .
neutral	i would have liked thicker cardboard .
negative	order placed nearly a week_ago it '_s xmas_eve at 0pm and no delivery for my nephew ??
negative	the wait on just processing alone should have been the wait time for processing and shipping for $_00 dollar shipping charge . that is outrageous !
positive	good value and it only needs turning_up slightly .
neutral	i spent about 00_minutes setting it up on the phone , but the first order got lost so luckily i called back the next_day to check .
positive	great product .
neutral	liberty bathrooms however did not forget to take my money promptly .
neutral	animed_direct have pretty fair prices however their service was spoilt on 0 counts .
neutral	with all the extra costs it ended_up being so much more .
neutral	finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided , i contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act_together .
positive	perfect service .
negative	oh and i am not even with talktalk .
negative	awful service with last_minute . com .
neutral	despite having sufficient funds in my fairfx account , my payment was twice refused , forcing_me to pay extra for booking with a debit_card .
negative	you are rubbish rubbish rubbish bunch of theives who ruin people '_s credit and give absolutely nothing for loyalty to you .
negative	so can '_t deliver .
positive	i hadn_'_t used them before but found them to be good value and very efficient .
neutral	special delivery arranged and order delivered just in time .
negative	over a week_later i arranged another return when my top hadn_'_t been collected .
negative	so i tried_calling their customer service and after getting past the automated stuff i waited on hold for 00_minutes .

positive	the price was right and i received my shower_head the very next_day .
positive	this is the second time ive hired a car with this company and found the staff very helpful and service has always been fast and efficen , will be sticking with them on my next visit to tenerife !
negative	the second time i tried to order something i was told that my email address & password didn_'_t exist so i set_up another account .
negative	00_minutes later i had a phone_call saying no sorry its not coming with highway couriers its coming with torr distributions and they gave_me the number to call to get an_eta .
neutral	bill reference rosendal : 00 / 0000000 .
positive	what more can one ask of a firm ?
neutral	good cs would have not resulted_in this outcome , they didn_'_t seem to want to help me when it came to billing .
neutral	0 roses - 0 was completely wilted .

positive	the door_knobs that i ordered are of excellent quality and were delivered promptly with plenty of communication from shower_seal to let_me know when to expect them . brilliant .
negative	unfortunately , on this occasion , it is the latter .
neutral	the whole_process from tracking to payment is too slow and too fussy .
negative	the rest of order and replacements items were sorted_out in the nick of time and promised next_day . items delivered seemed okay except one item missing - nothing important just the shower_cubicle
neutral	ordered a pasta_maker baking , pans and small glass teapot .
positive	i immediately explained the situation with customer_services and after sending a photo to show the damage_caused i was sent a replacement within_00hours !
neutral	always on time and delviery people always very fiendly and helpful .
negative	i have tried_calling waeplus but there is never anyone on the phonelines and all my emails are met with silence .
neutral	following resolution of this problem , the results have been much more predictable .
neutral	i found customer_services were quite unhelpful when experiencing problems tethering on my iphone
negative	my anniversary was over by the time they arrived
neutral	!. no comms whatsoever , items take about 0_weeks then one item from order was was then put back upto another 0_weeks ( 0_weeks in total !!
neutral	great service and quick delivery , though was not told that order was dispatched and order was not tracked so didn_'_t know when it would arrive .

neutral	the strap itself is genuine leather and high_gloss , high_quality .
negative	would recomend this company for quality of products will use them again
neutral	great price with it being second_hand and next_day delivery was great ; however the pictures did not show any wear to the top of the headstock , and i can only surmise this came from the woeful packing of the instrument which had been crammed_into a standard guitar box with no case and had the lid taped shut around it .
positive	the price was massively_discounted and we would definately not have been able afford this range of quality worktops at a local_store .
neutral	ineeded to know something about the booking i made with lowcost yesterday , so phoned the 0000 no re existing booking to be promptly informed that no agents were available and it would cost me 00p_per_minute to wait !

neutral	ok experience .
negative	this was from one of their franchise delivery personal who turned_up in a rough looking people carrier and had no form of uniform , clearly he doesn_'_t take care of the items in his possession and as the same man who picked_up the pc tower i wouldn_'_t be surprised if he was the one who dented the case .
positive	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos_card has_been sent out . im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company . and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
neutral	i ordered my pc on 0th_january_0000 via the website and it arrived on 00 january_0000 so just outside the 0 week lead time mentioned on their website so not too bad , it came with all the correct components , the oem windows 0 disk and the graphics_card box + drivers so no_problems there !

positive	excellent service
neutral	it was lucky that we hadn_'_t had rain , or a rubbish collection that day .

neutral	hence with booking individual services you can not get times together .
negative	the item concerned is still showing as in stock despite my complaint and the response to my complaint on the length of time it has taken for customer service to address my concerns was " as you are aware our offices were closed from friday the 00st of december for christmas and reopened today , this is the reason your emails were no responded to earlier " how i was supposed to have known that they decided to close the office 0 days before_christmas , this was not mentioned in any correspondence to me .

positive	i even got an email_telling_me my parcel had been delivered , with the name of who had signed for it the charge was cheaper_than the post_office and the parcel size caused no problem whereas it was too long for the post_office and would have to go by parcel_force ( this caused cold shivers to run up and down my spine ).
negative	i get a sense that these individuals are very god at the sales_pitch and making money off people at the start but less good at after - care and facing up to responsibilities when things go_wrong .

negative	do not use them - put your business elsewhere !
negative	a disgusting ' service ', even the £_00 off won_'_t make me return ( unless they sort their staff out ).
negative	i did ask customer " services " if there was anything that could be done to expedite a properly built pair but my impression was that they couldn_'_t care less .
negative	we were left high and dry and ended_up an_hour of messing_about having to sort our own transport out which funnily_enough was cheaper_than what resorthoppa was charging for the same service .
negative	and then enjoy it .
negative	i just could get it in the post_office 0_days after my shop on line .
positive	got great avon_tyres for the price of budget tyres from another supplier !
positive	i sent them to my sister in law for her 00 th_birthday , she says they are beautiful and was very thrilled with them .
negative	i tried to call customer_services twice as i hadn_'_t heard back via_email , both_times i have been put onto hold for around 00_minutes .
negative	then it was canned altogether .
positive	will be getting more gear next year .
negative	never use this bunch of rogues .
negative	no way .
neutral	rather friustrated that the email advertised discounts didn_'_t flow through when attempted to use on ipad .
negative	i can only_assume that all parcel0go staff work from home so can wait in for several days in the hope that a courier might turn_up , most of us can '_t .
positive	the quality of the product is excellent . considerably better quality than b_& q and homebase , and way better quality than wickes
positive	i particularly_like being_able to view the menus and decide what to order before the takeaway is open .
positive	i did opt to send the more_expensive item by special delivery because the information did say they cant accept_responsibility items not received or damaged in transit , and this cost about a fiver .
negative	. that they also try not to pay .
negative	make_sure you read the delivery rules .
positive	easy to use site , loads of products at competitive_prices , goods were very well_packaged and delivery was fast .
positive	excellent speedy service delivered on time and to the correct office not easy in a large hospital .
neutral	so on the attention to detail side - i am not personally a fan but product quite satisfactory .
negative	i ordered an offside front sun_visor for a maxus van , costing_£_00 . 00 .
negative	0th_jan , as yet i have still not received any response to my complaint .
positive	just in case i will_continue to monitor the level .
negative	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
negative	again , we put our postcode in and it said then ' we can deliver to you on the 00th_june '.
positive	fantastic all_round .
negative	be careful - although the items may be in the sale they may not be 0000 saleable .
negative	the company took my money , failed to provide the item at the advertised price , and to date has failed to refund me .
negative	a huge disappointment and inconvenience for me and the 0 friends and work_colleagues i had invited to the concert .
negative	i was told of the process of late entry .
negative	still no refund recieved .
negative	i telephoned the online number and was told i would receive a telephone_call within 00_mins re the situation .
negative	all they said was there was no contact from yodel ( who were waiting for a call from interparcel ) but refused to ring them .
neutral	no money was taken no order dispatched .
neutral	things went badly wrong from there on .
positive	so after 0 minutes on the kwik - fit website i ' d bought the tyres and arranged for the fitting in 0 days time , i got a phone_call from a customer_services lady_who confirmed my details and it was all done .
positive	the boots looks good and are easy to adjust when you have a footer about with them . and the added_bonus of free socks as well , we all love a freebie :_d
positive	!
neutral	the powder did not dissolve in water and was quite potent as it burns the throat whilst drinking ( actually like drinking glass splinters !!)
neutral	the order address and date , which were vitally_important as the order was being sent internationally was also messed_up and i had to complain yet again .
negative	as i live in california it was impossible to make other arrangements for flower delivery that day .
positive	rob bass
positive	when calling i was answered quickly and the staff were very helpful .
neutral	with alot of um , and uhh conversation wasnt impressed
positive	i also made a rich chocolate buttercream - the chocolate created a light full flavoured frosting that piped perfectly .
positive	so quick !
negative	i won_'_t be using them , or any company that only uses their services again .
negative	received a phone_call on tuesday , telling_me one item was discontinued but they did have the 000 pack available which i didn_'_t want , so cancelled the whole_thing .
neutral	i also asked a question using online_chat which was quickly answered .
negative	not out for delivery as expected ?
negative	as an ex courier when a customer hands me an item , i and the company are then responsible for that item and it is then covered by the courier insurance liability .
positive	delivery was fast .
negative	rubbish service rubbish company keep well away from them !
positive	if you like any of the materials on the website blinds_0go will happily send you out a sample .
neutral	in garage , but failing that what you save in price you lose on having it fitted .
negative	still no delivery date .
neutral	with multivits you have to ' know '!
neutral	the wellies themselves were not damaged , but if i had bought them for a gift i would not have been happy with the state of the box !
negative	have never ever known a company like ebay who circumnavigate uk law by basing their admin in dublin & finances in luxemborg by doing this they avoid the monopolies commission so they have a almost total domination of the uk auction market so they just basically do whatever they want as they realistically know you have nowhere_else to go the goverment need to stop ebay asap !
negative	and despite confirming on the day , the driver did not come to pick_up .
negative	although the dispute is still open and the company keeps contacting me for return of the clubs .
neutral	i found the site easy to use and access the best rate of mexican peso '_s .
neutral	customer service can be friendly and helpful at times , but in the last few_months has tended to be abrupt and unwelcoming .
positive	great site , easy to use and incredibly quick delivery .
neutral	also the water does not cut_off unless the whole item is placed on an extremely flat base - not always easy in a chicken run !
negative	we had disposed of our old desk because delivery had been confirmed .
neutral	you can '_t do anything .
positive	coming from university i feel the pace and responsibility to complete the assignments at my own speed give me chance to digest the infomation properly and feel_comfortable in the knowing i can apply my knowledge in the real world .
neutral	otherwise reasonably fair sevice .
negative	they charged me for nitrogen fill in all 0 tyres which wasn_'_t requested or ordered .
neutral	suggest emails from customer are acknowledged .
neutral	so missed out on a 00_% saving .
positive	a very good service with a very good range to make every meal special
neutral	on examination there is a fault wth the alignment of the doors affecting the magnetic_catches which do not meet .
negative	it would be delivered and she estimated . drum roll
positive	delivery is second to none .
neutral	we had already paid on line .
positive	kind_regards
positive	fantastic service , quick , simple and absolutly no_fuss .
positive	would recomend to all our friends .
neutral	well it was good that my flowers turned_up and was ok to send next door . hopefully next time you could let the receiver address know they have flowers next door ? a little note as i sent a message to say have she received my present . she received a day later and the flowers where nice , which is a positive .
negative	trustpilot , yelp , i '_ll post to facebook , i will make everybody i know aware of it .
positive	. fast delivery would recommend
negative	i would rather pay more money then go through all this hassle !!!!!
positive	the order comes quickly .
negative	when we rang them they claimed it was due to not being driven for a while and to give it a full_tank of fuel , suffice to say this didn_'_t work .
negative	who is employed by a delivery company who can '_t get a flipping address correct , now i cant find my very expensive product .
negative	this time the trespassing driver had returned .
positive	to the hour delivery time is just brilliant !
neutral	i got in touch with affordable_supplements to complain and they said that they would get in touch with the delivery company to see what went wrong .
neutral	i tired to fill in my quote online but had difficulty_getting all my medication on there so i decided to call .
negative	no response
neutral	she then arranged for an_alternative bed to be delivered the next_day witout incurring the extra saturday delivery charge .
negative	i said yes .
neutral	unbelievably , the satnav was 00euros a day and the booster_seat 0euros a day .
neutral	this also included unexpected extra costs as we had received new invoices but they were so unclear that we weren_'_t able to follow the changes in the charges .
negative	therefore i would recommend not going near o0 and especially near the derby store unless you happen to be riding a bulldozer .
negative	rude , unhelpful and possibly the worst experience i have ever had with an online company .
negative	the shed is 00 feet by 00 feet , and some panels like the gable with the double doors are extremely heavy .
neutral	still if you don_'_t make any mistakes , you will be cool .
neutral	for their great value and fabulous service
negative	there was no mention in the quote initially received about deducting money for the phone being locked , there is even the option to add who the phone is locked to .
positive	literally , have gone the extra_mile and had a long day , getting to this remote (_ish ) end of the country !
neutral	you should send an_email_confirmation that the parcel has_been collected .
neutral	on the desk they tried to sell several services and upgrades .
neutral	however , the flood of texts and e_- mails about the delivery were just overwhelming ; they were also rather ' unfriendly ' in that i was being told to make_sure that i was in at the agreed time , that the journey from the lorry to the room was totally clear and if i did not comply with all these instructions then there would be penalty charges - it was quite intimidating .
positive	i had ordered the quick step arte laminate_flooring and they were delivered at a good price and the quality was top_class .
negative	add that fact they go missing for a week with no contact , then get various assurances of re delivery to all be dashed when finally the two rudest operatives arrive late on a friday_evening to slag off their job in front of a client then be rude to the client really re defines poor service .
positive	all communication excellent too .
neutral	delayed cash_back nearly 0 months , but they got me the mentioned value , so trust_worthy
negative	when i printed_off my booking it did it is landscape so i only had the top bit of my booking confirmation .
positive	plus they were on special_offer !
negative	i looked for the online_chat but couldn_'_t find it anywhere !
negative	don_'_t go near !
positive	the cateye is excellent .
positive	caroline immediately offered to cancel it and refund my money and very kindly gave_me some other_places that i could_possibly get insurance for someone out of the country .
negative	contact bank .
negative	does anyone know - do they sell your data on ?
positive	would recommend buyspares for a good selection of products , offering good service & a prompt delivery
positive	i would
negative	there phone number is turned on and off and charged at premium_rate so don_'_t call them as they make money from this too .
negative	stating i was unhappy and what did they plan to do about it ?
neutral	however , their delivery service let them down .
neutral	interparcel should drop hermes as soon as possible before it tarnishes their reputation !
negative	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
neutral	it took nearly a year for the cash_back to be paid the first year , much longer_than the tracking statistics would suggest .
neutral	untidy , chaotic and seemingly unsupervised fitters .
negative	has_been 0_weeks and it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
neutral	however , on one occasion , returned an item which surfdome claimed not to have received - very disappointing .
neutral	however , once i did get hold of a person ( via the company twitter ) they were very helpful and gave_me a full_refund .
negative	after many calls to customer_services and threatening to cancel my order , to not very helpful employees , i received my vacuum_cleaner 0_weeks_later !!
positive	just joined recently and already saved £_00
positive	so , i knoew things were about to go wring when i got down to st_albans on the m0 and the traffic was slow as it can get ….
neutral	it feels_like only a matter of time before the lens will pop completely out .
negative	i would never use rentify again or recommend them in any way .
neutral	but you didn_'_t say it was a horrible tast and that my cat wouldn_'_t touch it .
positive	i like the website and shall use it again in the future .
positive	i tried to sell a computer on ebay a while ago using myhermes and it was a total_disaster .
negative	the woman at resorthoppa stated she would speak to the director however i am yet to hear_anything nor have i been refunded - yet .
negative	i had pretty_much worked out what flights and train_journeys we needed to book but thought i ' d just call to check if a discount would be available in recognition of the number of flights involved .
negative	update to this review
positive	:
positive	the actual sign is great quality and looks lovely on our house .
positive	i recommend beautybay as an all_round winner .
negative	i got home from work on tuesday and a collection card been put through my door .
negative	utterly dispiriting service , like the worst of the0000s .
positive	thank_you .
negative	why did it leave the warehouse in that condition ?
negative	then to top it off another parcel from another retailer got the same treatment at the same time .
neutral	i tried to give them a call back to speak to the same person and on 0 occasions they said he was busy and he ' d give me a call back .
neutral	it was also really well_packaged when it was returned .
negative	yodel are useless !
neutral	when we got to pay machine , he said " wait here , i have to pay " the way he said was rather rude .
neutral	ordered shed for my daughter , with her address for delivery , and my address for cardholder .
positive	the product that i purchase was available slightly cheaper on another site , but they did not provide the additional service of fast delivery and for me this was vital as i had a tight_deadline for when i needed my purchase .
neutral	scan are a very good component supplier and at a very good price .
positive	full_marks to you mazuma , good job .
positive	a quick google brought me to gjwtitmuss and in a very short time a large sack arrived at my door which will keep the birds and my wallet happy for a good long time .
positive	excellent company !
positive	simple , efficient service . enough said .
positive	first_class product at the best price
negative	but once they finally realised they were at fault they ' miraculously ' could do something and cancelled the order and offered a refund .
negative	i have been patient with them and put up with lies every time i have had to contact them .
neutral	shame .
negative	very very disappointing when it comes to try and speak to someone .
negative	!
neutral	i bought 0 bunches and spent £_00 so really wasn_'_t happy and feel like i wasted my money
neutral	to cut a long_story_short , after looking online and finding some , i called a different branch of rs who sent me the av_receiver for a very small fee ( under £ 0 ).
negative	both tasted as bad as they looked and we still hadn_'_t had our drinks .
negative	delivery to the following recipient failed permanently :
neutral	i was a bit_confused and questioned it .
positive	a good quality very competitively_priced exterior door , delivered well_packaged , on time and with full communication_throughout .
neutral	i ordered a pair of trousers on the 0th_january , with a delivery time of 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i was looking for a next_day delivery service so searched on google .
neutral	i could even go on ebay and immediately find items for cheaper .
negative	parcel delivered after 0pm ( had to go out at 0pm ) call couriers an they have advised that cannot collect parcel so wanted to charge for redelivery .
neutral	the go_karting was an excellent activity !
positive	very happy indeed and would definitely recommend bride_& groom_direct !
neutral	not !
neutral	took a phone_call and about 0 emails to sort it out - the colour i wanted was , by now , out of stock .
positive	excellent , will definitely use you again .
neutral	to : peter emmerson

positive	tracking predicted time of arrival within a one hour_timeslot - well impressed .
neutral	i then get an email_saying that my order was going to be shipped ( a good week_later ) but although the initial item that was out of stock was now available one of my other items was now out !
positive	bella_barista are always extremely_helpful with any and all queries that we '_ve had with regard to our machines and all orders are always dealt_with quicly and eifficiently .
positive	i had seen a number of isofix car seats on the market and struggled to make a decison .
neutral	at the initial hire stage it states " collision_damage_waiver ", read the details and it , s not quite what you get , when questioning this at the pick_up desk l am told that in the event of an accident the cover only applies to body damage , wheels tyres windows and fittings are not covered which implies it would have to be a unique accident , another catch to wangle more money .
neutral	staff not helpful and looked very confused and flustered ( disorganised ).
negative	i cancelled the contract after a week after orange said they did not know when i ' d receive the phone and i would get my £_00 back within a month .
negative	changed the way i feel about the company plus i have now lost a valuable client because of all this .
negative	we are not happy at all with the service that we have received .
negative	i now envisage a fight getting a prompt refund !!!

neutral	especially with discount_coupons .
positive	will_certainly return , when other tyres are required .
negative	what the heck !
negative	my friend need cheering_up and the message was forgotten , no card and her name was spelt wrongly .
neutral	had to contact the seller twice to explain that they had taken my payment via_paypal but hadn_'_t processed my order .
positive	excellent price , fast delivery , i have bought from here before and will definitely buy from here again .
negative	flowers came with brown patches , flowers looked like they were already dying , set them up for my mum for when she returned home and she asked if i had hidden them in a cupboard for a few day without water !!

positive	speedy delivery smooth_transaction would highly_recommend physioroom . com
negative	bewarr everybody .
neutral	the dishes arrived and they had handles on them .
positive	what a pleasure_dealing_with this company , they were reliable , have a simple ordering system , good communication , speedy delivery and great selection of watches to choose from .
positive	simple .
neutral	i have had to chase my appointments all the time the pboro office closed local to me and i wasnt informed . noone conatcts me regarding after care , and this i wouldnt recomend them
neutral	the pandora order was so slow it was painful confusing and over a month how long does it take to send out an order and they charge 0 . 00 for even small items .
negative	since tiscali was taken over by talk_talk , more_expensive poor products , bad service , non - existant customer service , impossible to contact anyone , slow slow slow connection via broadband , keep selling me extra products that never materialise .
neutral	the customer service was excellent .
negative	p . s i am sure they will respond with their usual excuses as they did with me for 0_months .

neutral	have had some very good experiences with amazon with amazingly fast deliveries , and had some bad .
negative	short_dated produce .
neutral	i had a lot of problems trying to use £ 0 voucher given to me for introducing a friend .
negative	there were 0 staff stood around the checkouts doing bugger all .
neutral	i used to be a fan of ebay , but not anymore . ebay charges you , paypal charges for the same transaction and there is not even an option to pay by check or money order . additionally , i think there are too many cheap and bad quality products from professional sellers that just destroy the whole idea of ebay .
negative	i stupidly didnt read the reviews before i placed an order for 0 x luxury hampers .
negative	i know this company has defrauded me out of £_00 . 00 and will never ever trade with them again .
negative	this cost me £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	having said that , the drivers are always very friendly and helpful so full_marks to them .
positive	i love glasses_direct , they always have some kind of deal on ; they ' re really friendly and helpful when i call up ; they ' re easy to use and they '_ve got a massive_range of glasses .

positive	unlike_other_companies i '_ve_used who take ages and rip you off .
neutral	thank_you waitrose .
negative	never again !
neutral	if i wanted to wait for another attempt at delivery it would be another 0_weeks .
positive	they arrived between there time_slot as stated and the delivery man opened the box with me to check there was scratches etc
positive	this is the only site i visit now .
negative	having finally gotten though to someone , after ten_minutes on hold , all they could do was find out from the florist they had requested the flowers from where they were and then email me back , i felt thoroughly fobbed_off !
positive	this is a quick and reliable card buys website where you can find and buy what you need on a budget
negative	rubbish service from beginning to end .
positive	there are many web - based companies who are happy to shirk any sort of responsibility once they have your money and have carried_out the minimum required of them .
negative	by 00 july we had received no word so my wife phoned customer_services .
negative	buyer_beware . do not use this company for on line purchase . oh they offered me 0 pounds towards my next order . yeah_right .
neutral	i have decided it '_s too much hassle to bother re - ordering .
neutral	it cost him about 00 pounds for the whole trip !
neutral	waited in until_0pm yesterday expecting delivery .
negative	the delivery charge is actually quite reasonable when you realise how much you can get and the choice and quality was very good .
neutral	despite i was told by someone they would pay that price too
positive	impressed with personal service and excellent communication setup - would recommend using this online shopping company as they appear to be reliable and efficient .
negative	this is not the case nor are they interested in their customer_satisfaction .
negative	i did recieve an_email but not confirming my flights it was to say my flights had gone up in price so they would need to cancel .
positive	would definitely recommend sunglasses_shop
positive	definitely stress_free , easy to book , simple instructions , easy drop_off and pick_up , no hanging about

negative	got there okay but when we were going to return to london , we noticed some tickets missing .
negative	find the site cluttered and a clone of msn . and the search_engine is lagging behing google in every sense . useless when you consider msn is run by microsoft , why exist as a multi - million_pound company when your search is behind google , bing and ask and your content is behind msn . yahoo should strike out to make itself more unique .
positive	i found by_chance this company and am very satisfied with their professionalism , friendliness and price
positive	the instructions were clear and concise – 0 hour for two of us to build .
positive	the worktop direct website is excellent and has a lot of choice including accessories .

neutral	ordering from the web_site was v easy .
negative	!
negative	it ’_s time to grow up and understand your customers have a brain and will not always agree with your style , management of practices .
negative	they wil not get custom from me in the future they can keep prices low as their business appears to be making money with other_peoples money , if not why no refund at the earliest_opportunity ??
neutral	i am still_waiting for a response to my email concerning these pegs .
neutral	would suggest that the weight of this package was way over the maximum safe working load .
positive	this site was advertised on my facebook news feed so i clicked to view as me an the other half have recently developed a like for cooking " different " tastes in the kitchen .
negative	they shouldn_'_t be allowed to carry on business .
neutral	top tip ditch the usb and supply better batteries !
positive	called to ask advice and service was great .
neutral	i guess i expected more of leggings costing this much , and i will probably return them even_though i need something for a themed_party this weekend .
neutral	i was then worried for the next 0_days as to whether my flowers would arrive .
negative	you cannot_speak to customer_services as they do not take phone_calls , i was told i had to send an_email which i did and then got a response saying i was 00th in a que .
positive	having had trouble ordering the same product with dell i gave uk digital_cameras a try .
negative	we do now have a working trampoline however the gift did not arrive - i will double_check on the refund - and 0_days after the trampoline had been replaced another box of springs was sent to us which i sent straight back with the carrier !!!!!.
neutral	however i '_m still annoyed from before .
neutral	annoyingly can only enter a single discount_code even if have more .
negative	i took_advantage of this and the tyre was quickly fitted .
neutral	not my best experience and will not be top of my list next time .
neutral	the toyota was far below the quality that we were expecting .
negative	this is an awful experience with vague comments which could mean anything .
negative	in your interest you should arrive un - announced and find out for yourselves .
negative	so i wait with baited breath !!
positive	my favourite clothes outlet .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for the chocolates but remain hopeful they will turn_up for valentines_day in good condition .
positive	car_mats as_described good delivery time

neutral	if the site security is as good as claimed then you should be more open about it .
positive	i ordered from elitekeys today as i wanted to get into wow as i have just stopped_playing my other mmo due to it being pay0win .

neutral	quidco used to be a great cash - back site a few_years back but these days i find that payment seem to take a long time to clear and that certain retailers continue to stall payments 0 - 00 months and you have to chase them which becomes tiring very quickly , if they sorted these retailers out it would be back being a great site .

positive	the website it '_s self is really easy and comfortable to use & found what i was looking for quickly .
neutral	i was surprised that the company chose to openly respond on the internet with a defamatory comment that i had lied in my initial comment .

neutral	the flowers and everything else arrived ok but the balloon was slit up .
negative	if they had a truly local_depot i would have gone and got it but a round_trip of 0hrs is a bit much .

neutral	also , the delivery men had no_intention of taking the boxes upstairs .
positive	great service and easy to talk to will contact you with date changes and very helpful
neutral	i don_'_t agree with the additional_charges for removing packaging which i think should be a standard offering and £_00 to move item to another room is cheeky .

neutral	i have been with healthy_pets for several_years and decided on renewal to adjust my insurance on my 0 cats .
neutral	this was sorted_out by custumer services very promptly and effectively , but i do think furniture should be checked more carefully before sending it to customers who have paid good money for it .

neutral	then you get another text saying they attempted to deliver the product and you were not there !
positive	on the whole , excellent service .
negative	they had to telephone pharmacy0u to find out who to give it to !. i find this absolutely_shocking . by nature of the company ' pharmacy ', what was in that parcel was private and should have remained so .
negative	its just a waste of time it seems !!
negative	not impressed .
neutral	we then rang this number and they confirmed they had received the email and the package was being delivered that day , but could not specify a time ., 0 phone_calls later having been waiting for them to return my call i finally spoke to someone at nearly 0pm who told me the truth that the package had never been coming out that day due to " technical_issues that morning ".

neutral	the delivery service & the communication that came with it were good .
positive	it really is true " you get what you pay for ".
neutral	the steaks all look pretty similar ( with the exception of the fillets ) & it will be interesting to see how they eat as they are fairly thinly cut , which is a pity .
negative	they also agreed to remove the ' fast delivery on this item ' from the internet as it is clearly misleading .
positive	living in the channel_isles it '_s hard enough trying to buy the exact thing your looking and you have to buy online only to be disheartened when the company do not deliver to the channel_islands !

neutral	not sure if the ink has ran or something but one person looks like they have blue lips , the other one someone has a blue spot_on their nose .
positive	as the juicer is expensive , i was slightly_worried that i was buying from an ' invisible ' source ( which could suddenly disappear if i was to need to get in touch in the future ).
negative	as i '_m moving home ( and out of contract ) and was paying a considerable_amount per_month to sky you might have thought that for the cost of a telephone_call for my continued patronage might be worth it .

positive	that '_s what i call pretty amazing service and delivery , i am also very pleased with the quality of the rug , i highly_recomend this company if you are looking for a rug .
neutral	i think the important_thing for guarantor '_s is that the loans are not guaranteed on the property , and there '_s no credit_file footprint for them .
positive	there has_been no_problems getting a replacement quickly with excellent communication from mr_memory '_s staff .
neutral	there was no returns_label included so i had to e_mail physio_room with my complaint and requested an exchange .
neutral	all this time the website continues to show product as " in stock ".
negative	assured by assistant that i would still be able to get swapables on this new contract including sky sports as with my old orange contract .
neutral	another convenient store that repeatedly fails on stock_levels , partly_because the way they store stuff means if they say they have 00 in stock , 00 are probably broken / missing / on a pallet somewhere_else .
positive	it was overall a very enjoyable_experience for buying our first new car .
positive	thank_you for such a quick and easy service .
neutral	bra telefonsupport och_snabba leveranser , men hemsidan är buggig vilket gör det svårt att_beställa .

negative	this matter has now been placed into the hands of my solicitor and trading_standards .
negative	we have since had our wardrobes fitted and are very unhappy with them .
neutral	the delivery was fast , the price was low , but the lack of any meaningful instructions , and the wrong wiring instructions added about 0 hours to the job .
positive	i had not made something clear and they phoned to check my requirements before sending out my new skies which i received within a few_days of placing the order .
negative	problems started .
negative	the seats were only a few rows from the very top of the stadium .
negative	i have also been ' blocked ' by them on facebook , presumably because i had the audacity to post that i hadn_'_t received my order and was considering contacting_trading_standards .
negative	i was told to " do it yourself ".
negative	i payed £ 0 for p_&_p ,

positive	once we had seen the car we wanted they were very helpful and kowledgeable answering any_questions we asked .
negative	also talktalk put a cap on charges and once you go over the limit they simply cut you off . every time !
positive	on - line search found product easily and ordering was simple and straightforward , even as a new customer .
neutral	but the cube was a different_story !!
neutral	had three_separate_deliveries , with no prior e_- mail to advise dispatch for 0 order .
neutral	this took about 00_minutes .

neutral	i ordered a size 0 and the converse i received had one size 0 and one size 0 in the box .
negative	this company is the worst to be experienced since a long time :

neutral	where '_s my top_cashback for transaction 000000 ?

positive	a discount would be nice though for returning customers .
positive	my washing line cover arrived within a couple of days .
negative	been with them for many_years - indeed was with them under their old name of powergen , never had to deal with customer_services until january_0000 , my gas bill has always been high but as i was away working i didn_'_t know how my wife and daughter used the gas - i just paid the bills , however , daughter has bought her own home and moved out and i have now retired - so i can see just how energy is being used .
neutral	disappointing
positive	the keys arrived within a few_days and worked_perfectly .

neutral	i was so looking_forward to trying this product , had such high_hopes after_reading about it , but it made no difference at all to my this hair on top .
negative	i honestly wish i was never tempted by their cheap tariff .
neutral	i would order again because the price was very good , but only if i was in no hurry to receive my ordered items !
positive	after_searching on travelsupermarket . com , ebookers came up with the best price .
neutral	i telephoned and the company have agreed to send out another one , so fingers_crossed it doesn_'_t come squashed .

neutral	ordered on the 00rd november .

positive	please develop the range we ' re running out of stuff to buy .
neutral	they couldn_'_t take it back for a few_days .
negative	how long can it possibly take to process a refund ??
neutral	the habitat sample_tile i ordered was fine but the customer service needs to be improved because the instruction board didn_'_t say how to order it ( only about home delivery ) and when i asked a member of staff whether i needed to order it online , he said yes .
positive	from the time we got on the plane to head for las vargas via new_york we had a trouble_free holiday .
neutral	you ' re only as good as your last transaction topcashback .
neutral	what puts me off about hmv is the postage sucks always late !
neutral	the company also tends to have exclusive offers such as the special ' epic ' edition of gears of war 0 .
negative	i could not use it as i rely_on stock control and i had no faith that i would get any business from it at this point , so why waste effort making a shop .
positive	she was great and being_able to play with my own pictures and approve the wording of my advert was great too .
neutral	however when asked about this i got no reply and my comments weren_'_t approved for the site .
positive	we stayed in a superior sea - view room , which was very large , very spacious , big balcony too .
negative	i '_ve called several_times and they always tell me the refund has_been made .

neutral	the heel wedges which i ordered arrived the next_day - incredible service .
positive	fantastic company . from_start to finish , quality items quality service . absolutely fantastic i would recommend this company :-)
neutral	unless we emailed there was no explanation of when we would receive the replacement .
neutral	that said the box the presentation_box the bottle came in was in an just acceptable condition , apart_from a 00mm blue pen mark on the bottom of the box .
neutral	yet little sad to see i have still had to pay the full_amount even_though i '_m not receiving the full advertised product .
negative	it got to 0pm and no delivery .
positive	like it !!
neutral	delivery came when i asked but the order was wrong .
neutral	ordered the product on monday and i '_m still_waiting come saturday .

neutral	it took me 0 hours to unpack the item and dispose of a mountain of polystyrene and cardboard .
negative	without a doubt the worst company i have had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	0 months or so on , i though it maybe time to try again , how wrong i was .
negative	darren replied it was not just a vehicle you needed but also a driver .
positive	i found the website very easy to use in order to find the correct flex and price of the golf shaft i was looking for .
negative	i run a busy ebay shop , have about 000 sales a week and for the last two years used ipostparcels to deliver my parcels ,
negative	i hope someone from the company actually read these reviews as perhaps then they might fulfil the order and i will have something to review !
negative	not only have i not had a royal_mail card through the door , but considering the other reviews here , does anyone really think it likely that they ' re telling the truth ?
positive	we will_definately use them again .
positive	many_thanks for the speedy service and of course the great price .
positive	i was looking for something different for christmas_present and loved the range and prices available on this site .
positive	i '_ve always shopped round and found precious_little one to come out on top with cheaper retail prices than other_retailers .
negative	of course , my mum didn_'_t say anything to me when i asked over the phone , but then she didn_'_t know i would be visiting .
neutral	so it had all started nice but between the additional flights i had to buy , the one that was canceled and the messed_up refund story , it ended_up not being as pleasant an experience as i expected .
negative	their so called " expert ", roy , told me professionally qualified people such as architects are thick and can '_t programme thermostats , it was then i told_him i wasn_'_t thick and quoted my qualification to prove it , he said he was sorry for me .
positive	it starts with the user_friendly website .
negative	courier given access to a block of private flats , customer appears not to be in , does not leave card but does decides to ( fraudulently ) sign for it himself and then leaves it somewhere - parcel goes missing .
neutral	wouldn_'_t order again unless postage more reasonable .
neutral	customer_services were great when enquiring where my order was and the clothes were great as usual - please sort_out your deliveries !
negative	no one answers their phone .
negative	received an_email from selectspecs informing_me that the glasses i had ordered had been_discontinued .

negative	i placed my order and expected to pick it up the following_day from the glasgow store ( i live in edinburgh , but was going to be in glasgow the next_day ).
neutral	i could not choose a colour myself while placing my order even if there were 0 colours available .
neutral	my current_provider is sky , by default as i was an o0 customer .
negative	the main issues were 0 ) very poor customer service - lengthy times waiting for calls to be answered , poor quality telephone_lines , failure of managers to call back - after promises about this had been made 0 ) information that had been given relating to my booking firstly assured and then contradicted , resulting in its being lost altogether .
positive	pleased with purchase and service .
negative	we ' re still_waiting for a single call to be returned & still have no web builder package .
neutral	there is an assumption that the person using the site is the potential tutee but in my case i was using it for a friend whose english was not very good !
negative	although it states there are no fees , it is in fact a booking_fee for shiply and the courier never sees it .
neutral	the correct goods arrived .
negative	customer helpline is a complete_waste of time .
neutral	i found it hard to find a number to contact anyone as there was no number left on the card pushed through the letterbox .
neutral	item bought , works_fine and does what i need at a decent price
neutral	adjustable features : the bike ’_s saddle and handle - bars are adjustable .
positive	great pricing too !

positive	thornton cleveleys
neutral	i had pointed_out the additional_cost i had made to have a same day delivery and was told the bouquet would be made larger to the cost of the postage .
positive	fantastic service .
negative	i was very disappointed
negative	and when i asked to speak to a manager , she wasn_'_t happy at all .
negative	i had ordered and paid for the shower on the basis it would be available , if this was not the case the order should not have been accepted and payment taken .
neutral	the finish i received was definitely not gloss , but more of a semi gloss .
positive	overall very pleased and will definitely use this company again for any future fancy_dress costumes .
negative	not happy got a quote for my laptop from them .
negative	because i think i will then be £_00 . 00 out of pocket with nothing to mount my tv on .
neutral	i had difficulty paying with my bank cards online and finally had to use paypal when neither my debit_card nor my credit_card would authorise the transaction without_any good reason .
negative	asked to be near amminties .
negative	they do not answer emails or telephone_calls and the next thing will be to visit them in person in burnley .
positive	we weren_'_t too sure initially about ordering something not made of plaster as we live in an old victorian house .

negative	their customer service to me was non - existent .
positive	they have it all and know it all .
positive	very promptly received and well_packaged with clear_instructions .
negative	please read this honest account of my problems

negative	prior to delivery we asked them about what boxes it was delivered in .
neutral	v

neutral	they arrived in good time but only two tablets were in the pack .
positive	excellent prices , and super_fast service .
positive	ordered it about 0pm and received the goods the next_morning without paying for the next_day delivery .
negative	had they worn balaclavas they would get sent down for this type of " work ".
neutral	the online system is brilliant and certainly saves you rushing_around when youi can reserve and collect !
neutral	i ordered some chairs on a saturday_evening and was delighted to know they would arrive two working_days_later .
negative	two new dates were arranged but we had to postpone due to urgent family issues .
negative	they did however find me on the system and told me my order would be coming in by the end of that week .

positive	would use them again .
neutral	was very happy with the price and service from tyre_shopper , even_though the tyres i ordered happened to be out of stock .

positive	naturesbest were exceedingly helpful to me .
neutral	when i came to checkout , it also wasnt clear to me how to redeem ( whether to put the code into promo_code or not ).
negative	won_'_t be using these again ( as well as axis care hire in montpellier aitport - but that '_s another story !!)
positive	i would defiantly recommend it and i have to many other arty friends !
positive	led self_adhesive tape lights , power_supplies and cables / connectors .
positive	recovered a small error in the processing of my order very quickly and made sure the right products came to me post_haste .
positive	free delivery was excellent and then for the glasses to arrive the day after meant i would have no_hesitation in using again or recommending to anyone .
neutral	why this difference .
negative	only half of the ones i paid for stated coming up ; 0 out of 00 , the free ones only 0 out of 00 have came up .
neutral	the products i purchased are up to what i expected
negative	when asked why this was she told me that the order number changes .
positive	i bought the pet corrector and they have stopped , it works_wonders and is half the price in the pet_shops .
neutral	unfortunately one of the products - 0 litres of chassis cleaner - leaked during_transit .
neutral	they apologised and told me to return them for a full_refund and they gave_me a 00_%_off voucher to make up for it .
negative	from_start to finish our experience was very poor .
positive	don_'_t go_anywhere_else !
positive	just , simply , excellent .
neutral	i have had to do a ' print screen ' from my member page for my proof of record of payment in full .

neutral	contract_expires .

positive	we found the sevice top_dollar . never ordered online before , was worried but products plus staff fantastic
positive	“ hi there !

positive	delivery was fast and i have an extremely happy not to mention gorgeous smelling daughter !
positive	fantastic next_day service .
neutral	on hunting through the small_print on bitesizedeals website it states that they may substitute another countries version of the product you order .
negative	the flowers were delivered in time for the wedding , but , what a shambles .
negative	i left it 0_weeks , no refund . checked the website , and it now said the missing towel was delivered , and signed for , with the others .
neutral	we noticed that again we seemed to be in a minority using the explorer '_s restaurant , probably due to the limited menu and price .
negative	i submitted a support query through the website and it took 0 days to get a response .

negative	driver couldn_'_t find drop_off house or pick_up locations (' uncle '_s ' restaurant in centre of turgutreis - everyone_knows where it is !).
neutral	not sure i would use site again .
neutral	as these were pre_- owned , they had no more stock to replace it .
neutral	we left the store and purchased the items online .
positive	dead easy to use the website .
positive	unlike similar_sites that knock money off after they have your phone and there '_s nothing you can do about .
neutral	however , the only real_test will come when and if one of my appliances breaks_down - but i suspect it is unlikely the services will be any worse than under various manufacturer warranties , most of which seem to be provided by d & g , and which are often pretty dreadful - for example we had a whirlpool fridge_freezer where the manufacturer '_s engineers kept on coming and swapping main boards without fixing the problem , and it turned_out the engineer was reselling the new boards on the black market and re - installing the faulty one !
positive	was really pleased with the wedding certificate holder i ordered , was easy to order , came very quickly and was in great condition .
negative	betty graham

positive	always helpful , always prompt , and excellent communication .
neutral	all went well until delivery arrived .
positive	good comunication , fast sending .
negative	the customer service is terrible - suppose i should of taken the confirmation of monthly_contract with a pinch of salt - as you rarely get the same answer twice to the same question .
positive	the ordering experience was simple from_start to finish .
neutral	the plants had " just been dumped in the basket after having been removed from their pots , with no attempt to firm them in ".
negative	recently ordered jumpers and recieved i item when should have been two !!!!!!!!
negative	fine if lots of people have complaints and the case is gauranteed to be a winner otherwise you get dismissed .
negative	i told the waitress who didn_'_t even offer an_apology and took the food away .
positive	booking was at a great price , hotel_room was awaiting us on arrival , a good booking agent .
negative	so so overrated :-)
negative	when i came to rebuild bike i removed the bar_tape and found the £_000 set of carbon bars had snapped almost clean through leaving me £_000 out of pocket as it was too late to claim .
positive	got the goods and the questions_answered .
positive	will_definately_use them again once existing purchase is finished
neutral	i wanted to be picked_up at 0 :_00am so selected that on the bokking page however their system changed it to 00 :_00pm .
positive	i literally waited 0_days and the promised amount was in my bank_account .
neutral	a little_disappointing and it would put me off ordering again .
negative	my kitten peed on the keyboard .
neutral	website was easy to use and the rates were very competitive relative to other online quotes i had seen .
neutral	delivery and products are excellent .
negative	customer added details :
neutral	unlikely i would ever have got a phone_call unless i chased this one .
negative	last_year i booked a holiday for me and my disabled_mother .
neutral	the only_downside is that it '_s not possible to track your package .
negative	booked a hire car through holidayautos and ended_up buying their liability insurance which was worhtless as it didn_'_t cover the excesses stipulated by the hire car company .
positive	bought as a gift .
positive	yodel have been brilliant .
positive	mazuma is a very fast service and offer suitable prices for mobiles .
negative	basically the spa deal never existed , carden park declined it because they had no rooms , so why take my money when deal doesn_'_t exist .
neutral	good computer , good delivery service .
negative	so , i have lost my money .
neutral	they were nicely_packaged and took a week to get here .
negative	when i went to have it fitted at national_tyres derby square , isle of man on thursday_morning i was told that the tyre was not actually in stock and would be a couple of days .
neutral	this spoiled the experience as the boots are great price even better but for me lack of communication made me nervous when i heard_nothing and had no boots .
negative	the only thing i received from bhl was an email to say the delivery date had changed . tthat date came and went over a week_ago and i am still_waiting for the delivery .
negative	i think mattressman has an excellent website , range and customer service .
positive	thank_you
positive	this is the number one website for setting_up your_own limited company , would not go_anywhere_else
positive	from the selection available to the prices .
neutral	i have spoken to chemist_direct many_times over the fact that they miss off either the company name or my name or get the 0 mixed up together . recently a delivery address was made up of the first company name and my surname !!??
positive	my order was security checked as the billing and delivery addresses were different .
neutral	i think what they are doing is dishonest , deceitful and most_likely illegal .
neutral	cabin fabulous quality and good value , delivered quickly from phone_call , but customer service awful .
neutral	this was no good as i would be at work and there would be no one to sign for it !
neutral	if i knew what i was wanting , and had physically seen the item , then i would have no - hesitation using the company again .
neutral	shop told me it would be fully set_up but when it arrived 0 strings out of tune , locking_nut bolts all loose .
negative	turns_out they entered my address incorrectly .
negative	they have completely messed_up my dual_fuel account and have been giving empty_promises to resolve the issue for around 0 months !!
negative	they did turn_up at 00 . 00 one morning , blocking my cul - de - sac , and , after a twenty minute ' perusal ' of paperwork , and a search of the van , told me they did not have ' my product ' ( a washing_machine ! )
negative	all they do is they phone a real supplier company and let them ship the goods .
neutral	the bench itself is good except in one respect .
positive	i ordered 0 humorous t - shirts from next to nothing '_s online store .
positive	beat the online competition and super_fast delivery , love my kicks and will_definitely be using urban_industry again .
negative	talk_talk then charge you £_000 for breach of contract that customer has not even been informed has_been entered into .
negative	got an old , dirty , rusty bus instead and had 00 vips to take from london to ascot !!
neutral	however , again this is another basic function which is lacking in their hosting services .
positive	the very few_times i have contacted customer service they have been on the ball .
negative	i tried_calling but nobody ever answers .
neutral	unfortunately 0 of them were unusable as the front cover had been printed 0 time on the first few pages .
positive	they also have some great discount offers which only get better is u sign and account with them for free .
positive	lovely furniture thank_you
positive	products are of excellent quality and arrive very quickly .
positive	if items ordered are found to be out of stock you are advised of a new expected delivery date .

neutral	my orange phone could access any website without issue and service was good .
neutral	surgery day ok , follow_ups ok , as time has_gone on though not ok . left has not worked , cannot see very well at all , using eye_drops constantly now for a year .
positive	easy to personalise invitations with designs for every_occasion .
positive	very easy company to deal with - backed by excellent returns_policy and always swift delivery in my experience .

positive	00 out of 00 for the instuctions
neutral	i ordered a gorgeous bunch of flowers including white anemones and sweet william .
negative	we went on - line and looked at several web_sites before buying from viagogo .
positive	it was the first time i had used jokers ' masquerade to buy a costume .
neutral	hope this helps !
neutral	i thought at_least one would be ok , but unfortunately no matter_how many_times i tried , there was no action , nothing happening .
neutral	was very frustrated after i had picked 00 and they all disappeared and i had to start again .
negative	why on earth should i pay the trainline for making a mistake ?
positive	being using kite_packaging for 00 months really pleased with the service i receive .
positive	brilliant service and thank_you
neutral	note also that the prices you see are not what you pay - they add an extra £ 0 delivery fee at the checkout which is pretty cheeky imo .
positive	easy to use & purchase from site .
negative	it is laughable .
negative	phone arrived but delivery refused .
negative	regardless of her personal situation , fact is fact .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	with concerns about cowboy outfits i tried to get reassurance about where my car would be taken to .
negative	another courier moan and groan from me , maybe i '_m just unlucky ?
positive	as with most internet purchases there is always a risk that the provider is not quite what they seem but i felt it was worth the risk and i '_m so glad i did .
negative	the due date for delivery came and not knowing whether i was still going to have the delivery i rang - no answer and emailed asking if they could advise .
positive	he kept me informed of how things were going every_step of the way .
neutral	one of the drawers on the 0 drawer_chest sticks and makes a clicking noise when you open it but quite honestly the thought of packaging it all up again and returning it fills me with horror so i '_ll live with it .
positive	i bought some trainers and they were a good price and came really quickly and i was pleased
neutral	if only order accepted delivery witin 00_hrs then silence debit appeared in bank_account but no meds and no emails so very unhappy i contacted customer_services at this point they were excellent seems emails_telling_me i needed to speak to a doctor were in spam logged back in and had to communicate with doctor via a chat box which was a nightmare as it kept cutting off my paragraphs finally had order confirmed but meds still took 0_days now i know !
neutral	shame really as dont_think it was companys fault .
positive	the products i ordered arrived in super quick time .
positive	from the minute i click send , i have no doubt that my order will be shipped in an expeditious manner .
positive	the hoodie was perfect for a size 00 on the top half .
negative	contacted them by phone on the saturday_morning to complain and was asked when would i like the order to be delivered again .
neutral	we gave it back half full as we were staying near by and i would suspect that most people do the same , so in effect gifted the hire firm 00_euros of fuel .
negative	the next_day would have been the wrong day , so that was useless for me .
neutral	ps0 in the shops £_000 in the catalogue £_000 .
positive	thanks you for an excellent service .
positive	the lady i spoke to was very helpful and polite and the order arrived the next_day .
positive	nice rug and speedy delivery :-)
positive	right size , east to fill , light shows it is on and auto switch off .
neutral	however , locked me out when i got to the payment page and when i went back in price had gone up by 00 %.
negative	and then it would go to a holding bay . and then !
negative	rubbish service .
neutral	next time , i '_ll go to the specialist !
negative	alarmed , i phoned my bank , to find all absolutely fine with my card .
negative	there seems to be no way you can call the company and speak to anyone in person either .
neutral	the corners were not protected so it arrived slightly_damaged .
positive	im gonna show my friends how to order one now so we all have one , cant_wait .
positive	the envelope for posting arrived the next_day .
negative	i have now been waiting for 0_weeks .
positive	used enterprise car_hire booked through argus_car_hire .
negative	they did not .
positive	i hunted through many different sites and found feel good to be the cheapest by in some cases a lot of money for exactly the same product , there was one slight_hic up in the type and strength of lenses i needed were out of stock ( not overly surprised have had issues with this from others before ), but when i advised i required them sooner_than they could get them to me and asked if they could be sent out via next_day delivery when they were ready , which i was prepared to pay for , i was upgraded to next_day for free .
negative	so i rang up and spent a good 00_minutes on hold .
neutral	my mum_loved the flowers when she eventually got them at 0 . 00pm .
positive	the knife_set is great , i could not believe_how quick they were delivered and so well_packed .
positive	i phoned them up today and spoke to their glove / mitt expert who gave_me informed advice .
positive	will definitely recommend to everyone i know !
negative	we just lost the property which ticked all the boxes and were not given the right to bid for it !
negative	when i arrived at the store i was handed a beaten up box_containing my new basin and considering the state of the packaging i thought it prudent to check the sink before leaving the store .
negative	i will not bother with that website again and tell as many as possible
neutral	we managed to sort it out in the end ourselves .
positive	brilliant customer service .
neutral	no one had spoken to us or left a message on the answering_machine .
negative	we booked and paid in full in october_0000 .
positive	three things you cannot say of interflora in my recent experience !
neutral	no_problems with the delivery .
positive	the vehicle was serviced before i took delivery so i didn_'_t even bother to open the bonnet to have a look , though i probably should have .
positive	with gear0_music it was a competitive cost for the item and i could select the delivery i wanted at a reasonable cost .
negative	i complained and got a letter to say they will see what they can do and would hear within 00 days .
positive	i have used many pet sites and no one comes_close to this service .
neutral	ordered item early on thursday ( item was in stock ) but did not receive it until late the next wednesday , there was no way of tracking its progress
positive	i would recommend shopping from wineware to anyone who_wants high_quality goods at low_prices .
positive	we put it up for her and she is very happy .
neutral	after finding the flowers appropriate for sympathy after my uncle death i ordered them and paid the extra for them to be delivered that day .
negative	0th of every_month . but you guessed it !
neutral	i found the ordering process really quick and easy and the goods were delivered incredibly swiftly .
negative	answer : ' they are waiting for manual verification which can take 00_hours !'
neutral	however , i had ordered two bottles of opi_nail_polish , a cuticle oil and a cuticle removal instrument .
neutral	the chocolates arrived in time and were very nice .
positive	prompt delivery as well .
negative	think i '_ll try selling my phone privately , i might actually get a fair price for it , esp as i had the phone for almost 0 years and it '_s still in working order !
positive	i had the option of a purchase from ebay or from an established company .
positive	the turned_up when they said they would .
positive	the only delay was due to having to pay customs_duty , and a computer_glitch at the uk delivery agents .
neutral	if delivery had been within 0 - 0 days they would have had a 0_star_rating from me but it usually takes a week and recently 0_weeks .
positive	contacted official_watches and had a chat with dino , 00_mins later i had my gold gmtii on my wrist .
neutral	add to this constant issues with account numbers changing and it '_s just not the same as it was before the takeover .
positive	will_definately use again for future gifting , and will recommend to friends and family .
neutral	only_downside - took over a week for a personalised label to be printed !
negative	it '_s been almost a month and no one is informing_me about my order , moreover they are ignoring me !
positive	delighted with the glasses as well !
negative	without me realising , while i was in the process of ordering , it automatically updated my order to a medium_sized bunch which was an extra £ 0 . 00 .
positive	it arrived well_packaged and also all in_tact .
neutral	and because the email_confirmations take_forever to come you can '_t tell if you have ordered twice .
positive	this was an easy , streamlined process with fool - proof instructions , excellent communication_throughout , ending in a super_fast payment to my paypal_account .
positive	i also had to phone with regard to a query and the polite and helpful service was extremely reassuring .
positive	very impressed .
negative	i did and this is the message i recieved .
positive	all done and dusted in no time !
neutral	after some emails and they had viewed the photos i sent to serenata they sent another 00 luxury roses the following_day that were off far better quality and the girlfriend was very happy .
positive	i have no_reservations_about recommending the site .
negative	when i access the site to deposit money / make a bet it works just fine .
negative	firstly , whenever i do phone there is usually a 00 minute ( or more ) wait for call to be answered and ten when they do pick_up they have accidentally cut me off . twice !
positive	i then ordered it and quickly received it through the post - i cannot_fault their service .
neutral	it is also not clear whilst the guarantor needs to be between 00 - 00 and a home owner , they also have to provide a payslip which for me suddenly_became very embarrassing .
neutral	found the website easy , and ordering easy .
positive	ordered some rather obscure components for my arai rx - 0 corsair .
negative	however , we persevered , but to no_avail - the tablet no_longer works and continually freezes .
neutral	i have ordered twice from sigma .
negative	thanks for ruining my boyfriend '_s birthday .
negative	having paid for next_day delivery i was very disappointed that it turned_up three_days late !
negative	they are satisfied that the actual size is not mentioned in your email .
neutral	i let it drop as i was just very grateful for the twine which i couldn_'_t find locally - but it did sour my view of their systems .
positive	very good products , which were quickly and easily dispatched .
neutral	initially the process started off well , we were told more or less straight_away that we had been accepted .
negative	after calling them directly 0 times to complain_about paying for my shirt with paypal to send to germany they did .
negative	!
negative	bank rules , not us .
positive	furniture really we '_ll packaged .
negative	( god_knows what my phone bill will be !)
negative	great way to run a business .
negative	the problem with this company is despite advertising all prices in pounds and having a . co . uk website and a uk telephone_number this company is based in greece and charges your credit_card in euro '_s .
negative	customer_services are worst then i have ever came_across - so poor that i have decided not to buy anything from them ever .
positive	first time user but by no means the last :) excellent from the design to the delivery , many thx :)
negative	definitely won_'_t be using teleflorist again !
positive	never seen this site before so a bit_cautious as they had great prices .
neutral	reading feedback on the web it would seem admin_charges ( not declared upfront ) are probably the reason .
neutral	very time_consuming , plus you have to pay the return fee .
positive	was kept_updated on my order througout the process , ordered on the friday and received on the monday .
positive	very good service , thanks !
positive	delivered fist_class mail really quickly .
positive	i just wear a t shirt under the jacket and its perfect .
positive	that is what i call service .
neutral	the " crack " on the bezel is perfect and straight , looks_like the intended " crack " on the iphone 0 ( see the antenna configuration ).
neutral	initially pleased as items arrived well_packed however when i checked the items a week or two later i found 0 out of 00 items ( chocolate shot_glasses ) in a box broken .
neutral	however in may_0000 i receive the confirmation_email . at_least it was the email late and not the flowers .
negative	the customer service is abysmal - avoid at all costs .
positive	items usually arrive the next_day and are well_presented .
neutral	unfortunately , when it arrived it was packaged so snugly within the plastic_covering that when we opened the suit , some of the imprinted pattern was stuck to itself and some of the the colour peeled_off and ran into other colours , spoiling the overall look of the outfit .
neutral	i personally find the site a nightmare to navigate .
positive	after_speaking to one of their sales_team we identified the problem , identified the parts required and delivery for next_day arranged .
negative	go here at your_peril , they don_'_t give a crap for your problems , just get you on board so they can claim another satisfied customer , yeh right .
positive	fast delivery , would definitely recommend .
positive	i was so impressed with the service that i got from_start to finish .
negative	i did not renew at this time and put the phone down .
positive	as above will use again
negative	if you know how many orders you have , you get the necessary staff in to despatch them .
negative	everytime i send an_email to contact the service center , there '_s only an automatical mail response .
negative	the assistant said that maybe its because of my old prescription that my eyes won_'_t adjust . what a load of old bollox i thought ( i told_him that i especially left my old specs at home so there would be no interference or excuses this time around ).
neutral	not rereally a bouquet .
positive	then i can sit it on my lap as required and put it out of the way when i don_'_t need / want it .
neutral	upto 00th_february i am still_awaiting same , even_though iwas told it would take 0 / 00 days .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	i have used this company before with mixed outcomes and would go elsewhere if i could find an_alternative , economic source of a wide_range of lamps .
negative	ok so far .
negative	interparcel refused to honour the money - back guarantee which is basically theft and against the trade description act .
neutral	the flowers were gorgeous , really stunning .
negative	failed to sliced simple products on time .
negative	dreadful value .
negative	thye no_longer offer a telephone complaints line .
negative	on a motorway that would take a car about an_hour and a half .
positive	they are normally more_expensive .
neutral	i find this unacceptable , especially from a company like aspinal .
negative	do not buy from here as you cannot cancel the order if it is incorrect or faulty .
positive	very nice product - great effect .
neutral	felt that the more dog_food you had the order should have been slightly cheaper !
neutral	currys ) i could have ordered an item and had it delivered to my local homebase for me to collect .
negative	do not use them !
neutral	if you don_'_t mind waiting a long time to receive your order then weldricks is a good bet , as they are very cheap .
neutral	so , if you want to trade the game in you '_ll have difficulty .
positive	!
negative	they use nightfreight as their delivery company .
negative	i was compensated with only 00 eur on my next order .
neutral	i got my coins my buy now was set at the amount i bought which was 000 , 000 coins it got bought and i only got exactly 000 , 000 coins
negative	i waited and checked the online status for delivery but the status was not helpful at all , i waited and waited and finally decided to give them a call .
positive	whenever i want a new game for my wii or ds systems i will always check shopto and they are always cheaper from anywhere_else .
negative	i asked to be put through to a supervisor and he just kept_repeating on and on over me .
positive	would definitely use again !
neutral	i ordered a green & white seville swing_seat_cover .
negative	let '_s say you have a worrying medical problem so you go to see your gp .
positive	very quick delivery , and they keep you informed via_email .
positive	i found that one of the suggestions i now preferred to my original choice .
positive	can not fault , excellent service .
negative	the area covered is around 000_miles .
positive	i love my new trees .
positive	great company , no_problems , would recommend .
positive	the service was excellent frrom start to finish .
negative	it was quite high up and am not good at that too .
neutral	so i would say to our fellow passengers - please adhere to the rules , and to the airport - how about allowing this system on the ground_floor - it takes_longer to drive up and down five floors for the car company drivers .
neutral	many_thanks ,
negative	the excuses , a glitch in the stock system is their explanation .
positive	recieved my box and sent my laptop the next_day with the free recorded delivery service offered .
negative	0 really unusable pair of spectacles
negative	received further email from conrad at cex wecare ??
neutral	it was nicely made but the quality of the flowers was not good value for money - only one rose and the rest carnations and chrysanths - not what was advertised and what i paid for .
neutral	website very well_laid_out and easy to browse , loved all the videos of the clothes being modelled .
negative	tracking order that was selected to be delivered today .
negative	being a scratch a record this was difficult to ' evidence '.
neutral	what if i had not had such evidence , and yet still would have paid nonetheless ?
negative	we have now made 0 separate phone_calls to them on the same matter & in each case have been told that " someone will call you back ".
neutral	- ve - quality of paper used in printing as well as the quality of printing itself are not very good .
neutral	i said there was nothing about this on the site and i had paid the non - mainland postage .
negative	i wish we had not booked with them at all .
negative	jag betalade 00 kr för_att prova ett par skor som_var för stora i storleken .
negative	my story is as follows :-
positive	their range of clothing and other fashion is second to none in the uk .
negative	i changed back to my original supplier therefore i was only with them a short while yet seem to be plagued by letters relating to an ' overdue ' ( estimated !)
neutral	got child item once instead of an adult one .
negative	why don_'_t they have the decency to ring and discuss my problem .
negative	when i rang glasses_direct the first time , there was no mention of vari - focal_lenses .
negative	thank_you
neutral	thanks fonebank , much_appreciated
positive	i heard about hifx from internet but was nervous to use them and stuck to bank transfers .
positive	knew where the flowers were every_step of the journey .
negative	i am_currently charging my phone via my boyfriends phone in order to have battery life from day to day .
negative	atrocious service .
neutral	of course i had been warned that the formula i had was not flexible so i knew what to expect .
neutral	i ordered 000 bulbs and have used 00 so_far and 0 were broken
positive	fast delivery good product
negative	finally i was seeing the light at the end of this rather stressful period , until today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) over 0_months after my first contact with talktalk i receive and email_telling_me my april bill is ready to be viewed , and this is where i get the biggest shock the bill is a total of £_000 . 00 - listing contract breakage fee charges of £_000 . 00 + youview + box deferred fee of £_000 , so their promises of voiding all charges was clearly yet again another lie and not once did they ask for a return of the youview_box , nevertheless they will not on any circumstances be receiving another penny from me as i have cancelled the direct_debit , and i refuse to pay for their mistakes and lies .
negative	dont really know what to do next as they dont care .
positive	they are lovely .
positive	finally , the cabinet is well made and has attracted very favourable_comments from friends and visitors .
positive	this might be a problem if you have younger_children who are in bed earlier_than this .
positive	i have recommended highly to my friends , it just astonishes me that people don_'_t always take up the option of shopping via_topcashback !!
positive	got exactly_what i ordered from a well_designed web - site , at a really good price , and with fast , traceable delivery .
positive	now they have solved the delivery problem and improved many of their products i wouldn_'_t buy from anywhere_else
positive	the price was the best around and the quality fantastic .
negative	however , if you wish to return items , as i did , the nightmare begins .
negative	something else to sit unused on back of the bench .
neutral	got my stuff in a sale but would say without a doubt that it wouldn_'_t be worth full price .
positive	top service , thanks
negative	con merchants .
positive	we were over the moon with the photo_book .
positive	although i ordered a small part costing around 0 quid it was treated with a personal caring touch , a simply refreshing_change !
negative	relating to an order back in 0000 , excuse after excuse for weeks , delivery never came .
negative	do not use this company . you pay for the goods get the voucher then nothing arrives . well and truly conned
neutral	recipient was thrilled with the bouquet !
negative	no chance !
positive	recommended !
negative	i ordered and had delivered a very expensive garden set of furniture .
negative	har_ikke prøvet noget tilsvarende !
positive	easy to use and payment made promptly .
positive	the tuxedo arrived on the wednesday_morning , within the time_slot fantastic customer service from_start to finish .
negative	may be too much to ask .
negative	when i placed the order , i chose to also replace the rear glass and to change both to white ( something i verified was ok by email before placing the order - got a strangely quick response to that enquiry ).
positive	had a great weekend cheers_guys
negative	told me the expected delivery date to snowinn '_s warehouse is 00 / dec /_0000 .
neutral	lately i '_m not using hostelworld as much purely_because of this and i have heard other travelers complain abot this as well .
positive	the product was top quality and sent very well_packaged .
neutral	i '_m not sure i '_d shop with fluff heaven again but their offers are very tempting .
positive	phoned up for my order as it is always nice to speak to some - one
negative	it completely wastes your time by which time you '_ve turned away some genuine buyers .
positive	silent , wash well , easy to instal , not a bad look too . so what more could i ask ?
positive	will definitely be ordering from this website again .
negative	i have to call back because the one person that handles asos is out of the office .
neutral	i haven_'_t received my latest order ( as of now sunday 00 . 0 . 00 ).
negative	a week_later i returned to same specsavers in uxbridge and stood waiting for ages at front_desk to be served ( i was the only person in line ).
positive	all ordered products arrived together within a few_days of ordering , they were well_packed and undamaged .
positive	i always say thank_you for excellent service .
neutral	also , more accurate photos would be good as sometimes photos are very flatterring .
negative	i had many happy years with tiscali and had some slight ups and downs but when talk_talk took over , i knew from relatives and friends experiences that thinks were not going to be as rosy .
negative	my bathroom was installed under bathstore 00 months_ago .
positive	easy to book and a good price .
positive	great service and price , can '_t fault them at all
neutral	annoyed though as quoted me a price then an_email recieved to offer a lower price because it had minor mark on screen - this is a second_hand phone !!!
negative	dan phoned me the day after to ask if we had got it .
positive	thank_you .
neutral	the driver dumped the 00 packs of flooring at my front_door and wouldn_'_t even put them 0 feet inside in the hall so i could shut the front_door !
negative	my boiler has a reset button which i pressed and i also tried turning boiler off and on but did not work .
negative	we reported this to paypal who investigated and luckily for us have refunded the money .
positive	plus delivery was extremely prompt ( and free ) and the courier made a great effort to make_sure that delivery was convenient .
positive	another product purchased and again excellent service !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i called on friday and it went through to answerphone .
positive	thanks .
neutral	ordered a dress online .
negative	i was so convinced i was right that i accepted the change , - long_story_short - i was right - my meter was reported as reading " erroneously " and the percentage of over reading was documented - this was in march_0000 and despite me making contact many_times about a settlement from them they have made no offer to compensate - indeed i just get the normal " we are so sorry you are having a problem with us " emails .
negative	we hired a car with holiday_autos who appear to be a uk front for cartrawler . com .
negative	when we moved and received the talktalk box i realised i had been swindled .
negative	the top can twist in the soft packaging .
positive	i placed a bespoke order & will be placing another in the very near_future .
neutral	so hungry i eat even more fruit ( quite a lot ) than the book suggests .
negative	i got angry with customer_services and they put me on hold and once they returned we all were covered and they could not explain_why they left my sister in the middle of nowhere and refusing to help !
negative	eventually i got in touch with trading_standards who advised me to write to them demanding my money back since after 00 days they had breached their contract by not delivering .
negative	i will post it to every_single review site i can find .
negative	they appear to have been knowingly selling faulty , chinese made tablets and promoting the fraud by using wowcher to validate their products by promoting a discount_voucher .
positive	clear easy website and booking process
positive	i '_m very impressed with it - can '_t wait to get below the waves .
neutral	called again to be told that i could send it back again or call casio service team .
neutral	car booked at milan malpensa .
negative	no tracking_information provided . goods never arrived , spoke to their customer_services who were very unhelpful and difficult .
positive	great price , god fast delivery

positive	i was kept_informed at all_stages of the delivery and received a text from the recipient saying how lovely the flowers were .
neutral	did come the following_day however , and was very pleased with my purchase , a tap and loo_roll holder .
neutral	i was expecting rather vivid_colours not pastel looking something .
positive	cannot_fault the service i received from this company .
positive	very happy with the quality of the items and they offer very good value for money .
negative	last_week a requested before 0 . 00 am delivery to our customer only left their depot at 0 . 00 am .
neutral	still better_than ryanair though .
negative	i rang them this time and was told that the technicians were out but someone would call me back within an_hour .
positive	well when the first delivery came i was pleasantly_suprised that each item was excellently_packed .
positive	the method was easy to follow and it was good to be able to see a picture of the actual arrangement .
positive	bought a spacesaver cot for my grandson from my baby needs at a great price , it was delivered within 0_days .
positive	ordering was easy
negative	will not recommend this sight to any of my club members .
neutral	if cosmetics now would use royal_mail i could have gone locally to the delivery office .
negative	there had been no phone_call and the fridge_freezer was left in the middle of our storeroom complete with packaging despite our invoice stating that it would be unpacked and all packaging removed . we sent an email to curry '_s and their response was to tell us to phone customer_services and arrange for the packaging to be uplifted .
neutral	thankfully my neighbours were in and accepted it on our behalf .
negative	not what a customer wants to hear , especially when all of this was the the fault of mark '_s electrical .
neutral	on this basis i would not order again as i did not like the alternative flower composition .

positive	the fitter did a first_class job i would recommend them to anyone
neutral	i had too ring the office to get directions and the person was not one bit helpful , it sounded_like i was disturbing her , we had just got off the cablecar at royal victoria and she could not tell me where we would meet a bus to do the tour , wasted alot of time trying to find a stop . maria
negative	their customer_services team are rude and unhelpful and i genuinely think that the delivery staff must play_football and other sports activities with the parcels .
neutral	i wanted a specific av_receiver that was not in stock in the bournemouth store , and although some were showing at other stores further away , the salesman said i would have to go there to pick it up , and recomended a more_expensive alternative make .
positive	going out of their way to ensure they got the lens to me as i made my way to my flight .
neutral	my only issue is the fact i paid for special delivery so insure it got there without the sticky fingers of the royal_mail interfering .
negative	the worst customer service i have ever came_across .
positive	ordered 0 x prince racket .
negative	one thing broken or missing in a large order - perhaps , but not this much_trouble .

positive	its tim .
neutral	if we had known or been advised this would happen we would have made the logo smaller . one lives and learns !
positive	the brand is not available in the main supermarkets , so searching it out could be a right hassle , but it isnt .
positive	i originally tried to book my crossing using the dfds site .
negative	even with the gesture we spent a considerable_amount of time of chasing this up as at one stage it seemed like an invisible offer .
neutral	however they quickly sent me the returns details and hopefully i will get a refund soon !
neutral	why oh why weren_'_t the instructions updated ?
neutral	finally the order arrived with a garden fork with round tines instead of the flat tined version which was pictured on the screen and was the only reason i ordered it , i already have the fork which was sent .
positive	from_start to finish the service from both was excellent .

neutral	no .
negative	this has to be illegal .
negative	arrived home at 00 : 00 and waited .
negative	i have kept all email correspondance with them as proof .
neutral	looking neat and professional was the idea behind making the acquisition in the first place .
negative	i have little choice but to move provider and they will discover that when they next apply for the direct_debit - and get refused , i just hope they get in touch so i can give them a taste of their own medicine - cant respond in less_than 0 days , will assure them something has_gone_wrong and i will sort it out - then ignore them until they next get in touch - perhaps they will then understand just how frustrating it is having to deal with people who don_'_t give a damn .

positive	great service and great selection and prices !
neutral	i ordered two push - on tap shower sprays in chrome finish and they sent ones with white plastic finish .

negative	to pass the mot it needed a tyre , so they replaced just one even_though the other was near legal_limit , wipers were replaced as the old ones weren_'_t clearing the window even_though the " mark " was actually a huge scratch on the glass which really should not have passed , niether should the seatbelt that doesn_'_t retract any faster_than it would take a snail to cover the same distance ( we ' re_talking minutes here ).

neutral	kept_informed about time of delivery etc .
neutral	dissapointed no follow_up to check i was happy with everything , bearing in mind this wasn_'_t a cheap purchase .
neutral	even some of the follow_up appointments were positive but then when i was due for another follow_up appointment and rushed to get there only to find the shops had shut_down ?.
neutral	incidentally the delivery agent told cheap_smells that they had endeavoured to deliver on two occasions - on neither of these occasions did they leave a card advising me !
positive	i would definitely recommend this company and if the prices stay this low i will be buying from them in the future !
positive	dad needs a specific " build up " soup as part of his strictly controlled diet .

positive	james , of reglazemyglasses , is knowledgeable and helpful in deciding which of the myriad types of lens and coating will suit you .
negative	they have not ( funnily_enough ) got a recording of this part of the conversation and nor do they have a recording of the initial call where they say they are from google , they deny they even said it , looking at previous_reviews there is a pattern here as they have said the same thing to other people .

positive	delivered at the time stated .
negative	no calling_card was left , so they clearly just didn_'_t attempt to deliver it .

neutral	eventually she spotted a rather nice bouquet in the window of a house three down from her and thought she would call on the off - chance .
neutral	they love in a small bungalow !
neutral	however , the courier used clearly did not read ( or maybe did not receive ) the explicit instruction left regarding delivery and leaving at a safe_place at my home , and i had to contact customer_services ( delivery ) on a number on which i only had push_button responses to use .

neutral	the website is good , plenty of outfits for my chosen theme , reasonably_priced , could do with more choice on accessories .
positive	go to music on my pc and see for yourself .
positive	the quality of materials used are first_rate !
positive	i will definitely be shopping with them again because i know if there is a problem it will be dealt_with efficiently .
positive	no_problems
neutral	unfortunately with a rug and the cost of returning it , i won_'_t return it .
neutral	sachets arrived a few_days_later , however they have caused us difficulties in that our pet will not eat any food with the sachets mixed through it , so we have had to go and pay a further £_000 for tablets .
negative	many more emails sent and assurances that the remaining refund would arrive soon .
neutral	the shed £_000 was poorly put_together and broken in areas .

positive	we ordered the wellies over christmas and were told they '_d arrive on tue ( within 0_days ) low and behold first thing tue morn the wellies arrived .
negative	the organisation was appalling .
negative	terrible delivery service , please do not order from this company , i ordered 0 items of furniture from them and as i live in " the country " ( large town just outside glasgow ) they would only deliver to the pavement outside my property .
negative	their kidding us , right ?
positive	excellent service .
negative	an insert on the side of the deal said purchase samsung_s0 zoom you will receive the bundle pack free .
negative	waited in yesterday and by mid - morning was beginning to feel slightly uneasy especially as on the tracking it was still showing as being at the collection depot as at 0th_jan - googled xdp express and came_across this website and having read the reviews omg !

positive	i have used 000 - reg for a couple of websites now .
negative	no .
positive	the help from nadine ( i think that was her name ) was very good .
negative	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
negative	i '_m currently a three customer , not out of choice but because you make it so hard for me to cancel , however my contract is up in 0 months and let_me tell you , ill celebrate that date when it arrives and then take my custom and hard_earned_money somewhere_else , to a provider that actually values me !
neutral	overall it seemed the car was not cleaned after the last hire
neutral	so i had to find it out myself .
neutral	after an_hour we phoned , a bit more willing to complain , and were informed that our order hadn_'_t been processed at all !!
positive	this was by far the clearest , easiest and user_friendly site .
neutral	arrived late , left for early flight in the morning , there only for 0 hours , great room , great bathroom but on my stay the electric sensor did not work , offered a room change but as needed to sleep simply used shower instead .
neutral	it is worth_pointing_out however that the box was wrongly labelled in case others have the same problem .
negative	there is nothing cheap and cheerful about easyjet anymore , they just try and scam you at every opportunity .
negative	just read for yourself comments on other review sites , company has a draconian culture of ruthlessly segmenting / profiling their customers based on flawed assumptions , customers sent mould bread or best by products , orders cancelled if they presume your are of minority ethnic background ( of which their pathetic_excuse is that you want to export there already expired products ) is that how the cater for the needs of if you the supposedly top 0 %?
negative	still did not work so i got a refund .
positive	cheapest price i could_find .
negative	!
positive	i was worried_about something and asked a question via the web_site .
positive	because of the off - season ( american_football ) i cut my carbs intake and i am doing cardio 0x a week and have a least 0 - 0 hours sleep .
positive	very fast delivery service and a very reasonable_price , able to track the parcel and know when its being picked_up and delivered .
negative	got a call from jap parts saying they had the right part and in immaculate_condition at £_000 .
neutral	into the office . hard_sell on wax protection and insurance etc .
positive	i was delighted when the door_bell rang and my order had arrived earlier_than i expected .
neutral	overall the car was great to drive and would use car_hire 0000 again .
positive	this webb_site again .
positive	i was greeted_by donna turner and was pleasantly_surprised by her understanding and general attitude .
negative	well why was there no calling_card ?
negative	to at_least last longer !!!
positive	everything was just as it should be - great price , delivered within an amazingly short time_scale to our local fitting_center where they fitted the new tyres , when they said they would ( within an_hour ) and we are back on the road safe and with a smile .
neutral	we are delighted with all our mugs .
neutral	package came sooner_than_expected , but the costumes were dirty , stained and poorly packed . yes . i would probably order from this company again .
neutral	although i am unhappy with the process i had to endure their complaints team are 0_star .
neutral	or go to all the trouble of sending it all back and starting again .
negative	to my disappointment the one shoe was new - the other shoe looks_like it was over 00 months old and been in their shop .
negative	i have still not received any call back from serenata .
positive	i have been trying to get insurance for my 0 granddaughters who will be travelling_alone , one is 00 , the other 00 .
negative	slow to respond to email and no phone number .
positive	blow it . i will now have to order another one for her .
positive	every_step of purchase was straightforward from showroom to delivery .
negative	i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying incorrect booking summary details before i purchased !
neutral	this is a poor policy , guitars are very individual and to personal taste you should always be able to try a guitar before buying it , i would expect guitar experts to know this .
negative	never again !!!!
negative	i have ordered two beds from 0 different companies in the last 0_weeks and they were due to be delivered by the bridgend depot 000 .
positive	i can '_t fault this dress , i '_m so happy with it .
positive	a second pair now distinctly in the frame .
positive	the real_bonus though is the fact they are competitively_priced
positive	i '_d recommend them to anyone !
neutral	poor customer service almost inevitably leads to poor reputation and loss of custom .
positive	as a returning customer i would say that , as ever the specs were great value .
neutral	the coat had two marks on it when it arrived , looked a bit like washing poweder marks .
positive	the website was very clear , and the coat i ordered came in 0_days .
negative	senders be aware . be very aware . use a different postage option . as the couriers have no gumption to think out of the bubble .
neutral	however , more takeaways need to sign up to takeaway . com as at the moment there is very little choice in my area .
neutral	it took a little_bit long for my check to come
neutral	the comments_below are more applicable to dollar at las_vegas airport .
negative	one must assume they have targets to hit on the sales of the care package but no excuse for bullying .
neutral	this is not cheap chocolate and with p_&_p at £ 0 . 00 and stated delivery of 0 - 0 days , this company isn_'_t performing as well as it could to keep customers , at_least this one , happy .
neutral	rnag again .
negative	i check my online profile to keep_up to date with the delivery and the status remained the same for days and days .
negative	when i got in touch with groupon to appeal for an_extension or get a refund due to the misleading_information on the voucher , it was clear from their response they hadn_'_t read or understood any of my message as all they did was say to me i had to get a mobile code - regardless of the fact this would then have been invalid anyway .
negative	i have sent an_email_saying that if i do not recieve an_email_saying they have been dispatched by the 00th_sept then i will be requesting for a full_refund and putting in a formal_complaint !
positive	easy to book and detailed_information to enable customer to clarify any questions that they wanted answered before booking .
neutral	a quick quality check and service improvement next time please .
negative	please_note - this is the second time this has happened .
negative	i got no apology from the adviser , just a supernanny style warning that if i did it again , she would hang up .
positive	good quality trophies and very good delivery .
neutral	i have to commend parcelhero for its customer service .
negative	i am trying desperately to return an item that has_been incorrectly delivered and after five phonecalls and a total of 00_minutes on hold at various points i am no closer !
negative	absolutly disgusting my dog kennel is cleaner .
negative	if you want good customer service - don_'_t use this company .
positive	as simple as that
negative	the ladies in the office had to open the parcel to find the invoice and still it was not apparent who the parcel was for as my name wasn_'_t on the invoice either !
positive	i received a text at 0am advising me of the estimated time of delivery and a link to check during the day .
neutral	the customer service was ok but i have been put to the inconvenience of having to repackage and go to the post_office to send the goods back , await their receipt and then wait for the correct goods to arrive .
neutral	soffan kom snabbt dock tappar den formen och så fattades det skruvar .
neutral	the paper and cover used are very good quality and this makes the items look professional .
positive	i can buy items here that i would not buy on other_sites because the addition of delivery charges makes the product too expensive .
negative	( we originally paid £_00 )
negative	beware profit before safety read carefully !!
positive	fast , easy , reliable service .
positive	my parcel was collected on time and delivered early the next_day .
negative	sent promised refund immediately - no refund until jan .
positive	i have been very impressed with all the response given throughout , updates of dispatch and time given from the premises right through to time of delivery .
neutral	but the product is good and quick delivery
neutral	unfortunately the ticket never came and i got a link for the eticket .
neutral	when i contacted cheap_smells they refused to honour gift .
positive	i would recommend mazuma to anyone easy website .
positive	it has very innovative design features , wheel removal , handle bar adjustment and folding mechanism are just one click operations .
positive	i '_m already a return customer but will_certainly become a regular .
neutral	i e_- mailed them at their new and their old addresses , not expecting a response .
positive	upfront about process and amount i '_d get for the phone .
negative	and the flowers ruined by wind and rain .
neutral	no car available because of strike action transferred 00 km to milan linate airport by taxi ( paid for but hire co ).
positive	great item especially in the hot_weather at the moment , easley storable , good for fishing & walking .
negative	i sent a recorded delivery letter to their website address citing breach of contract & demanding a refund & it was returned undelivered !
negative	i wait and then only bluetooth device is delivered .
negative	also been told i wouldn_'_t receive another bike until the end of next week , its only monday now . but yet the original bike was sent next_day delivery .
positive	i '_ve only bought one product from these_guys & i keep going back for more because it works .
negative	the scheme was ' cashback by redemption ' meaning that we had to mail in our statements and a voucher every few_months ( with increasing regularity ) through the 0 year term of the contract .
negative	hope this helps , ive_used this site once and never again
negative	forgot to do it first time and had to go back a second time and pay for cab both_times as bike was unrideable .
neutral	but when i asked for an increase in the amount i can borrow i was denied .
positive	it was due to be delivered 0st_november but due to being induced early i needed the car_seat .
positive	not only was i able to track the order from the lake_district , via preston to birmingham and then stoke but i was given a one hour_slot for delivery and the name of the person delivering the package .
positive	i am finding huge benefits from them .
negative	the member of staff who i dealt_with in store was steph jones , who was the only saving_grace in the whole matter .
neutral	worth a visit though .
negative	the service has_been terrible and i feel like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
neutral	the price was also decent and delivery was free which is always a bonus .
neutral	after long conversations over phone , they sent me an_email with some details of procedures i had to follow ( duty tax ).
negative	cannot find email or phone number for inquiry / feedback under their " customer service " page .
positive	brilliant .
negative	what can i do ?
positive	!
neutral	the petmeds site was the most competitive on the web for our dog '_s medication .
negative	ha .
neutral	most of the meals were very tasty but some were really awful eg . chickpea stew .
positive	the keyboard had arrived before i got a text_message_saying that it was on its way - and that was 0 . 00 am on the monday after ordering on line over the week - end !!
negative	so to sum_up , lastminute theatre and meal deals aren_'_t deals at all and cost more than face value .
positive	!
positive	i cancelled the order ( i couldn_'_t stand the thought of living with a grumpy 00year_old for a month in the summer_holidays !)
negative	in march we decided to sell our tickets as me and my husband were lose our jobs and listed our tickets on their website , viagogo collected the tickets , up till this point all was good .
neutral	packaging and handling resulted_in some knocks to boxes and we had to open most of the cat0 boxes up to get the starter cable out again .
negative	we said we would like them to actually deliver what we ordered and she very rudely_told us it would be with us in 00_minutes .
positive	i have never had bad service with them , plus i time i did need to call them on a mistake on my behalf , them man who took my call couldn_'_t have been more welcoming .
negative	this week it arrived - 0 months late .
positive	very trustworthy and will_definitely use again .
negative	this was not a cheap order (£_000 ) to summarise :
positive	so if in doubt , ask the questions , their onlne form , when used is excellent .
neutral	then i ordered around the beginning of chinese new year and they went on an extended time off !
negative	arrived at depot ( cambridge service centre ) 0rd_jan_0000 00 : 00
positive	it was red to go with her new pale_pink coat which in my opinion would clash but on the day i could see that in fact it did work very well .
negative	she received them today and i am_disgusted to say that the flowers were wilted , half_dead and were in a vase of brown water !!!
neutral	finding the pick_up location was also not difficult .
negative	i have now been waiting in for my delivery for four days .
negative	i guess a solicitors letter is now the next option and / or a claim through the small_claims court .
positive	i will not go_anywhere_else now .
negative	there was no knock or anything !!
negative	use [_external_reference_] or just anybody_else .
negative	at night it drops like a stone , their plusnet forum is awash with people having the same problem .
neutral	finally after a number of complaints to the catalogue and the courier , i resorted to contacting the ceo of both companies .
neutral	although the website said my order was in stock and ready to dispatch it didn_'_t arrive .
positive	delivery is within a few_days as stated and the products are great quality .
positive	prices are very competitive , and free_postage on larger orders makes pharmacy0u a most attractive proposition .
neutral	instant , easily but not so completed collection
negative	never go to three avoid at all costs customer service is appealing cant cancel or change your service plan for the whole 00 month_contract have been a 00 customer for years would recommend o0 over three wish i never went to them as theyndont have the first idea on how to deal with complaints leave you hanging on the phone for hours on end in the end i have given up trying to reason with them info hope that when my contact comes up for renewal i will be able to cancel .
neutral	thankfully i havent had to contact talk - talk many_times for my mam '_s broadband ( she rarely has any_problems ).
negative	hollow promises about how they are ' on the seller '_s side '.
positive	i didn_'_t need this as the product worked_fine for me .
negative	you can view my reviews under webuy . com
neutral	in order to use the r / a valves
neutral	then you are asked if you wish to take out extra_insurance in case you loose a key .
neutral	unfortunately the reds on the canvas came out brighter than the reds in the photo file ; making the peoples_faces look very red and sunburnt !
positive	my appointment was in 0 days from placing my order .
positive	best price i could find on the internet .
positive	was very pleased with result from both .
positive	they love them !
neutral	there were only 0 wine_glasses and insufficient tumblers as well .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	contact was impossible , the website from the spanish end was difficult so couldn_'_t change it or phone any one .
neutral	i have to admit , when i looked at the amigo set_up , i was a little_sceptical - it '_s a new concept , and i initially thought that it would be hard to find a guarantor .
neutral	returned it and received replacement after about 00 days , but that one didn_'_t work either .
positive	blue_chip '_s description and photographs on their website of the property were true and accurate .
negative	after more phone_calls emails i was told that i must have caused the damage to the item received and a full_refund was unlikely as they had the demo item at there warehouse , so i must be lying about the item i received .
positive	was really pleased with the outfit and the service .
negative	he then_proceeded to tell me that if ann_summers hadn_'_t been notified of a problem , they couldnt fix it .
negative	however , i have had no reponse whatsoever since 00 / 00 / 00 despite replying 0 times !
negative	the lesson i take away is not to ignore negative_reviews as i did in this case from another customer that had a similar experience of the underfloorheatingstore . com
negative	arrived 0_months later .
positive	thank_you again
neutral	lots of love julie xxxx
negative	i sent several emails asking for proof of delivery and nothing more has_been heard from this company - i must also state that i was unable to contact them by phone because that facility was not available .
positive	very efficient to deal with , no_qualms about using them again in the future .
positive	i purchased a memory_foam_mattress for my teenage_son from the ebay shop maintained by memory_foam warehouse .
neutral	however , when you select which date and am or pm you want to have your tyres_fitted there is no certainty that this will be achieved . the tyre_fitter in my case , i selected to fit the tyres in the morning but they did not have them in stock , so i had to wait for the delivery of tyres which ended_up being in the afternoon .
positive	i wanted to take my girlfriend on a trip for christmas and expedia had all the options that i wanted to check out , gave fairly straight_forward options for changing my search parameters and the flight & hotel option was exactly_what i needed .
negative	i have never received such a bad service from an on - line company and will certainly be avoiding them in the future !
neutral	the job was completed successfully but :
positive	they offered a much_better rate than the banks , and the transactions took three_days only , due mainly to the proven systems they have in place .
positive	would recommend .
negative	prestige_flowers have blamed royal_mail but still cant tell me where my flowers are . was advised they could send another bouquet and a £ 0 . 00 voucher fpr next time !
neutral	was on a fixed one year contract for electric .
neutral	customer service not empowered to make modifications to order config .
neutral	they need to see almost perfect english / german / italian / whatever the language may be , if not it can be very easy to get confused .
positive	they delivered parts of the order that were in stock the next_day and sent the out of stock items as soon as they were available .
neutral	you are now taking more making it a bit more worthwhile dealing_with your company , keep it up and i can send you more .
positive	there was even a little problem of which centre to fit on one trophy so they took the trouble to ring and ask me which i would prefer .
negative	the best part is - i actually emailed the credit control team last_week about this , surprise_surprise that email was ignored too , yet they managed to send me another threatening letter just the other day . come on guys , sort yourselves out .
neutral	i liked the flowers very much but not worth £_00 , which was meant to be deluxe , the service was very quick which i was very great full for as i left my order to the last min ,
negative	after sending a email to the ceo and sending copies of complaints letters to them via_recorded delivery we had a visit from a manager , who has agreed to replace 0 window with a new one take out another one and refit correctly and clean off some of the mastic .
neutral	work is good but needing to see as a review at the end would save any changes
neutral	surely the courier should have notified you that they could not complete the delivery ???
positive	anyway , i can confirm that i am_delighted with the price of the product , the prompt delivery and product quality .
positive	this will be great and mean i don_'_t get near running out of dog_food .
neutral	other travel_insurance co . seem to include the above information on their policy schedule or validation cert .

neutral	ordered an ehiem powerball 000 internal fliter and was sent an aquaball 000 filter .
positive	they have fast shipping to keep me going and keep me healthy .
neutral	we had older children with us and for us and we felt somewhat detached from the rest of the group .
neutral	also , i cant think of an order we '_ve recieved that hasnt had a little_bit on the top saying ' sorry these products werent avaliable in store so havent been delivered ' and this is usually about 0 or 0 products from my list .
positive	we were looking for something a little different from the usual curtains selections found with the major suppliers when by chance found netstogo on web_site search , the website was easy to navigate had excellent choices with prices to match .
positive	delivery was prompt .

negative	they are currently refusing to give me the price difference !
neutral	change your courier service asap .
positive	we are so very pleased with our new items and everyone who has seen them have commented on how lovely they are .
negative	in april i received a cheque , made out to the wrong name .
negative	during the olympics , for example , we could barely load webpages for a fortnight whilst icuk support staff complained that bt hadn_’_t yet processed their request for more bandwidth ( the request being two_weeks outstanding by that stage ).

neutral	delivery was near instant .
neutral	i needed to inform them as i had to change my instruction for delivery .

neutral	thanks !
negative	not happy so called the physioroom who advised that i had only paid for the item to be delivered on friday 00rd but not before 0pm as this would have been £ 0 more_expensive .

negative	i was fuming and asked what sort of compensation we could expect because we had nothing to cook on and also had a lodger who would not be able to prepare meals either .
neutral	but : the ticket prices printed in the tickets and also at the stadium cashier were just half of that i paid to the viagogo plus service fee ( delivery by email ).
negative	if someone had listened to me and checked the parcels contained parts requested the problem could have been sorted and i would be a happy customer .
neutral	personally , after this , i am a little_wary still ( as lies shake your confidence - an " i dont_know " is far better ) but this was a one off for me and out of the amount of times i have used them , this is a small percentage of problems - usually they are very helpful and knowledgable . in my branch anyways .
neutral	also the train trip , next time i would book first_class as the standard booking that i received was very noisy
positive	thank_you so much
positive	a no_hassle experience .
negative	staff claimed to be unable to remove wheel_nuts to change wheel but when i arrived at 0am miraculously all nuts came off easily .

neutral	the ferry itself and the crossing was faultless but the food being breakfast was disgusting and on the verge of unedible , was stone cold when served but when cooked was burnt to a crisp , the price would of been ok if it had been cooked properly and nice but it so wasnt it was foul , shame as it meant on our way back we ate before getting on the ferry !
negative	on the 00th_april i ordered 0 nars products from hq_hair .

positive	we live outside of the uk and had some problems sourcing the products and medicines we required .
neutral	without it , it looks like a witch_costume :( they should at_least say on the website ' accessories not included '.
neutral	i waited all day and it eventually came late_afternoon i am disabled so needed them to carry it in for me , got the feeling that they didnt normally do that .
negative	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
neutral	i appreciate that it was not the fault of the florist that the flowers could not be delivered but i feel_cheated that i had been told they were safely delivered when clearly they were not and if it was not possible to deliver to a next door neighbour surely it would be better to keep them and try to arrange a more appropriate delivery time ( even at extra_cost ) rather_than risk them being lost .
negative	asda price guarantee , what a joke !
neutral	and yes you can bet that was last time i was shoping there , awful customer service , good products .
negative	consequently , i bought an organiser at a local shop .

neutral	so yes the items are fine but delivery times lets it down .
negative	extremely disappointing and a total_waste of my time .
positive	products arrived as ordered within 00_hours - superb !
negative	who could i turn to ?
negative	then i tried to reschedule the fibre appointment 0 times this week via the talktalk website only to receive error messages that the service was unavailable and to try again later .
positive	the last time i ordered they were discounting some lines quite heavily .
negative	the sale of goods_act isnt worth the paper its written on and trading_standards have been unhelpful .
neutral	pleasant helpful driver .
positive	excellent service , polite and above all i would tell all my family and friends about this company .
negative	i asked them to send them out by recorded delivery instead .
negative	so we could try and source something from elsewhere .

neutral	steve
positive	ordered part and it was delivered 0_days_later --- no_problems and much_cheaper_than going to dealership and waiting a week
neutral	the cost of the postage was more than the cost of what i bought .
negative	the estimated delivery date was friday 0th_october , which is today .
negative	i don_'_t think so !
neutral	however , when ordering i paid for next_day delivery , and waited in ( all day friday ).

negative	have gradually discovered that this is a very unfair and bias site
negative	they left a card .
negative	i received a poor service , aggressive sales calls and it took a 00 minute phone_call to leave them at the end of the contract with the rep trying every trick and almost begging me to reconsider .
negative	why ?
negative	waiting 0_months for a bean_bag is not acceptable and no communication or even a simple apology and explanation , no to mention no keeping customers up to date on their order
positive	as it was a present i rang the company and left a message .
positive	very happy with service and excellent product .
neutral	i appreciate that this is the postal service that enforce this restriction but it is extremely frustrating when i '_m waiting for a product that i need to assist me with my sports training .
negative	do not ; i repeat do not under any circumstance think of dealing_with these jokers .
negative	this is when we found all the crap spread over the rest of the house along with mastic spread all over the frames and window revels .

negative	the delivery service was very poor to say the least !
positive	glasses arrived in perfect_condition .
positive	there was some_confusion_over the delivery address which they very quickly resolved by sending me an e_mail asking for confirmation . 0 days_later it arrived .
negative	do not use talk_talk - they are scum .
neutral	i returned it with a full_tank so budget did rather well in that respect .
neutral	i then sent phone off in a box , which mazuma recieved .
neutral	we all make_mistakes ; they were returned and , in the interests of fairness , i waited_until they had been rectified before writing a review .

negative	they won_'_t let you board early with a young_child unless you have paid_extra and even if you have the right baggage weight_limit , they won_'_t let you board if it isn_'_t split between the right number of bags !
neutral	furthermore i didn_'_t notice that this particular carpark is un - manned and you have to take your keys with you .
neutral	i have sorted further invitations out but will now look for someone that doesn_'_t use yodel .
neutral	not good enough i '_m afraid .

negative	for this very poor customer service or shall i say lack of we will never use viagogo again .
negative	but i still have a bad_taste in my mouth .
neutral	i have only rated it 0_stars as i think the £ 0 . 00 pre_paid return voucher that you may or may night need is a little_harsh , perhaps if customers don_'_t need to return the items then this could be refunded to the card .
neutral	i am slightly_disappointed , 0 of my purchases have been particularly troublesome .
negative	please visit our site to perform a health check on your broadband_connection ?

neutral	since i am_disabled this was a considerable_inconvenience .
positive	i have bought what seems to be a larger number of tyres from tyreshopper over the years and their value for money is excellent .
positive	even_though it was a fairly high end package the price offered by deep_blue dive was excellent .
neutral	i was convinced that something on the site had told me that the item was in stock but that may have been another site that i was looking at .
neutral	i ordered this item from wicken_toys as it was not held in stock by elc initially then other online_retailers .

neutral	i ordered my equipment from toolstop on tuesday , and cancelled an arrangement for wednesday because the delivery was to be " next_day ".
negative	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely_ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .

positive	she is delighted with the appearance & quality of the product .
negative	today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) i '_ve finally lost_patience .
neutral	overall i '_m really pleased , but it was inconvenient at the time .
negative	a headlamp bulb had not worked for a number of weeks on the car and i had held off in the knowledge that a service was imminent .
neutral	this means from day of ordering to delivery took 0_days which i think is too slow .
negative	londonmagicstore cancelled the order then re - listed it for £_00 . 00 on both amazon and ebay .
negative	very misled by the picture that showed them to be far more than they were .
positive	0th_row back and in the middle - we could not have had better seats and loved the show .

negative	despite selection the options to not have email and telephone contact from either ao . com or anybody_else that they felt inclined to pass my details on to i have been inundated with both email messages and telephone_call requesting my recommendations .
positive	effortless superb service .
negative	if you want the risk of having to pay massive extra costs at the start of your holiday then by all means take the gamble and use holiday_autos .
negative	i eventually gave up again and phoned them in yet another failed attempt to pay off the card and after 00_mins i got transferred to someone " higher up " in customer service who offered to freeze the interest until the start of april when i would be able to pay off the card ( apparently you can only make 0 payments in any one month before their system won_'_t allow another payment on the account ), even_though my attempts to pay failed they still count as payments .
negative	e_- mailed the company several_times , 00 days_later and still no response , no_indication of whether i '_ll be getting a refund or replacement for the cheapo charger they provide .

positive	thanks
positive	i ' d definitely recommend this site , and will_definitely look to make further_purchases in the future .
neutral	if items are out of stock then remove them from the on - line page or at_least mark it as " out of stock " it would be good if you could also request your cash rewards on - line as having to spend so much money in a phone_call to get it is not good enough and also the length of time it takes to get is not good .

neutral	i placed the order which came promptly but on opening the products for use , i felt very nervous_about their application as the instructions on the products label were not detailed enough .

neutral	i ordered a footmuff which only got delivered 00 days after i placed my order .
negative	when they have bothered to respond it '_s ' i '_ve raised a refund request for you ' which never materialises .
neutral	i didn_'_t want a guaranteed after 0pm delivery , i just wanted a note made of it just in case the driver was able to be flexible .
neutral	emailed them first then received a phone_call to place an order .
positive	great company to deal with , no_pressure to purchase but more than willing to send various designs .
neutral	when the next men arrived to fit the screen it was raining and they took one look at the range_rover and told me they could not fit the screen because the canopy would not fit over it ?
positive	the0 tyres ordered are a whopping_£_00 (£_00 each ) cheaper_than i can get them here on the isle of man and that '_s inc shipping just amazing value !
neutral	i '_m very pleased with the laptop i bought from cleverboxes via ebay .
positive	being_able to create photobooks using your cewe_software on my pc and thus having the images stored safely under my control is , i find , easier to use and with a better final product than when creating ' in the cloud '.
positive	arrived quicker_than_expected .
positive	i expected them to take a week and to my surprise they were delivered in two_days by ups through tranglobal .
neutral	months followed with emails and posts on fb etc .
positive	thank_you .
positive	he was made up and is planning to visit his territory .
neutral	see their page on this site for further unhappy recipients of their ' service '!
neutral	however if you miss a bus . it '_s a fairly long wait for the next one ( 00_minutes in theory ) - not helpful when you have experienced road delays and are pushed for time .
positive	now i just need to wrestle them onto my mantas .
negative	i explained i didn_'_t want the refund as i wanted the item !
neutral	the flowers however were gorgeous and i would order again but give more specific delivery instructions next time .

neutral	i also uploaded the prescription , as requested .
neutral	they said that the delivery had already gone , but fortunately they use dpd , so i was given the option of changing the day , which i did .
neutral	took longer to arrive than hoped .
neutral	one time i even called and the agent said she would call back in 00_minutes - and didnt !
neutral	i chose an_alternative .
neutral	i took_advantage of 00_%_discount offer , so did a scour for older release i wanted and found five .

neutral	the delivery service and promptness fantastic .
neutral	hello the flowers were beautiful but very small compared to the picture - this picture is not accurate at all !!
negative	i asked for a simple change on my account ; i was on the phone for over an_hour , was passed around , told to ring 0 different numbers , and my query has still not been answered .
neutral	additionally , i was hit with a $_00 fee when the transaction did go through to my other us bank_account , for unknown reasons .
positive	very pleased and this lightweight little brother is perfect for me .
neutral	quick processing , good communication but sadly delivery meant boxes were left in porch - split with cat_litter everywhere .
neutral	most of my shopping is done on e / bay and the discount 0 %_off your next purchase !

negative	im waiting for almost 0 months and they didnt unlocked my iphone and since 00 / 00 / 00 they didnt answer my questions and so , i can '_t get my money back .

positive	i was looking for a wacker plate and after_searching for a couple of weeks decided on an elecric one rather_than petrol or diesel , as i am only going to use it on block paving well capable of doing the job . fast delivery and a quality product .
neutral	the customer service staff cannot see the order for over half an_hour which means they cannot deal with any errors straight_away .
neutral	only then was i informed that the item was out of stock , and offered a refund .
negative	if you are going to offer a buying service from the uk . make it cheaper and faster !
neutral	i am abit disappointed with your site now , which is a shame as i am in a wheelchair , so i don_'_t get to go shopping much .

positive	would definately recommend using tyre_shopper to anyone !
neutral	did consider returning the guitar at cost and then reordering but couldn_'_t be_bothered with the hassle to be honest .
negative	however , i had a few simple questions about the train line .
neutral	i have yet to get resolution to that , or even communication on that regard , and i have been trying for three_weeks to get some answers .
neutral	if the manufacturer made the material over the plastic_inserts from the same stuff as the rest of the brace it would last a lot longer .

neutral	i was promised they would be delivered by 00 : 00
neutral	once blind arrived , it fit the window perfectly , which was great .

positive	thank_you for everything we certainly know where to shop .
neutral	i like the items on offer but i don_'_t think i '_ll be purchasing any more because of the reason stated above .
negative	unfortunately when we arrived to collect our keys it took a while as they were put in the wrong hook , no big deal but when we went to start the car , the key was broken . now the wrong hook made sense !
neutral	i also placed my order via topcash_back .

negative	i called to cancel after two working_days as the swatch came and the colour said not match the description .
negative	when i got to the 0th gentlemen_who was about to pass me on for a 0th time (!!!
neutral	complained and told that tracking was extra .
negative	i received no answer from myukdelivery until after i left bad_reviews for them , myukdelivery then answered me on the 0st dec saying my refund is being_processed !
positive	there are so many web sites offering " genuine " spare_parts , but this one looked like the real deal - and it was !
neutral	it is such a stupid approach for a website builder , i can '_t believe this .
negative	as you can expect , i will never be returning my vehicle for a full service as i have been doing for a very long time , if i had dealt_with this person at fords before i would have ditched this company alot sooner .
neutral	slow for this day and age and the merchandise was left_outside in the rain .
neutral	i bought a quaich from the website and the size was detailed incorrectly .
negative	i bought two items which were delivered promptly , however i was sent a self_assembly bar_stool with no instructions .

neutral	everything else was fine thankyou
positive	comfortable , and were a great price .
negative	i work in it and if the systems i developed were this poor , i ' d be sacked .

positive	when it '_s £ 0 in high_street stores for a cable which costs 00_% of that here it '_s a no_brainer really !
negative	recieved e_mail from viagogo to say that al is well and that i shall recieve the tickets soon . recieved another email to say that tickets were being hand delivered today by 0pm so i took the day off work to make_sure i recieved them .

positive	excellent service .
negative	he promised to call me back on the day the good were delivered . guess_what not call .
negative	i would recommend not to use this company in future .
neutral	i have had nothing but trouble from parcels being delivered to the wrong_address , putting a calling_card through letter_box without ringing the bell ( on more than one occassion ) when i am in , to arranging a second delivery and they don_'_t turn_up .
neutral	half way through my tyre_fitting they abandoned them to carry out part of an mot that required 0 people .
neutral	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
positive	would definitely recommend great gardens online to anyone and will for sure be ordering from them again myself .
negative	i was also advised that a collection charge would be deducted from my refund which angers me as the tiles were faulty , not as advertised and i had no other option !
positive	would definitely use the chat service again .
negative	it should be made clear that you do not do a weekend delivery like most businesses these days .

neutral	i live in balsall common , near coventry , and on tuesday_morning , having chosen you from your website , i ordered a bouquet to be sent to my seriously_ill friend in blackburn , requesting same delivery .
positive	it really means all_inclusive , drinks as well ( perhaps not alcohol , but we don_’_t drink alcohol anyway ), and hot food is served in one restaurant or another almost all day long .
negative	shiply state they are acting as a middle_man and don_'_t give refunds of the booking_fee but you can have a credit to be used within 0 months .
positive	as for the product itself , it was at a good price , and of fantastic quality !

negative	it failed it '_s test due to a key scratch on the back and they had the cheek to reduce it to £_00 !
positive	very happy with raybans , worried might be fake , but really really satisfied with purchase and service .
negative	company would not accept this and said bank at fault .
neutral	a couple of issues : the l - sectioned uprights were not all at right angles and needed some tricky hand - bending to put them right , and there was confusion about whether the packs did or didn_'_t include bay connectors ( they didn_'_t , and extra deliveries ensued ).
neutral	whilst they continue to undercut the post_office amazon will still be using them so the problems will_continue .
negative	watchdog should seriously think about looking into them !
negative	things get ridiculous here as the talktalk customer service representative then books me an appointment on the 0rd without waiting for me to confirm that that was ok .
neutral	it arrived the same day as promised .
neutral	i said i did not mind this but why on earth was i allowed to drive off without being offered this .?
neutral	), i went_ahead with the repair £_000 !
positive	would definitely buy from this company again .

negative	pixmania refused a request from paypal for the refund , and one week_later i phoned pixmania to ask where my money was , they told me that i had to drop my paypal_dispute before they would give me my money back , in other words they are trying to blackmail me into dropping the insurance and protection of paypal - thus leaving me wide open to them denying all knowledge of any payment and me being over £_000 out of pocket .
positive	great price , great delivery options , can change it by text , and get a notification which hour it will arrive
negative	they scammed me into paying twice then wouldnt deliver the item .

negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone nor will i be purchasing anything from them again .
positive	quality product , competitively_priced , quickly delivered : happy_bunny !
positive	they are a very " nice " company , & are well_worth buying from .
negative	the way that a company treats their customers is one of the best indicators of whether they are worth dealing_with .
positive	in all fairness the staff did tell us there was a lot of packaging .
neutral	nevertheless the experience was positive overall simply because the staff_member was so helpful , and we also got a good deal on the day .
negative	the shop wouldn_'_t release it to the website guys .
positive	absolutely no problem at all , easy to register , easy to find your old_mobile on their list , downloaded the posting_pack ,

negative	to cut a very long_story_short , i sent photos , returned the item and sent 00 + emails to there awful ' customer_services ' before they would refund the £ 0 . 00 .

positive	price very good too !.
positive	use again ?
negative	i have sent email after email and no one responds !
neutral	i was happy about some things and not others .
positive	the guitars i bought were set_up well and chosen after trying several and are played regularly .

negative	actually delivered at 0 and therefore after the time of the office being open .
positive	good products , good price and great fast delivery !
neutral	couldn_'_t find exactly_what i wanted online so rang them .
negative	the only compliment i can give is that i got my money refunded promptly .
neutral	it got a little annoying to say the least and i vowed_never to use them again , however . when push came to shove the prices are good and at_least you know what is happening with your delivery .
negative	!
neutral	said no as this is an expensive piece of kit and i need to be able to rely_on it .
positive	friendly delivery staff .
negative	i am unable to contact the company as i am_currently abroad , also i don_'_t appreciate that i would have to pay 00p a minute to speak to someone to get my money back .
neutral	had some good & some bad_experiences .
negative	the facts are irrefutable .
negative	i really wish i had researched these people beforehand as i would have discovered the trail of customer disappointment they seem to routinely leave .
neutral	people taking calls on average most are not very helpful or knows what they are taking about .
neutral	nothing wrong with the trip .
positive	the fact that it was only about 0 feet in depth was excellent i thought too .
negative	on contacting them was offered 00_% refund which i have accepted
positive	best regards
negative	its now the night before the concert and i still_havent got my tickets .
neutral	do not visit the cheltenham store , as we did , for any help or advice in choosing your items as my wife was spoken to very rudely and in a patronising manner .
positive	blind perfect and good quality .
negative	my husband booked a similar ticket through train line and ended_up having to sit up all night because it was not a sleeper berth .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for more really .
negative	my issue was never resolved .
positive	i ' d have no_qualms whatsoever recommending them to anyone .
neutral	from the moment my initial phone_call was answered the service was as good as it gets , i wanted varivocals so had to send in an old pair , the envelope arrived two_days_later ( wonderful ), they returned to me a couple of days_later ( wonderful again ).
positive	the team were extremely_helpful in ensuring i got the part as quickly as possible , organising a direct shipment from the manufacturer and following up with them to make_sure it was shipped on time .
neutral	will possibly use again as it is not about what goes_wrong but how you deal with it and i was satisfied with the outcome .
negative	it has taken 0_months to get only a third of the cashback owed , they then told me i had to wait a further 0_months for them to investigate .
negative	0 hours of phone_calls and im now waiting for a manager to call me back , but the way ive been dealt_with so_far im not expecting a call .
positive	he also stated that he ' d be adding a further aspect to their test plans to ensure such defects would be captured in the future - its great to see a company learn from an_oversight to ensure it won_'_t happen again .
negative	!
positive	can '_t recommend them highly_enough
negative	nope , i got a chunk of text copied out from some sort of manual , it did not in any way answer my complaint .
neutral	long wait when we finally got to pick_up the car - " sorry_sir , we have none left !!"
positive	i ordered from this site after my usual_supplier told me the contact_lenses were unobtainable and did not know when they could provide them .
negative	i only had talk_talk phone and broadband and in 0 month i have been charged over_£_000_pound when i disputed this i was told they couldn_'_t understand_why and would look into it but after nyumrous call nothing was done so i requested the service be disconnected which they did then sent me another bill for £_00 so in total less_than 0_months with this company cost over_£_000 i have disputed this with them to no_avail .
positive	looks good , feels good , simple to put on .
negative	again , no reply !
positive	carwow gave_us the opportunity to compare_prices from different audi dealers for the new_audi q0 which we have subsequently bought through carwow .
positive	very easy to navigate through the booking process .
neutral	the packing seems very flimsy .
positive	i items work flawlessly .

positive	as there are no additives and easy to keep i would highly_recommend to my elderly friends too
neutral	the network itself has decent coverage , although the 0g_signal is not as good in certain_areas as other_networks .

positive	highly_recommend .
positive	payment was stress_free and communication was brilliant .
negative	i am not fully_satisfied with this company they are quick to take your money for fast delivery however no costume deliverd in time , when i called it took me two hours to get through to them also when i did the advisor just casually told me that my costume would be deliverd a day later as they were very busy no notice i had paid for fast delivery when i started to complain she just said o well we will give u back ur fast delivery payment as if she was giving me something free i would have expected this anyway !!!
positive	very happy with the service .
positive	we have been purchasing items from 0000rpm for the last 0 years .
negative	check in tried to book me on the 00 : 00 , but the system would not allow .
negative	i believe that the aftersales manager was making a false assertion .
negative	they hide_behind the fact that they sell online so their photoshopped images hide the shoddy condition of the junk they peddle , and when you try and return it , get ready for the circus .
positive	they arrived in good time and were excllent quality .
negative	clearly focused on disproving me rather_than fixing the problem .
positive	i shall pass on your good name to all those i know . thankyou .
neutral	re - arranged for a couple of days_later reluctantly and they turn_up at 0 :_00pm .
neutral	however , i only liked 0 of the 0 products i ordered , so the beef_casserole and the beef meatballs went into the bin .
negative	completely embarrassed !
negative	i had issues maybe a 0 - 0 times a month and for a week at a time .
negative	why icuk ?
negative	no help - it still didn_'_t work .
negative	baring in mind i do have a life and work full time .
negative	they failed to turn_up on appointment day and let_me know last_minute , so write to them on chat . they refuse to speak to me about when they can install or cancel my contract .
negative	!
neutral	luckily i noticed !

negative	still no parts , but they are coming in this week .

positive	0 years_ago i had an eye_test and was told i needed glasses for seeing things close to me and i bought a pair from one of the leading opticians on the high_street , at the time i was 00 so i got some money off however they were still £_00 .
negative	i sent them my ipad 00gb as my on - line quote was £_000 - boxed , full working order , usb_lead and in my opinion excellent condition as it has had a full cover on from day 0 .
negative	they never arrived and i have contacted achica twice to ask for an update .
positive	now i may be a bit out of touch but that sort of money for a cotton mix sweater , yikes !
neutral	ordered on new years day for next_day delivery .
negative	after some to -_ing and fro -_ing , i eventually got a partial_refund , less the booking_fee and a £_00 charge .
neutral	simple web_site to find what i wanted , simple ordering system , great price and quick delivery . can '_t ask for more .
negative	im at the point where i hardly care if the product works or not
negative	went to windsor store where the sales_assistant suggested " i went to a button shop to buy a replacement ".
negative	i was seriously unhappy with what i received and want my money back as they where not worth the money i spent on them .

positive	and i will be using holidays_please in the future .
negative	strangely my name had changed ?
negative	on my surgery day , the surgeon told me my cornea in my right eye was too thin and i will never be able to have lasik or lasek_surgery and i should come_back in a couple of years to get the contact_lens placement .
negative	i was told by staff they didn_'_t bother to attempt the delivery as often people are very angry at the doorstep and have a go at the drivers .
positive	having used this service with no_problems , and having the indicated money_deposited in my bank without_any quibbles i would definately recommend mazumba_mobile to a friend !
negative	gave him all details again for 0 people , by the time he spelt out and repeated every detail i gave him , the flights had gone .
negative	i am seriously_considering making an official_complaint against them .
negative	i have three different resolution options from different staff , the last of which is ' just turn_up with your email and you will get in '!
neutral	parcel0ship helped_me obtain compensation , which took six_weeks , but i would have preferred the parcel to have been collected at the time i expected and delivered to the correct consignee .
neutral	i placed an order at 0pm on a monday with 0 . 00 next_day delivery . but it wasn_'_t delivered the next_day .
neutral	i believe swiss_watches did what they could to chase the order though , delivery to the authorised_dealer appeared to be beyond their control .
neutral	it took 0 - 0 hours to get it all concluded , and when i ask for a small gesture , i was told i wasn_'_t entitled any .
positive	so trust and use now when in a hurry
positive	on time and fast fitment .
negative	!
neutral	very good price on my nokia_n00 but other phones i have only go for under a pound , which i think is a rip_off
positive	great service as i was kept_informed by email where my glasses were in the production process .
positive	ordered online sunday , delivered tuesday .
negative	the excuse provided was : unfortunately due to the volume of goods physically received the distribution_centre are slightly behind in despatching the orders .
neutral	however , following my latest purchase i felt disappointed and slightly angered .
positive	ordered one day , delivered the next .
neutral	tracking_link just said " order generated " with no further information even after the flowers had been delivered .
neutral	i should of checked the tyres but being a ' girl ' i took it as it found my correct car so it would give me the correct tyres .
negative	can not recommend this company due to poor customer service .
neutral	i found the claves a bit_disappointing - they do not have much of round sound .

positive	a0service better_than service i '_ve had before from well_known_brands thanks
neutral	as it is , all orders show with a status of " new ".
negative	if i could have left the stars blank i would have !
neutral	great products , great uk prices but deliveries can be a bit haphazard - wrong items delivered , embarrassing when it was a gift .
negative	i have wasted so much of my time trying to chase a parcel i have given up hope and decided to write a review instead .
neutral	after another 0_days i rang again and spoke to someone_else who was brilliant .

negative	really not happy with pet_supermarket service .
negative	valued at around £_00 which was bad enough but then had an_email to say it failed testing as it was locked to a network !
neutral	what seemed to be a good sale discount was marred_by a similar product for less !
positive	when i did , the gentleman i spoke to was polite and friendly , advised me of the issue ( the address ) and the parcel arrived that afternoon .
negative	i would have actually paid for the little usage i did have if the didn_'_t put the phone down on me when i tried to cancel .
neutral	i spoken to member of staff who asked me to take pictures and send them to him , i struggled to do this as my photos were to large , eventually he received them and told me that they would order me a new pair free of charge which was great , but the frames i had were no_longer in stock so i had to search for a new pair .
neutral	to your reply 0_days before the event is taking the mick as i know the person selling the tickets will already have them in they were released months_ago how do i know to trust the person_who is selling the tickets , have you not noticed the other reviews you have here stating that people have had problems with getting tickets in the past i do not see many happy customer reviews
neutral	that said , it '_s a good way of making a few extra_pennies if you can be bothered to persevere with it .
negative	i will respond shortly .
neutral	£_00 is far too much of a difference .
negative	this company needs to get their act_together , i '_ve been tracking my parcel from the beginning of when it got shipped , as soon as it hit this uk_based company things just went to the dogs !
neutral	i '_m not sure if they have changed shipping companies but an order which would have arrived within 0 - 0_days previously took 00 days this time ?
negative	we then get a phone_call to say that our suite hadnt even been made and that the delivery was not going ahead .
negative	i would recommend that online shoppers do not touch this company with a bargepole as my experience with them has_taught me this .
positive	i haven_'_t the time to express my full satisfaction .
neutral	again , there are not many of these .
negative	i wrote to simplyelectronics asking them to replace the playbook .
negative	got new parts then the fly wheel would not work , rang back again told me to take it apart , not able to open the whole_thing could not see what went wrong .

positive	it arrived 0_days_later and was amazing !
neutral	this is to me annoying , as i am one of those persons , who_likes to keep the mail account free of spam .
negative	when i rang them the next_day , they were unable to give any reason_why no one had come to collect our parcel .
positive	wow , i '_m well impressed with both the efficiency and pricing of the shower_doctor .
negative	they supplied us with text_messages to say they would be delivering it but no reference_number should we need it .
neutral	great idea but when withdrawing money you dont get all of it they keep some after advertising on the site it costs notjing as they make their money from advertising which is lies

negative	- all the plans i had for the first evening and the next_day had to be canceled .
negative	firstly , delivery was late so i called to check .
neutral	i should not have been allowed to order the balloon if out of stock and perhaps should have been given an option to choose an_alternative .
neutral	however , communication was less good when it came to informing_me about collection of the incorrect product : a courier turned_up unannounced one evening , before i ' d been told about plans for a replacement ; despite_being told that someone would phone me to let_me know that a replacement was on its way , i received no such call and came home one evening to find the box propped up against the side of my house !
negative	implying it '_s my fault and my problem .
positive	cannot buy this product in shops now .

positive	i am super impressed with the order turnaround .
positive	.
negative	i did eventually speak to someone , explained my problem and they could not or would not swap the order and take the additional small_fee , so i asked them to cancel the order to which the woman i spoke to said she would do so .

neutral	my visits to wilkinson are a fraction of what they used to be .
neutral	goods were left_outside the front_door in full_view of the street , in the pouring_rain , the outer_box was destroyed , if the inside had not been in a plastic_bag they would have been ruined .
neutral	the bag is what i expected and the service was good .

negative	i had a tearful child going to school for his party without the costume he had picked how do you explain to a 0 year_old - not easy .
neutral	so they were embarrassed , i was ditto , and none of us appreciated your efforts at making a same day delivery .
positive	!
negative	no room for error and no customer service - completely unsympathetic to what was a genuine mistake that could easily have been rectified given the fact that i had realised and informed eflorist immediately .
negative	shock , horror , gasp !
neutral	back seat mats seem too large .
neutral	i get the impression that this doesn_'_t speed anything up and there is no procedure in place to deal with island orders .
negative	whilst it arrived today on time , the flowers are completely_different to my order and to me they don_'_t look to be in the freshest state .
neutral	however i was only able to enjoy one of the items i ordered , the merido rug .

positive	it arrived quickly and was evening better quality than i had anticipated !
neutral	delivery was very quick , no_qualms about the service at all , but we can see why they were so cheap .

positive	all my qs were answered instantaneously and informatively , leaving me feeling assured and confident that i ' d bought from the best .

neutral	i have found excellent bargains on here but ive also been dissappointed with items that appear to be bargfains but are extrosioate in p_&_p . also the packaging that does come tends to be way over sized for the products its carrying so i feel im maybe being charged unessisarily .

positive	thank_you very much .
positive	timely delivery
positive	delivered exactly as they said and had ecstatic 00 year_old on the wednesday .
neutral	not the end of the world but on this occasion , less impressive service than other_reviewers seem to have experienced .

neutral	fortunately they had not been stolen !
negative	never trust adverts , they lie , it was nothing like it was depicted & tasted much worse !
neutral	my wife preferred nespresso which she says is stronger .
neutral	mine weren_'_t and there was the need to ring them when emails could have sufficed .

positive	took longer_than_expected but did a thorough job .
neutral	as for myself , i put it down to ; " typical spanish thinking " as i find the spanish way of doing things is a lot less_than exceptable in most_cases , they do not seem to understand that we , the customer are about to spend some time in their country , and about to spend some of our hard_earned_cash there , and would like to get some value / courtesy in exchange .
neutral	some of the packets of cereals were quite damaged , obviously what was inside was ok but a bit dissapointing , doesn_'_t look quite so nice a squashed ripped box sat on the breakfast table !
positive	the product from polybags was just what i expected , fast service and value for money .
positive	quality of the goods are excellent . carriage is very reasonably_priced and the after service good .

negative	the depot manager at shrewsbury has_been investigating further and we have discovered that there has_been an it issue , resulting in your consignments not being allocated to their depot for collection .
positive	i bought them through an offer on groupon .
negative	you can ask simply these questions and all you will get is the same blanket statements without_any real or truthful explanations .
neutral	by friday , as i still had not heard whether the order had been fulfilled , yet alone dispatched , i contacted customer_services .
neutral	all in all we had a great trip , fab boat , lovely food and excellent entertainment .
negative	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .

neutral	at_least then , if something_goes_wrong , someone hasn_’_t wasted a whole day at home .
positive	sent my phone in the afternoon and the money was in my bank the next_day .
negative	failing that they could make them available for immediate collection at the venue and refund their fees .
negative	i responses immediately with all this information .
neutral	the product is very good - i haven_'_t tasted anything that i haven_'_t really liked .
positive	overall , great service .
negative	!
negative	anyway we returned in the week and after 00_minutes this time we were helped out and given a key to view a car .
positive	payment via_paypal was fast and easy and with the secure paypal payment guarantees .
positive	i will keep this short , and to the point .
neutral	another example : i ordered 0 polo_shirts at £_00 each and when they arrived there was a leaflet_enclosed advertising 0 polo_shirts for £_00 ( about half price ).
neutral	the star_rating is the wrong system , the people on the phones deserve the full
negative	after a lot of phonecalls , i finally spoke to a lady_who sounded_like she cared , who ensured i got new replacement panels two_days_later .
neutral	i was advised of delivery at 0 . 00pm , shame a card wasn_'_t popped thro letterbox advising where left
positive	the recipient was well happy with them and i would use sereneta again .
neutral	there is nothing_worse then completing an offer only to find out your never going to get the cashback that you were promised !
positive	i contacted some of the dealers and finally picked the one with the best deal .
neutral	i was promptly e_- mailed confirmation that my delivery charge would be waived , but it would have been nice , and much_better pr , to have had some communication confirming that for future " highland " customers this will be made clear on the website at the point where the delivery option is made .
positive	i could not fault the purchase , i will definitely use westwoods again
negative	update 00th_may
neutral	i was not informed of their intention to close both shops at lakeside but what really annoyed me was the fact i received an_email reminding_me of my appointment the following_day but the shops were already shut_down .

positive	i was fed_up with paying £ 0 for an eco light_bulb in a supermarket where there was very little choice so this was really useful .
neutral	plumbing place seemed efficient with emails etc .
negative	we check all the wooden pieces .
neutral	i felt the service was excellent .
positive	all i can say is that this seller is excellent
neutral	to summarise , a mostly negative experience .
negative	so my wowcher '' deal '' was not a deal at all .
neutral	when we encounter a problem it is very hard to get a prompt response .
positive	glasses arrived within 0weeks of ordering , received regular_updates by email .
neutral	not a good idea , there were only 0 people working .

neutral	thanks for the tracking_number though .
negative	so never ever again .
positive	i couldn_'_t have asked for better !
neutral	there was only one available of the size which suited me , and which came according to the measurements on the website , but all their other pairs back at the factory were 0 mm smaller in width so i had to compromise and choose another style which i didn_'_t like as much .
positive	i ordered on the monday and they arrived on the thursday .

negative	i called customer service again at 00 . 00am and was told this time they would definitely call me back with an estimated time of delivery .

positive	when the order arrived , i noted a couple of tiles were broken , they sent out replacement the next_day .
positive	the shed was delivered on the day they said it would be .
neutral	very 00 / 00 on the staff service / customer_care .

neutral	the parcel arrived within a one - hour delivery slot .
negative	it was not a cheap gift £_00 .
neutral	thankfully my installer was able to work around these imperfections when installing the worktops to minimise the impact on the top surface by positioning at the sink_cut out and on the underside elsewhere .
neutral	they did not publish one of my reviews of a knife ( which was not at all bad ) probably because te cherry pick reviews to make their goods appear always brilliant .
positive	delivery so fast .
neutral	the lady i spoke with was very polite and told me it had been put on the wrong van but would call me back which she did and told me it would arrive that day .
negative	i phoned juno on the monday to see when the delivery was going to be made , and they said on tuesday via parcel_force .

negative	i ordered at 00 :_00am the day before and we had to purchase the same again from elsewhere because of no show , no phonecal to explain_why l !!!!

negative	it is now 00th_feb , and still no sign of my ' express delivery '.
neutral	excellent quick arrival of the product ( male espadrilles , navy_blue size 0 ) but far too narrow in the sizing for normal uk male sizes .
positive	great deal , quick delivery .
neutral	they cover many of the online stores i use , they track much_faster_than tcb , my points are quickly added to my advantage card and i '_m really looking_forward to the boots xmas sales where ill spend my boots points on treats for me and my family .
neutral	having spent over £ 0000 renting the villa , i do feel very let_down by the villa_plus brand .
neutral	completed several trades but took a whopping 0 . 0_weeks from posting my stuff to physically receiving my cheques which isn_'_t great and a bit of an archaic payment_method in my opinion . considering faster_payments are now the norm and used by other_companies .
positive	our delivery came quickly , at a time that suited and without_any fuss .
positive	i would really recommend them as the service they provide is easy , fast , reliable and good money for your old phone .
positive	delivery is always fast and their website very easy to use and the ability to look back to previous_orders really helps .

positive	the set_up was easy and free and any interested tenants sent me an email which was easy to respond to .
positive	we did this and booked a morning slot and our bed_frame arrived as promised .

neutral	product arrived well_packaged and as_described .
negative	i was informed that they would be delivered out to me on friday 00nd_june .
positive	well pleased
negative	i will never ever come_back to your company and i thoroughly_recommend that no one else does too
neutral	i got no e_- mail confirmation of the order which is why it was fortunate that i had printed the invoice .
negative	i am still_waiting for an_apology and a refund .
negative	well , while i was away , the replacement glasses appeared .

positive	as i said i '_m still in shock that is so easy !!
negative	no email_telling_me whether its been dispatched , no email giving me a refund when i asked for it , purely unacceptable and they basically lied to me !
neutral	i have had before from you and they have been very good but sadly not this time
positive	it was easy to use and i found it very useful that i could track the progress of my order all the way along .
negative	by wednesday the flowers had still not arrived , so i sent another message asking to just cancel the order and receive a full_refund as the mother '_s day surprise had been completely_ruined !
positive	this was excellent service .
negative	sent the phone to rotten_apples on the thursday i placed my order and assumed that it would be back in my hands by monday at the latest , allowing for the weekend .
neutral	i knew the box could not possibly have arrived the day after it had been picked_up from me .

negative	when i phoned and told them , i was told they will fit either side as thy are not handed .
negative	this is the second time i have ordered from this company and my experience this time was worse_than the last .
neutral	however , i certainly did not experience a horror story like others seem to have done on here .
negative	i contacted city_link they appologied then said they would re - collect the parcels and deliver them to the correct destination .
negative	as you can see i have posted my ref_number numerous_times i have included it in this review , i have mailed it to trust_pilot 0 times_now and had no response - they clearly don_'_t want to post negative_reviews and will remove this within minutes of it being up .
neutral	the only problem i had was i forgot to book extra leg_room when i doing the inital booking when i rang the office who could deal with the problem it was closed bank_holiday week end i rang on the tuesday only to be told after a ten minuit wait to ring 0_weeks before traveling so thats another phone_call on premium_rate and another ten minuite wait while they ring the air line to see if i can have extrra leg_room last time i only booked the apartment with them and booked the seperatly i got the extra leg_room no problem no_messing_about i cant under stand why they have telephone the air line
neutral	just wish they ' d made this info clearer on their site to begin with .
negative	i went on - line and scheduled a redelivery when i would be home but no delivery attempt was made so it was a wasted day .
positive	they arrived within days without_delay and once fitted and oiled they look better_than any of the others ive bought before !
positive	tatiana was great
neutral	when the flowers were delivered , they weren_'_t really as per the picture on the website , and looked more like something we could have picked_up from a supermarket for half the price !
neutral	i ended_up driving to the procook shop in braintree where it was replaced .
neutral	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .

positive	if an item is out of stock you can request email notification when it becomes_available , which is a great facility .
neutral	lenses are good and match those supplied by high - street store but lower - priced frames leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	like is they ask too many questions about what you are purchasing
negative	great says i .
neutral	there for 0 . 00 , explained other problems , car was whisked_away and i had a coffee in the waiting area .

negative	i am rather disappointed as my first request was not delivered and the money credited .

neutral	very effective ordering and delivery but expected more flowers in bouquet .
neutral	if i subscribed again , which is unlikely after my recent experience , i would confirm my cancellation by recorded mail so that i can not be scammed .
positive	seems a nice product , with quick delivery
neutral	well , i went on line and followed the couriers instructions as to where they could leave my parcel .
neutral	so the site is now serving up as it should !
positive	who needs shops !
neutral	all in all i '_m fairly happy but next time i make a purchase for office_furniture i will keep a closer eye on what they have in - stock and what '_s made to order as a month is a long time to wait .
negative	this is a lie !!!
neutral	it was urban_decay pore perfector and having oilyish skin it meant that the this product became like an oily film within a couple of hours .
positive	when my phone went dead realised needed new batteries .
negative	i then tried to get a refund , they claimed they had transferred the account from the old electricity_supplier , i contacted the old electricity_supplier , and they said never_heard of the transfer .
positive	easy website to use and very fast delivery what more do you need .
neutral	we need to be able to contact you easier when things go_wrong , your customer service is very poor , our contract is with wowcher , you need to remember that .
neutral	the first pair of glasses arrived about one week after my order , however once they arrived i receieved an_email to say my second_pair were out of stock .
neutral	fortunately , it was made of plastic but i had to brush off and fish - out the critters that used it for refuge .
positive	from_start to finish rebecca was extremely_helpful guiding_us through the equity_release procedure with regular follow ups as the process progressed .
negative	then funnily_enough paypal wanted to talk again when they lost their money .
neutral	my emails were ignored and i could not get through on the helpline - every time i rang i was placed even further back in the queue !
negative	i have looked for an_alternative service and cinema paradiso fits the bill ( they even have up to date titles ) however the service i want costs £_00 per_month and now i have netflix which would take me over budget .
neutral	very disappointing .
negative	changed my flight , breached own t &_cs and refused a refund .
neutral	some of the larger , yellow orchids were turning_brown upon_arrival which you would not expect for the price of the arrangement .
neutral	i am a photographer who has used the same printer for years .
positive	it was really easy to order and was great delivery service
negative	i did a screen_shot of these tickets being back on site which i '_ve attached on this email .
neutral	this resulted_in issues with intonation and was always out of tune when fretted .
positive	arrived within a couple of days and very well_packaged .
negative	took my bike in for a service at the milton_keynes branch .
negative	refused and had to pay for drinks at bar , had just paid when we were then shown to a table .
negative	i have only today received a full_refund - weeks after the company failed to deliver the flowers .
negative	good service going , friendly and prompt .
positive	a phone_call would '_ve been a tad quicker .
negative	their_database needs to be updated so people don_'_t waste their time .
positive	would use again !
negative	i got in touch with eventim who said that it i waited_until 0 days before the event they ' d arrange for me to collect them on the night .
neutral	the amp was shipped in only the manufacturers cardboard_box which offered minimal protection and , as a result , several of the plastic corner ' bumpers ' were broken on arrival .
positive	me & my partner went into the shop , they were very friendly & were served by ollie , he was polite , listened to what we wanted and gave his advice when asked .
positive	excellent service , feeluch more relaxed about things now .
positive	the item arrived promptly with no superfluous packaging
positive	easy to order on the website .
positive	stuff arrived quickly , price was good , what else can you ask for ?
negative	this was just after 0pm and the women said that camilla , who would be dealing_with my claim , was out of the office .
positive	fast shipment and good pricing

neutral	hoping lots of new growth will start in spring .
neutral	be careful when ordering on the web_site
positive	would definitely recommend .
positive	the quote was met and that is the price i paid .
negative	unbelievable find my parcel according to hermes " the customer " has signed for it , either way they are liars as no body was in when they claimed it was signed for & if they left it with a neighbour where is my card to say where my goods are , absolutely_dreadful service !
positive	the sign was of good quality , exactly as_described , packaged well with useful instructions for hidden fixing .
negative	i had to wait_until 0pm one day to have this collected for a refund .
neutral	maybe they just save_money by having us punters do the work for them or maybe they would just have charged me for the damage if i hadn_'_t spent 00_mins documenting it , either way that could have been better service if they had made an accurate record of the damage instead of telling_me there was none .
positive	fhj
positive	there may be some brands not listed , and the odd string slightly_cheaper_elsewhere , but generally strings_direct has_been my port of call for many_years .
positive	my old_faithful 00 year_old sebo_hoover packed in thru me sucking up water i never saw on the floor .
neutral	it is a shame because other than these people taking the parcels ( that often seem to have resentful / bad attitudes ) the collect_plus service has always been excellent .
negative	come on that '_s crazy !
positive	was please with the goods and speedy service
positive	i ordered the flowers , and picked a couple of extra '_s - my message automatically went into a birthday card as appose to a small flower card .
negative	ed
neutral	delivery and the album were ok .
negative	is this yet another ploy to discredit their unhappy_customers ?
positive	not happy and awaiting photo to send to serenata :-(
neutral	delivery information on website does not state this only items will not be delivered on weekends or bank_holidays .
neutral	unfortunately though the the zip on the costume broke as i was just putting it on for the party .
negative	on checking the email address they sent it to an e_- mail address that does not exist .
negative	this was definitely not the case , the item was in stock so should have been dispatched and delivered but has not arrived .
positive	would recommend .
positive	bert morris
negative	résultat : ma_commande a été annulée pour rien sous prétexte que fia - net avait bloqué ma_commande ( ce_qui s ' est révélé être faux ).
positive	great place to easily compare_prices and reviews , payments very easy
neutral	won_'_t be using serenata_flowers again .
negative	when i asked if he could contact his supplier to find out when they would have them in stock he said that he could not find out and that they can not track the deliveries either .
neutral	advised that cockroaches are endemic on lanzarote but we weren_'_t warned in advance .
positive	i got sent the delivery instructions and envelope by post , mazuma were quick to renew the agreement when i missed my 00 day time limit .
positive	we hope the experience met your expectations .'
positive	couldn_'_t_believe_how quick and efficient this service is .
negative	stay clear if buying goods and you wont be disappointed .
neutral	must be able to compare net price after cashback with other comparison results - especially true of financial sector credit_cards insuraqnce etc .
positive	got free 00hr delivery .
neutral	and some meals were very high calorie . this diet may work for some people but it hasn_'_t worked for me . it was a very expensive mistake to make to order this diet .
neutral	for my continued custom i would request some recompense .
negative	i find this very unprofessional and out of order !
negative	a call_centre manager confirmed this , and although he raised the speed for me , within the conversation time with him , it fell again .
negative	when checking my e_mails , i had an e_mail with my address it was to be delivered to mum , i explained twice_now , its a present for my mum , okr they said that fine we will change it .
neutral	i have just cancelled the remainder of my order as i am not prepared to wait 0_months from the date of order until delivery .
neutral	one was too_big and the other too small even_though they were labelled the same size .
positive	would recommend .
negative	its all fine their end though when they test the line .
neutral	all worked_seamlessly with the tyres being delivered , ready for fitting when i arrived .
negative	i thought recent legislation states states that online customers are not liable for the cost of returning goods .
neutral	we were unable to straighten some of it
neutral	i had to make a trip on saturday_morning to the post_office in the town near the village where i live pick this up as i was out when it was delivered and had to be signed for , pay for parking etc only to find out it was the wrong one .
neutral	only issue was when the goods came the box was very battered , bit of a problem as a gift .
neutral	a few_weeks_later the shoes were returned to me , no letter stating why , i had to phone littlewoods again , i was told that i had to proof there was a fault within the shoe myself and that i had to get in touch with adidas , now the way i see it is that i purchased the shoe from littlewoods and it should have been up them to find the fault , according to the sales of goods_act , this should have been the case .
positive	from beginning of transaction , where you request for a free post pack ; from receiving the pack to posting the phone to them and the final step when payment is received - you feel secure because they keep you informed every_step of the way .
positive	chose cheapest option - took 0 days - but fair_enough .
negative	if you have any sense at all , avoid chaos_cards .
negative	the company were quick to acknowledge the order but very slow and evasive responding to questions about delivery .
neutral	i am unluck enough to be in an area where i have little choice but bt , expensive and setting_up was a nightmare , was without a number for weeks .
negative	the usual loads of options followed_by endless minutes of waiting .
negative	the second response was an_apology for the first response - and didn_'_t help advance the customer service situation whatsoever .
neutral	no call back .
positive	managed to get on at the back of all the lorries on the lorry deck just as the ferry pulled away .
negative	i '_ve had a 00 month_contract now for about 00months , with a phone that was brand_new at the time .
neutral	i have just returned from spain where i hired a chev aveo for two_weeks and thought i was getting a good deal .
neutral	in the worst case , it had been repeated 0 times !
neutral	loved using this site to create calanders invites xmas cards an things on over xmas its just a shame the p_&_p is so expensive .
positive	very quick to deliver and professional .
negative	when i placed an order . which guess_what ?
negative	within a few_days of wearing both items they became pilled and began to lose their shape .
negative	!
positive	everything from small low key mats to impressive designer style rugs .
neutral	service normally acceptable on this occasion i have been disappointed as my order was sent to the wrong_address despite you confirming my delivery address by email .
negative	heres where my satisfaction ends , the mattress itself is of very poor quality the foam covering doesnt fit the mattress , this may be due to the mattress not being the advertsied size of 000cmx00cm it is far shorter @ best being 000cm but it is not of uniform shape ( not completely rectangular ).
neutral	product was very good , but customer service was not .
neutral	the option of a card that she could carry around instead of paper was great and i decided to go for that too .
positive	then l found this site .
neutral	unfortunately no note was left to say this was the case .
neutral	i amsure i will be happy with the product when i receive it ( or rather my granddaughter will be ).
negative	regards
neutral	it ’_s the total_lack of action to put things right by either party that make me want fart in their general direction .
neutral	the flowers were of good quality and enough stems .
negative	this despite the fact that they fully reimbursed two ladies who went to watchdog on bbc with exactly the same issue .
negative	now as anyone will know who shops online , the usual procedure is that you let the company know the shoes didn_'_t fit , and they come and collect them whilst delivering another pair .
negative	besides from the fact that someone on customer service offered me a discount as a compensation for long waiting but they charged me the full price , and my glasses haven_'_t still arrived !
positive	no real chatty email though , just a thank_you
positive	we were kept_fully_informed of our delivery , which arrived exactly on time .
negative	in the meantime , she arranged for replacement tyres to be supplied and fitted by kwik_fit and booked it in for 00 / 00 .
positive	i changed the delivery date last_minute without_any bother hence i couldn_'_t be more pleased with their service and will be ordering from them again .
negative	i will not be using you again and you need to be 000_% clear when offering tiered payments instead of hiding it in small_print .
positive	second or third time i have used_fhr for airport_parking and as usual very fast and efficient process can '_t fault it really
negative	as well as this you could only record the talktalk channels and not the usual digital channels , each months bill was massively over priced what we expected and if you paused something and came back an_hour later it would just skip back to the live playing .
positive	will use again .
positive	i have recommend the company to many friends , all who now use simplysupplements .
positive	i went to my local_opticians - a big player on the high_street asking for advice on adidas terrex prescription shades .
negative	they messed_up my booking , never told me .
negative	!
negative	waited in for engineer but no show and no service . called them and was passed around but although promised a callback it never happened . so tonight after_reading all these reviews cancelled my order . been transferred to the phiilapines / uk and bangalore .
positive	the procedure took less_than a minute i think in total and i was seeing things i '_d never seen before within a few hours !
negative	overall , poor service and not no customer focus .
neutral	the flowers were lovely .
negative	they sent the wrong_colour and size of pumps .
positive	found what i want on line .
neutral	i '_m_sure you used to be able to track delivery , but i couldn_'_t seem to do it this time .
positive	you cannot rely_on help from automatic assistant as just inserts pictures ranfomly , chopped heads off etc .
neutral	used dpd and they were particularly poor .
neutral	where i '_ve booked for mot '_s in the past i have been charged_twice and this has happened more than once !
neutral	carpets with holes in .
negative	case closed , because a caring - company would have shown their true colours .
neutral	a good range of quality products at reasonable prices .
negative	0 ) stay_away , do not purchase anything from oakfurniture_land
negative	well at the moment that is all i am commenting about , delivery is still for today , but is it going to show up ??
positive	i trawled the internet from site to site .
positive	i would recommend luck & luck to future customers .
negative	as a business i would recommend that no one use carphone_warehouse for business contracts .
negative	avoid !!
positive	their service is reliable and very good and their product range is excellent .
positive	meat tastes amazing !!!
positive	fast delivery .
negative	awful company .
negative	!
negative	a day later they emailed me back advising that they '_ll send another pair if i supply them with an address so i sent them an_email with my address .
neutral	as the vehicle was not in the car_park area , i then had to get it from the fitting_bay where it was still parked !
positive	great waistcoat , made my evening .
positive	i have to admit i was one of those annoying customers who are always changing their mind !
negative	the prices of the flights are over_inflated .
neutral	whilst i accept that people only post bad_experiences , they looked pretty scary .
negative	very disappointed , and p . off spending a weeks wages on that load of tin .
neutral	the bits that did arrive were beautifully_packaged and very good quality , unfortunately the items didn_'_t go with the cut of my dress so returned items which was simple and hassle_free .
positive	they rang me back first thing the next_morning and that day sent me a new box .
negative	my actual rating is 0 out of 0 !
positive	last time i went there , it was just to see the new bitwig in action and ended_up with a new maschine studio !!
neutral	none of them have been large but i am now starting to question whether it is worth completing large pruchases with quidco if it is 00 / 00 as to whether the cashback will be paid .
negative	they could not fulfill simple requests and when i asked for the delivery status of my purchase , without even taking my order number , i was told it in a rude , curt ' get lost ' tone that it would take 00 working_days .
positive	i will buy stuff like this again from kenable .
neutral	i then contacted the contact on one of these posts - simona - who has sorted it , with no further charges .
positive	first_class products and service .
negative	last winter called them out because our boiler packed up ( i '_m not a gas safe plumber ), the engineer stared at the boiler for 00_minutes then told me he didn_'_t know what the problem was , and that i should call out the manufacturer .
negative	the tracking said the flowers were delivered at 0 . 00 to a building that doesn_'_t open until 0 . 00am .
positive	it also easy to buy the items that you require , also it '_s also very easy to use checking out and paying part of the web_page .
negative	kind_regards ,
neutral	the people i spoke to on the phone were pleasant but the process for returning was laborious with little communication between warehouse and customer service which could be simple to fix .
neutral	the shoes i ordered were a bargain in the sale .
negative	!
neutral	a bit annoyed that the " pharmacist " wanted details on using product and using a box with airbags to deliver two boxes of pills was over the top , and using parcel_force to deliver is never ever good , they never can wait_until anyone answers the door .
neutral	the quality of the costume was poor as it had laddered before i put it on .
neutral	after my order had gone_through i was informed my item was out of stock & it would be back in stock in two_weeks .
negative	their website is festooned with acceditation on service which in my case they didn_'_t live up to .
negative	on another site i ordered 0 products from germany and they all arrived within 0 days .
positive	0 minute google_search .
negative	i got american a golf to price match the driver these_clowns said they had in stock and didn_'_t so i '_m happy to use these fools like they use our money for cash_flow !
negative	hardware never arrived .
positive	very pleased with all_aspects
negative	try to use a direct / root registrar if at all possible .
positive	absolutely no_probs - everything completed in a timely_manner !!
positive	key_retirement solutions stood_out they made it clear from the start that they would approach such an undertaking by treating each applicant as an individual thus maximising the offer , michelle my contact was refreshingly open and honest making it clear there was a cost to such assistance but assured me the ultimate provider would fund this as they did .
negative	arrived at depot ( reading service centre ) 00th_dec_0000 00 : 00
negative	instead i got stonewalling and blaming of the italian florist .
negative	noone spoke english and actually asked me what some words meant !
positive	it was all very straight_forward and dean_ratcliffe at key was so helpful .
negative	if you ' re thinking of pacing an order beware - apparently you can '_t cancel your order if the promised speedy delivery is actually 0_weeks - the email repsonse stated " the onus is on yourself to ensure that you read through any terms & conditions prior to placing an order " and yet nowhere does it say you can not cancel an order or that you will face a £_00 charge if you do . watch out for this company - don_'_t trust their website they seem skilled at taking your money ( over_£_000 of mine - i '_m still_awaiting any type of refund ) whilst providing nothing in return .
negative	after 0 days of complains the product was finally resent with a different carrier and arrived .
positive	i have been getting my lenses from lenstore for quite some time now - re - ordering is so simple and quick , i order the lenses and they are delivered within 0_days , often they arrive the next_day , i have never had any_problems with orders and you can get a reminder if you want , lenstore lets you know when your lenses are due for renewal so it is even simpler .
negative	eventually we had to get him to throw it over our garden wall and hope that it didn_'_t get damaged .
negative	pay_pal have advised me not to drop this dispute or i will lose their protection and that pixmania have to contact paypal , but pixmania are adamant not to contact paypal but maintain their stance of me dropping the dispute .
neutral	a couple of years_ago i would have given screwfix 0_stars , but prices keep rising in relation to other_sellers , stock_levels haven_'_t kept up with the product range and the discounts given at the new ' trade_counter ' are being paid for by everyone on the other side of the dividing wall ( cheers for that !).
negative	thanks
positive	can '_t fault them , delivery time is excellent , well_packaged , juice is exactly_what i expected , very impressed .
positive	excellent service and recipient thrilled with the flowers and scent given out from the roses and stocks .
neutral	but it took nearly 0_weeks for my cheque to arrive !
positive	customer service is also good , though once booked , the hard_work is being done by the company you book with .
neutral	if i had missed my scheduled flight owing to an incorrect transfer time it would also have been my responsibility to arrange & pay for alternative flights .
neutral	automated_reply only .
positive	great to find a company that will deliver free to the islands .
negative	they took my money immediately of course .
positive	this is the third blind we have had in the past two months we are delighted with the quality and the service . an order will be placed for two more in the near_future . we cannot recommend you high enough .
positive	if looking for something for your bike merlin_cycles is always one of the sites to include in your search .
neutral	i had to make a series of phone_calls which have cost at_least £ 0 , 00 as the phone line is a premium_rate one .
neutral	?
negative	my previous_supplier ( sky ) never missed a single beat .
positive	very pleased with product .
neutral	which means that when you upload an image , you can '_t get the direct link of it , that means that you can '_t upload any files you want ( which is really stupid ) etc .
negative	i turned_up to collect my prescription and the pharmacist told me that i had nothing to collect , he knew nothing about the on line doctor service provided by superdrug and had to ask a sales_assistant if that was correct .
negative	i revised the 0_star_rating to 0_star as crescentelectronic is trying to cover up my very honest review .
negative	going forward i will stick to using mr_porter .
positive	got exactly_what i wanted , quickly and great quality washing line ( very smart )
negative	so i go online again to arrange delivery on a saturday but according to their website they tried to deliver 0 times already ????
positive	once processed the money was transferred very quickly .
negative	i complained about this and waited several weeks , getting no response from carhire0000
positive	no problem , i knew i would be able to get on the 0pm . the traffic was horrendous and i arrived at dover at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	not amazing or exceptional , just fine .
positive	recently_purchased a grundig car stereo with radio tape and cd decks we bought this to fit in our_caravan looks well sounds great really over the moon good quality and price would recommend hifi_tower for there excellent service
neutral	they don_'_t really have the same online deals like they have in the shop and they are getting soo tight with some of the contracts
negative	it took over a month and a couple of chase emails to customer_support only to be informed the item i had purchased was out of stock .
negative	although anna said that this wasn_'_t so .
neutral	every review i read about currys is bad , they all say the same , unhelpful staff , staff have no knowledge of the products they sell etc , in my experience i have never had a problem with currys except for bad delivery .
neutral	they had to set it all up again .
neutral	i also had one alarming experience where i received an email_informing_me that i an order of glasses had been dispatched and was on it '_s way .
positive	great company - we arrived earlier_than arranged and they were there to meet us .
positive	0 word review - perfect .
negative	rang the following_day to ask the parts be posted to me - only a small_packet .
neutral	i scanned and posted my dvds in a timely_manner .
negative	their response was that they were sorry i '_d had such a bad_experience and if there was anything more they could do then to let them know . again , ignored my request for either the voucher or my money back ( which i told them again )!
positive	do ' h !
positive	a comprehensive_list of choices and options at your fingertips .
negative	citylink didn_'_t even bother , nor did they put a card through the door to tell me they tried delivering it .
positive	i '_m always impressed by how quickly i receive the products .
positive	i ordered ' thank_you ' photo cards from optimalprint a few_weeks_ago .
neutral	however on this occasion i have forgiven the lapse in communication and forgetton item due to the quality of flowers .
positive	they also have a good stock of competitively_priced consumables .
neutral	until i realised i had been sent the wrong_size which i ordered in error .
neutral	the product was ok and arrived when it said it would but feel this could be better advertised .
positive	in a lovely box too which i wasn_'_t expecting .
neutral	once at poitiers , with the car in our possession it was plain_sailing ; clean , easy to drive , well_maintained .
positive	very satisfied and if we needed any further decorations ( unlikely !)
positive	excellent to deal with very helpful and professional
neutral	the service is prompt and the canvas_prints are great quality .
negative	i insisted on speaking to a manager and one wasn_'_t available .
neutral	i later looked on ebay to find the same company was selling the same product for £ 0 . 00 with free delivery .
neutral	ordered rosehip_capsules one day - arrived the following_day .
positive	they were very helpful .
positive	ordered the crystal_head vodka , the big bottle and it was the cheapest online .
neutral	i bought annual_worldwide_cover on the recommendation of a friend to cover trips to new_zealand , australia , greece and usa .
positive	cheque was received within a couple of days
negative	lesson_learnt you pay a cheap price and you get a cheap level of service .
neutral	filled with water again then noticed a very small leak on the element flange . took element out a few_times then found foam sprayed over part of the flange face producing a leak .
positive	service was excellent - they do what they say on the tin !
negative	as an_oap i really cannot_afford to loose this money but really don_'_t know what else i can do except involve trading_standards and my solicitor .
neutral	however , when i rang the office to ask where it was they said that they were sorry and refunded me my money with no questions_asked which i was plesently suprised .
negative	no call from nationwide so i had to chase to find out what was happening .
positive	when the order arrived it was wrapped beautifully and i was extremely happy with the service provided and quality of the product !
neutral	so far so good .
negative	refund will apparently take around 0 to 0_days . don_'_t yet know if that will happen smoothly .
neutral	i am disappointed at the service i had although i understand it was an accident .
positive	you can easily see all the important information .
positive	the speed of the delivery was as fast as it possibly could be and all the helmet parts were perfectly packaged .
negative	unfortunately did not find this website before using sospecial .
positive	i will be using watchfinder again .
neutral	absolutely awful , so i used once and at £_00 i was very unhappy .
neutral	so i guess it was ok
positive	the sign - builder software on the website was very easy to use , and the quality of the magnetic_signs i received was above my expectations for the price .
neutral	total amount again came up to £_00 . 00 including p_&_p , just like with the first transaction .
negative	the order was accepted and i was sent an email confirmation .

neutral	good for price , it did arrive with some of the top layer wood scuffed off .
neutral	ordered some sunglasses after finding a great deal on groupon ( props to that guys ) on a sunday_night .
positive	this is the first led_floodlight i have purchased and was unsure how effective it would be .

negative	i am very disappointed and would never use again and will tell the other_landlords at the next meeting never to think of using this company if you need batteries any time soon .
neutral	having never used this company before i was hesitant when placing an order for nearly_£_000 , however i rang through to ask a few questions prior to ordering and was confident i was dealing_with a reputable_company after i got off the phone .

neutral	it just wasn_'_t worth the hassle of me sending back my new phone which was working fine , and which i '_d loaded up with my personal information and apps , and to be without a phone for an_unknown number of days .
negative	when purchasing items online i am actually inclined to check or ask the seller to make_sure the courier is not actually city - link - only used them 0 times and each time has_been nothing but hassle and trouble .

positive	i found the website very easy to use .
negative	those 00 working_days have passed , and yet the order status is still ' on time '.
neutral	canon uk customer_services state that the warranty of the powershot i was sent is invalid outside the us and that leaves me relying_on the warranty service offered by bitesizedeals themselves .

neutral	i was uploading 00 photos when it got stuck when i was about 00 in causing me to start all over again , searching for them from numerous different folders - so that was annoying .
negative	there is no e_mail address for this company which is ridiculous given that they supply internet services and expect me to use the online service to order from them !!
positive	the medication i received from medicanimal cost about one third of the price charged by the vet .
neutral	i have decided to pay monthly for now , even_though it '_s more_expensive than paying yearly , because i want to make_sure that this is worth my money .
negative	was told i ' d have to wait_until a manager turned_up after 00am as a member of staff couldn_'_t post anything , and " why don_'_t you just come in ?"
neutral	however , it was several days before they eventually confirmed my item was available as stock was being sourced .
negative	not once was i offered any form of goodwill_gesture despite having to make a trip to the post_office , 0 premium_rate calls and a shed_load of hassle through no fault of my own .
positive	would definitely recommend .
neutral	although the wife was delighted with the thought it was more of a posy than a bunch and i felt the wow_factor , i have experienced previously , was missing on this occasion .
neutral	makes me think that the headline prices for the cameras etc are not profitable and they have to make it up with unbranded additional items ( in my case a us battery_charger with no uk adapter supplied - now being corrected ).
neutral	the service and food was very good and this managed to cheer me up .
positive	will use them again .
negative	i received the phone quickly the next_day ( no problem there ), but soon realised it wasn_'_t the phone for me .
neutral	in total i feel that for what i paid , this was a disappointing experience as i have already said and i will not be recommending this to my friends and family .
positive	very pleased with my costume and will definitly pay another visit .
positive	they are amazing , very fast and friendly . easy to add funds to your account and make calls to any country .
positive	really good service and if you have any_problems they are right there to help .

negative	it looks awful and it doesn_'_t work .
positive	i ordered some additional memory and key ring phone chargers using standard delivery .
neutral	?
neutral	great site , excellence quality of product but disappointed with delievery of product it took over 00 days to arrive and the item was in stock when ordered !
negative	this dust , being metallic , was getting on the power contacts in the unit and causing an earth loop tripping the rcd .
positive	i will recommend watchfinder to anyone who_wants to spend a couple of hundreds to thousands you will get your moneys_worth likewise if you have a awatch for sale .
neutral	lee also advised me that the internal brackets had not been delivered but should arrive the following_day – at no time were we advised of this in_advance by hammonds .
negative	waited for the other pair of glasses to see if they were the same , but they never turned_up .
negative	their manager to whom everything is referred to for action , never rings back , hides behind the telephonist .
positive	monies was in my account the same day they got the phone . will use everytime :)
negative	i was on the phone to her on the day of delivery and received the text_confirming the delivery , whilst on the phone to said recipient .
neutral	i bought with 00_%_off which was probably passed_onto the florist so less allowance for the flowers they had to supply .
negative	all i received was a cancellation notice from paypal , so until i emailed pharmacy 0 u ,
negative	is it no wonder this country is going down the pan when we have to deal with incompetent companies like that .
positive	the puzzles has not been opened as they are gifts but they are in strong colourful boxes and i am very pleased with them .
neutral	we entered the garage using the code provided but could not find the parking place for the flat we had booked .
positive	it all turned_out well .
neutral	at oakland i finally found the bedside_cabinet i was looking for .
neutral	i usually look online to see what your current prices are and then contact my local_store to agree the items and deal with danny directly who is great .
neutral	i think it is very underhand the way they lure you in saying they are the best price but this price is not actually the price at all .
negative	he also said i should download naza assistant v0 . 00 .
neutral	i have received over 00 sales emails from you already this month !
positive	an excellent service , which is becoming a rareity , have used it twice and about to place my third order now
neutral	whereas the chicken_breasts were really great and good value for money , the lamb_shanks i had ordered seemed far too expensive and i would not order them again .
positive	and of course , you can have the lights anywhere without having to worry_about a power_supply .
neutral	shopping with " chemist_direct is easy but what i think is a bit_pricey is the postage ,
positive	especially like the text service that lets you know when the flowers are on their way and when they have been delivered .
negative	interesting that two_separate items had the same consignment numbers - delivery arrived monday as promised and then the fun started only one of the two items on board so contact the couriers who said that worldstores had only sent them one item for delivery .
positive	!
neutral	unfortunately i wasn_'_t there when it arrived , so my wife accepted it and arranged it in the vase .
neutral	they then can be difficult to deal with in returning an item for exchange , and will not refund the postage for sending wrong items back .
negative	as i hadn_'_t heard_anything by 00th_december i contacted darren reay and was informed he had a throat infection .
positive	only one draw back , you have to be quick if you see something you like as there products soon sell in popular_sizes but then that just shows how great very is if stock sells quickly .
positive	cheaper_than other_garages i checked .
negative	ordered a bass speaker with email on 00 june saying it will be with you next working day .
negative	i rang them myself and they said they had not been contacted by interparcel but would look into the issue .
negative	anyway to cut along story_short , today ( 00th janaury ) they have finally admitted they have no stock and are cancelling the order and refunding my money .
positive	an easy to use web_site that allows you to see your completed product .
neutral	great price , great availability but awful service .

neutral	was a little disappointed with them .

positive	many_thanks .

neutral	my final comment , read all you can and make an educated decision before going ahead with this treatment .
neutral	they then sent me the item which i received the next_day .
positive	order delivered promptly without_any hassle .
neutral	i hope to be able to seek some advice to the appropriate use of the products for my clients specific conditions based on the recommended dosage and others .
neutral	consequently , any other damage which might have happened while we were away could easily have been added .
neutral	to be honest i think they are the most disgusting thing i have ever_tasted !
positive	russell
negative	delivery promised within 0 to 0 ' working_days '.
positive	i can '_t praise them highly_enough !
negative	they were sorry and they would refund me half the cost .
negative	i was contacted by boots to tell me my parcel would be delivered on 00th_jan_0000 .
neutral	so , initially thought - here we go again but homebase redeemed_themselves , sorry though only 0_stars as the delivery was a day late .
positive	this is the second time i have ordered from them and had no_problems at all .
negative	i only gave this one star because zero_stars is not possible .
negative	unable to review as have not received the order .
negative	ordered a tv because it was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	the supplier offered a 0 night refund which was ok .
negative	no reply .
neutral	first they put a limit on how much you need to spend for you to qualify for supersaver delivery , then they delay the delivery of goods till the following week .
positive	i '_m dealing_with human_beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
neutral	eye - watering !
positive	very impressed with prompt dispatch and postage .
positive	we ' re planning a trip to florida next june , probably a stay in orlando then a cruise from port canaveral .
positive	great product , great service .
positive	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate in recommending mazuma .
negative	i was told several_times that someone will call me back to resolve the issue , but they never did .
neutral	somehow i ended_up paying twice after having bought and entered my voucher_code with printerpix .
neutral	the shop were polite and offered to cancel the order but the price was good so i decided to stick with it and wait .
negative	very , very disappointed with the level of service offered by allbeauty .
positive	i am really pleased with my vehicle .
positive	needed some advice about webber_bbq accessories .
negative	learn from my mistake and find somewhere_else to buy your phone - it might look like a bargain but it '_s just an elaborate scam .
neutral	just after christmas when the item was received the delivery went impressively well .
positive	easy to return unwanted glasses , but somehow i ended_up on the us web_site which could of been costly at the postoffice .
neutral	unfortunately , our guide spent the entire journey yawning , holding his head in his hands and generally behaving as if he wished he were at home in bed .
neutral	browsed online , ordered for my kid and items delivered with no_problems .
negative	when questioned about this , i was told that sometimes they use scheduled flights , sometimes they use charter flights .
positive	drum set fantastic , brill colour and sounds great .
neutral	just a pity i found it on ribble too late .
negative	they only conned £_00 . 00 out of me but i am still pursuing them through trading_standards .
positive	first the samples were chosen and they came quickly ( a couple of days ).
neutral	obviously i bought it from the other retailer but would have preferred amazon due to their easy return process .
neutral	i thought it was a twenty_four hour delivery although it was about 0 oclock friday when i ordered but still didn_'_t receive parcel till wednesday
neutral	very quick and easy to do .
negative	i rang customer service and was told to email . why when i am talking to you ?????
negative	ordered flowers to be delivered for someone '_s 00th_birthday , gave plenty of notice i . e .
neutral	when i turned the box around i could hear all the bits inside , i was dreading what i would find inside , the packaging looked great , well secure so i was really disappointed that many of the cigarillos had bits that crumbled off them , there were about 00 that were broken , which isn_'_t too bad out of 000 , but lots of them had bits crumbled off 😟
negative	never ever use serenata , they are not customer friendly , deliver sub_standard product and do not compromise with the customer
positive	very impressed .
positive	the reviews are pretty reliable , and there are generally plenty of them , and ultimately volume doesn_'_t lie !
positive	i always use envirofone , and has done numerous_times , as they always give you the price that they quote .
positive	very impressed and will_continue to use !
negative	no email to advise of a delay .
neutral	get me in got me in but i had to pay a wee_bit extra to secure the tickets , then had to pay additional fees on top .
negative	i began to sell on amazon and quickly became frustrated with the allocated postage_costs on books which does not take into_consideration different_sizes and weights .
neutral	so far so good !
neutral	update .
positive	ordered it 0_months_ago and paid in full .
negative	thanks very much marks_electrical . meanwhile my money is sitting in their account and i have nothing to show for it .
negative	no communication , the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing and the whole attitude of a manager who could not be bothered to contact me throughout the whole_process .
negative	then i did it again .
negative	said the following saturday but i was not willing to pay another extra_charge for a saturday delivery and i wanted a refund of the extra_charge that i had already paid .
neutral	perhaps they were special ' sale quality '?
neutral	good job id tried to sell it on ebay earlier so i had all the photos to prove it was in prefect_condition a quick phone_call to zoom_fish and they honnored the original quote
negative	i am still_waiting for my refund which i am told will be next , this means i will have have 0 wait 0_weeks for my money .

positive	alexa
negative	easy wellies hard lesson .
positive	i was really happy with how easy it was and that i didn_'_t need to have a new eye_test when i knew my prescription was correct and hadn_'_t changed .
neutral	it is clear - as with most growing companies - that they want you to avoid contacting the customer service team , but when you do they respond well within the allotted_time given at the stage of submission , but more often than not with a standard response .
negative	in summary don_'_t do it !
negative	waste of time .
negative	the medusa garment looked superb in the picture until i went to try it on and before i properly pulled the zip up the fastener came away in my hand .
negative	i gave his details , shock_horror gasp !

negative	if this isn_'_t resolved soon i will be leaving talktalk and go else where .
positive	i like getting the weekly newsletter and the helpful forums .
positive	the whole_experience of ordering from this company has_been excellent .
negative	attempt to contact customer_support appears to have been ignored .
neutral	i was disappointed that it didn_'_t come with the file box sections and the price of buying these through you was insult to injury !
positive	thanks and best_wishes
positive	the money went into the bank the same day as mazuma got it .
neutral	i then got a conflicting email_saying they were out of stock when i questioned this they said this was true but when i went on to the website and via other website such as amazon they said they were still in stock and at a cheaper price .
positive	strings_direct have a great website .
neutral	they arrived promptly but the popper fastening was broken .
positive	good quality storage_boxes better_than i had hoped for .
negative	on their website it does not state that this will be the case if you have to return any product on the contriary it states the opposite as it says " dont worry , if you have a faulty item we will arrange to either replace or refund , standard 00 days no_quibble returns_policy ".
negative	how dear they treat my grandmother and me with contempt like that time to come down on talk_talk like a ton of bricks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	a decent ball but not too expensive when sending them for a swim in the numerous water hazards at my club .
negative	i was told that by 0pm today the delivery company would call and tell me when re - delivery would be .
negative	i was not happy with the explanation however my main_concern was to recover my money and to go to another , more reliable limo hire company .
positive	wonderful choice of oils , but l especially like the blended oils as l can use ready to suit my needs , they have been very helpful this last six_months , around some very stressful & sad times .
negative	i cancelled the order on the 0th_march as it had not been fullfilled and i had not even had the courtesy of any communication .
positive	the guys at watchfinder mad the purchase extremely easy for me and the watch was delivered to my home exactly " on time " !!
neutral	so lots of wasted time and irritation - plus a loss of confidence in what autoglass had advised me .
positive	you are never quite sure what you are going to get when ordering flowers on line but i have to say , with the emails i received letting_me know the order had been received , despatched and delivered i was kept_fully_informed .
negative	stay_away unless you get confirmation on the phone that they have items available for immediate delivery .
negative	despite constant attempts to get in touch with this company ( including having to do research and get a different number from another site he '_s involved with , petrotools ) i still have no goods or refund after 0 year .

neutral	to my shock i noticed dust everywhere .
positive	never used an online pharmacy before but am so glad i did , no queuing or car parking only great service , order placed in afternoon delivered next_morning , what can i say no_fuss or hassle , i '_m even thinking of letting them handle my repeat_prescription , thanks pharmacy0u .

positive	cant_fault the service and value
negative	i ordered £_000 of windows 0 software from them on 0th_september .
neutral	easy to fit .
positive	i was slightly_concerned as i did not know the florist and what their arrangements and service would be like .
positive	and cracking customer service when required .
negative	but if you complain_about their systems , practices or operational methods , you get nowhere .
neutral	broadband as everyone_knows is rapid , yes you never get the full speed quoted but it is more than most will ever need , soon to be increased too .
neutral	they did however leave them on the back step , and came back on the friday to pick_up the damaged shelves .
negative	my emails have gone_unanswered .
neutral	delivery address 00 sheepcot drive watford herts wd000dz email not going to you regards kathy
neutral	i just felt i still do not know whether i can get a ferry to orknwy or not although i have paid for it .
neutral	disappointing but looks_like an earlier version of the shorts with the same name - diesel '_s fault for naming everything the same - or someone has photographed the wrong shorts - not a great loss overall i suppose
negative	the website doesn_'_t tell you what fixings would fit with that gate , which makes_sense as buyfencingdirect sales_dept .
negative	they do not sent out new shoes unless you pay again and reorder and refund takes up to 00 days .
negative	standard shipping ?
positive	- fast
neutral	to be fair , optimalprint were speedy in their response and re - sent my order to be which i received a day or two later and they were lovely .

negative	and so it continued .
negative	the cleaner called me and said she had got so lost ( she only lives 0 miles_away from my home ) that she was now an_hour away .
positive	very quick_turnaround , helpful and communicative staff and exceptionally fast delivery after dispatch .
neutral	i arrived at palma and boarded the bus at about 00 : 00 .
positive	batteries arrived really quickly , and posted via_parcelforce too which means that when we weren_'_t in , they dropped the package off at our local post_office .
negative	rang them - us number , to be re - routed to a uk office !
negative	further , upon_contacting the store via_email - as suggested in confirmation emails from cashgenerator . co . uk - i have not had my issue solved .
neutral	things were sorted in the end however , i did accept damaged goods ( which were eventually refunded ), and only because i was sick of waiting for the replaced items , however the cost of my time calling and my extra workmen costs as the order was incorrect in the first place has rather soured my experience with the company .
negative	just wish i had read some of the reviews on here before purchasing .
negative	i have tried to communicate with customer_services at tripadvisor but all they seem to do is put your email on hold for 00_hours so that it looks_like they are doing something but they are really not .
positive	fantastic customer service , easy to use website , prompt and quick dispatch and delivery !
negative	purchased ajax tickets and was gutted to find out after spending money on flights and hotel to find the tickets were fake and lost a lot of money .!!!

negative	two_days after they were due to be delivered ( i . e .
positive	throughout this saga of my own making , they remained completely focused on giving me the bag i needed , the manager even emailing me on her weekend days off .
positive	i placed my order friday_afternoon and was amazed when a parcel arrived first thing saturday_morning .
neutral	which was very good .
neutral	and he was going to charge me for a regas too !
neutral	like the service , get a bit_worried_about them being the only provider of this solution on the web and any alternatives aren_'_t really supported get a bit frustrated at the charges and feeling trapped , but the service is ok and make buying stuff so much_easier .
neutral	luckily nothing was missing , but better packaging would make a huge_difference .
neutral	excellent , efficient delivery service , good packaging .
neutral	i suppose they have to make a mark up but that is going some !
neutral	after all there is a pop up offering accessories etc .
negative	well , i brought 0 lady_gaga tickets for stade de france in april of this year .

neutral	a major disappointment i am_afraid and not what we hoped it would be .
negative	i told_him to forget booking me back in and that i would just keep the specs and maybe take them out of the box in 0 - 0 years time when maybe then , my eyes might be slightly worse .
positive	i have found both the service and support from seiretto first_class .
positive	!

neutral	all through the day i received emails and the final one stated the parcel would be with me between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 that day .
neutral	an e_mail telling_me the replacement goods were on their way arrived the day after the goods were delivered .
positive	knowing that they are learning skills from them gives me added pleasure .
neutral	this was sorted very quickly but then about a week elapsed after the money was debited from my account before the item was sent for shipping .
negative	00th_november received text saying panel will be delivered tomorrow between 0000 and 0000hrs - do they assume we are just sitting at home waiting at their beck and call ?

positive	during the recent snowy_weather i suddenly realised that i needed a new snow shovel , i ordered it late one afternoon from tooled_- up and thirty - six hours_later i was using it to clear snow from my drive .
positive	this is the second year that i have booked with hotels direct , the first year was a hidden_gem and was more than pleased with the surprise of the hotel we got , this year i called them direct and asked if they could book us the same hotel and straight_away we had it booked , couldnt_fault the service , we got the le meridien in picadilly with full eat all you want and anything you want breakfast for half the cost the hotel would charge just for the room , very pleased and the customer service from hotels direct couldnt be_faulted

positive	great speedy service .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t rung myself to chase my order along the way i would not have had a clue what was happening .
neutral	some of the reatilers offer you good cashback and then dispute it and don_'_t pay it so it is a risk you take as this has happend to me 0 times with different vehicle insurance companies
negative	should be rather called " post sovjet adventure living ".
positive	instead of hanging about for the unknown time and day of delivery , both can be chosen by the regular information from the carrier .
neutral	the right_angled valves didn_'_t fit as the mounting_brackets for the radiator don_'_t project it far enough forward to allow enough space between the angled valves and the wall .
neutral	however , as a non tea drinker and someone for whom caffeine is a sure - fire way to a sleepless_night , i was very disappointed to only be offered one type of decaffeinated coffee .
positive	delivery slots have always been convenient and the delivery has always been within the time allotted .
positive	they are the only one i trust & would order nowhere_else .
negative	so used another company and it came the next_day !!
negative	she ask me to book her a flight to irleand she is in her 00s she flew out a day before she cam home she was told that her flight was delayed and to go to the airport which she did , the person she spoke to said if she wanted another flight it would cost her over a £_000_pounds which was a lot so it was a case of stay in the airport or pay
negative	i have always maintained , buy cheap pay twice and sadly that has_proved to be the case with this company
positive	efficient , friendly and eminently huggable !
positive	what more could we want ?
positive	after years of chopping and changing supermarkets finally finding one that does everything it says on the tin has_been difficult .
positive	cheap , prompt , and easy to buy from - not much else you want from a shop really .
positive	i live in spain and it is often complicated arranging payment and delivery of items to be sent here .
negative	formal_complaint to be lodged today , as 0 days_later still_waiting on my parcel to be collected cheers interparcel many_thanks !!!!!
positive	will definitely order from them again .
negative	little did i know .
neutral	but all went down_hill after that .
neutral	00kg in 00 boxes which i paid £_000 in courier fees and the driver refused to take 00 feet further to the lift and dropped them just inside the front_door , so whilst they met their obligations , by no means was it a good service .
negative	i had to cancel due to illness .
neutral	the order was sent to the wrong_address , the food was great value but delivered in white sacks so no idea is was what i ordered !
positive	i had been to a local_dealer who quoted me nearly_double the price for the same thing .
neutral	i '_ve also emaild the info emial adrress about the missing plug but i '_ve not heard_anything either .
negative	i have requested a refund on the next_day delivery fee , and am still_waiting on the 0rd chair / stool .
negative	i got to dover for the 0 . 00 p . m . ferry and was told that i had to pay £_000 . 00 extra as i was carrying goods ( not for commercial gain ) and that unless i paid it i could not travel .
positive	i have come to expect a high_standard of service from offtek .
neutral	( as i was in a hurry there would be no time to send irt back in order to get the right sizes .)
negative	we chose our food from the fair selection of food available and the met the worst till operator i have ever had the misfortune to come_across .
neutral	we ordered a wrist_support in the wrong_size and removed it from the sealed packet before realising .
negative	don_'_t risk it .
positive	great prices .
neutral	a couple of days_later , i got email from them saying the item was dispatched and was given an_hour_slot for delivery , which i could change if the time was not convenient .
negative	the actual products i ordered for my party were completely fine and arrived promptly .
negative	also when i ordered i chose to checkout as a guest , but they created an account for me anyway , showing total_disregard for my choice .
neutral	i feel so let_down by the very poor aftercare service in eastbourne and don_'_t want to travel to brighton for this .
neutral	that wasn_'_t very nice !!
neutral	would use again but maybe opt for a more premium bunch next time .
neutral	i hope this was just a one off
negative	we are an_hour from chester , direct on the a00 .
negative	after booking our trip to barcelona last night 00rd_july and was told because i have a recording that the baggage_allowance would be £ 0 . 00 or 00_euros_per 00 kilos ( 0 bag ) . only to find out this is wrong it will be £_00 . 00 per bag
positive	saved me hiring a van + fuel , insurance and time .
positive	i phoned up to check how the strings would be packaged and had a friendly chat with someone_who knew their ball ends from their phosphor bronzes .
negative	the delivery is part of the overall service that '_s why i would never recommend your company ; you chose the couriers so it was your choice .
negative	unfortunately when you order something you have no choice over the courier company used , but this makes the rabbit hutch company look very bad .
neutral	i know that if i '_d rang any of my local suppliers , i '_d have had the oil delivered in 0_days max .
neutral	i bought the variety pack but so far have only really enjoyed one of the blends .
negative	ordered a shirt from my son which arrived with the wrong number on , spoke to an advisor who promised me a new shirt would be printed the next_day & couriered overnight .
neutral	this got annoying when i was happy with how i had arranged the images and it shuffled them around again .
positive	there was a problem with the first book as some of the text i had requested was not printed in the book .
negative	the surprise now spoilt , she then had to go out and hunt_around the house to see if she could find them .
neutral	the tyre_fitter wouldn_'_t move a used tyre from front to back at the same time as he was fitting new tyres . he said he ' d have to charge me for that .
positive	delivered .
neutral	but everything is far too expensive .
positive	i would use them again
neutral	in fact it was 0 .
negative	this kicked them into action , and they immediately refunded my money along with the following message :
neutral	my lenses have arrived and on time but , in line with all other topcashback comments , i have yet to see if the credit will be added to my account .
neutral	i would use them again but not for something that i urgently require .
negative	i am_disgusted with the lack of any attempt to sort_out this problem , as they are still showing as in stock for 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	beware .
negative	but i am now reading about this happening a lot .
negative	like previous reviewers , i spent over 0 0 / 0 hrs on the phone today , mainly listening to music .
neutral	however , the products haven_'_t worked and my dogs still have fleas .
neutral	told std price given wiithout discount .
positive	what you say on your website is what you deliver .
negative	ordered a king mattress online .
negative	declined offer and said i would leave negative_feedback and was then asked to send a birdseye view of the flowers .
negative	ended_up having to collect from depot so seriously out if pocket !
negative	i have of course received an estimated bill reducing my credit by £_00 for a month i have not lived in the house .
positive	highly_recommend them , as i will definitely be using their service again .
neutral	this is the second time that the flowers have been left_outside .
negative	no attempt was made to explain what i should be doing to rearrange delivery and no apology was offered .
positive	truly liberated from the evil weed , liberty_flights has me hooked , but in a good way !
positive	it was delivered next_day in a well_packaged box .
negative	their beds are rubbish and customer service even worse .
negative	i know the car i purchased wasn_'_t a £_00k range_rover or jaguar ( it was only £ 0000 ) but surely every customer should be treated fairly .
negative	my item arrived faulty and was not refunded .
negative	ordered a bean_bag , with groupon_voucher , at the beginning of november , had many promises and excuses from infurn , but still no sign of the bean_bag , just a continually changing delivery date .
neutral	on booking we were told we would be given a ford_focus or similar so we were a bit surprised at the offer of a fiat_000 !
neutral	so if you find a product cheaper some where else , buy it .
neutral	the driver did not wait to see if the door was answered , leave with a neighbour or hide it behind an available large rose tub .
negative	we did this , then phoned air_france to check .
positive	i had paid for assembly ( and i '_m so glad i did ) and they guys put it together in about 00_mins .
negative	price is ok , but customer service is slow and near non - existant
positive	i was sent emails_confirming order with the option to edit details easily if required and informing_me of dispatch and delivery .
negative	!
positive	as i had used paypal i couldn_'_t suspend payment but instead wrote an e_- mail to dotty_hippo during the evening to try and change the item for the correct one .
neutral	may not use them again
neutral	delivery charges have always felt a little high , especially for one bottle .
neutral	so i called and was told that there was none left and they weren_'_t expecting any so will issue a refund .
positive	thank - you .
neutral	if something like that is possible , i ' d definitely use the site .
negative	apparently they came in a nice box but the ' deluxe ' bouquet i had paid_extra for consisted of 0 carnations , 0 or 0 antirrhinums and 0 stems with white berries on .
neutral	the first time i put it on the caravan and tightend the straps i ripped a strap away from its fastening .
negative	they arrived two_days late .
neutral	i renewed my travel_insurance on 0th_february and was promised thatthe renewal documents would be sent in the post .
neutral	i contacted the service desk and it took several days to resolve .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 this is the first item i sent with yodel , and what a total_failure it has_been , the live_chat on friday confirmed it would be , i cant_remember the name but it was a man
neutral	i have updated the review to three stars .
positive	they are not cheap but the quality is reliable so worth the investment .
neutral	obviously every_penny we spend comes out of the charity funds & so it is a shame when things arrive damaged .
negative	maybe their management should visit the us and find out what customer service really is .
positive	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
negative	awful customer service , buy your wine elsewhere .
positive	got great advice about my shower '_s particular fault , the guy at showerdoc seemed to know everything about my options to repair my shower including when asked about a replacement unit which shower would fit as a direct replacement i . e not having to alter plumbing etc , impressed .
positive	i say thanks mazuma .
positive	we are extremely pleased with our invitations & would recommend them to everyone
neutral	very good price but quality of product could be better
negative	at the very least he should say sorry we are closing .
positive	i was allowed to test the machines and run comparisons of stitches seeing how neat the lettering was and how precise the decorative stitches were .
negative	they were obviously stretched for time , had no interest in customer service , and simply wanted to get in and out as quickly as possible !
positive	we grind to a halt .
positive	why cans all firms be like this and free next_day delivery at the cheapest price around .
negative	i only use paypal as ebay won_'_t allow me to use anything_else !
neutral	we have only started_using paymentsense , and my impression so far is that their agents are quick and responsive .
neutral	i renewed my car insurance in january . just received the cash_back at the end of june .
negative	i am extremely angry .
negative	so as my phone fitted the criteria was confused why reduced by £_00 so called and spoke to a gentlemen at zoomfish who then stated i should read further down to subheading 0 . 0 which then states
positive	very fast delivery , thank_you
neutral	however it took a week from them confirming_receipt of my phone to the money being sent for payment .
negative	!
negative	plenty ?
positive	it '_s a 00st_century service with good old - fashioned and genuine customer_care at its core - a rare_thing .
negative	item was listed in stock .
negative	so , i waited in expecting to see the item sometime that day .
negative	telephone doesn_'_t get answered .
neutral	the flowers that were delivered weren_'_t as many as in the pictures .
neutral	this is the first time i have used bulk_powders , referred from men '_s health .
neutral	i said she would be there until 0pm but you said you would be able to deliver by 0 :_00pm which seemed fine .
positive	and in first_class condition .
positive	great service and price
negative	when i rang up to complain that i '_d wanted a replacement , they said i could order it from their web_site , but the price had tripled , so it was no_longer competitive .
negative	we would like to inform you that we will refund any charge made on your credit_card .
neutral	prices competitive and booking process otherwise ok so no reason not to use .
positive	excellent prices and very fast delivery .
negative	who we already knew had nothing to do with this !!
positive	they deliver quickly and it '_s always free_postage !
negative	each time i submitted a message i had to wait a long time for a response .
negative	another global monster who are happy taking your money but do not give customer service or care about the produce the peddle .
neutral	however , it took a long time for the product to be sent from the manufacturer to havens and during this time there was no update given .
positive	excellent service thoughout the process , garage very friendy and helpfull
negative	after 00_hours still no update on progress .
neutral	i got my order the next_day , which was great .
positive	ordered and delivered quick and efficient service and to top it all it was really cheap half the rrp .
neutral	!
negative	i received confirmation_email and the details about itinerary only after two_days .
positive	but they didn_'_t bother to tell me this .
positive	the next_day helen long called and we must have been in the phone for about half an_hour ( my fiancé and i only want to go to one specific island in the maldives ) which is why we were finding it so hard .
negative	currently trying to resolve matter with post_office resolutions , not a good service nor an expected outcome .
positive	cyclestore had best value with free_postage .
positive	since 0000 we have gone_through quite a few transformations and server companies both here in the us and in the uk .
neutral	i think the main problem is that i have read all the reviews and just cant trust them with more of my orders .
positive	brilliant news for sports car buffs , brilliant threads and opportunities to find out about whatever you need to and a real sense of community .
neutral	far more than i was expecting .
neutral	on the other , trying to get them to do work on the bike themselves is an_absolute chore .
neutral	i then realised after_placing the order that that was when it would be despatched .
positive	i ordered flowers for my mother '_s birthday and was fairly sure i ' d left it too late to get there on time .
negative	i paid in full in advance so was not best pleased .
negative	as far as is practically possible , i nowadays buy all computer equipment at better prices , from other_sources , because a visit to pcworld is a frustrating experience just about every time .
positive	i would highly_recomend this company and will_definately_use again .
positive	much_better_than_expected !
neutral	i ordered a toning belt paid postage no email to say gone_through so rang and was told had gone_through should be delivered next week .
neutral	otherwise , the service provided was a expected and we will probably use dollar again .
positive	in best price and remarkably quick in despatching it . despite the purchase price
neutral	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
positive	!
neutral	ps i have given away all the 0 packets of chicken cous_cous i couldn_'_t eat .
neutral	the actual flowers are beautiful and really look the part , however i would not use this company again .
positive	!
positive	whilst not_necessarily cheap , the service has_been easy , fast , and above all , the products have been first_class and supplied from a uk pharmacy .
neutral	whilst both lots of flowers have been stunning , each time i have had great difficulty using the amazon discount_code .
neutral	but as the next couple of days unravelled i found more items with same day delivery shelf_life .
positive	the company handled my order quickly with no_hassles , etc .
negative	i won_'_t buy from a company that doesn_'_t listen to it '_s customers , it '_s really not hard and is unacceptable from a company their size .
negative	this has happened to me before but i was willing to put it down to some sort of interupted internet_connection .
negative	i wanted it deliverd to the site i am working at the moment as my card is regesterd to my office over 00 miles_away .
positive	great service !!
positive	clear_instructions .
neutral	considering the price i struggle to understand_why they cannot supply thicker ply to give a more robust roof .
positive	quick simple service with no_problems , and at the right price .
positive	it was very easy and fast to fit .
negative	( he said that they would refund tea shirts !)
neutral	as clearly warned , it arrived on a pallet and really needs two people to safely take it off the pallet and transer it to the room where it is to be constructed .
negative	), they should not have charged for such a service .
negative	!
neutral	it was very frustrating , not to have my concern resolved .
neutral	it '_s important to send itemised receipts with deliveries --- cos your online confirmations don_'_t always agree with the quoted prices / offers stated at point of purchase .
positive	quality of goods was excellent , as was the choice .
neutral	the following_day i had still not heard back so i sent another email and the response was that the ericsson t00 was not in stock !!!!
positive	kept me updated by email regularly .
positive	my only issue is that you don_'_t seem to sell boxes of 00 lenses - or is this just my failure to find them .
positive	we ordered our rotating wooden see - saw and it was delivered to us promptly .
neutral	!
negative	i would rather walk than use you again ./ anyone reading this , i would say beware .
neutral	the display online looked fabulous and whilst the colour of the flowers were as_described , i was extremely disappointed not to have any lillies in the bouquet , especially as they dominated the picture and therefore ' expected ' them .
negative	would not recommend this company mainly for the customer service , the product could be better but if they had a decent product and customer service you make allowances .
neutral	they appear to be good quality and the delivery was very fast .
neutral	i bought this as a present however due to the opened packaging i kept it and bought them something_else .
negative	and then !
positive	the team were great - helping with quotations and suggesting products tailored to meet our needs .
negative	according to jason it has not even been picked yet , 0 working_days and it has not even been picked yet !!!
neutral	i know it '_s not worn often but , u are showing it off for that night , everyone looking at u , it needs to be better quality .
negative	e_mail and answer machine correspondence repeatedly went_unanswered .
positive	as always my vitamins arrived within two_days .
positive	delivery was prompt and the 0 hour time_slot very helpful if a little on the early side !
positive	the quality of the products , recommended by my nutritionist , along with the informative website and the option of getting a discount on all orders , for a one - off annual payment , as well as the instant despatch of orders makes this a really good company with which to deal .
negative	the marketing emails which then followed were absolutely_dreadful as they came in a few at a time and then continued for days and days and days .
positive	i was pleased with ( most !)
neutral	i ordered believing the item to be in stock but after it failed to arrive , several days after the advertised delivery date , i phoned to be advised that the item was a special order and would take longer .
positive	the blinds arrived quickly and we ' re easy to put up .
positive	they brought it into the room i required and were very polite guys .
negative	it happened again and this time after shutting the phone down , it wouldn_'_t restart .
positive	we are loving our new furniture and when we can_afford the sideboard we will be back .
neutral	as above .
positive	of my pictures from the weekend .
positive	i ordered the kingston leather bag and i '_m so pleased with it .
positive	can '_t ask for anything more than that .
negative	loving all the fake 0 * reviews by people who only have ever written this one amazing review .
negative	i am beyond exasperated with iflorist .
neutral	their price was much_better_than companies quoted me directly .
negative	in fairness to via gogo a full_refund as been payed thank_you now 00 . 00 . 00
neutral	the staff_member was polite and helpful , no_complaints there .
negative	i rang up and had this confirmed by a member of staff .
positive	the salespeople in store were pleasant & not at all pushy , they allowed_us to browse at our leisure & when we were ready to ask for assistance they were attentive & knowledgable .
negative	i '_m a regular customer at photobox and after this recent_purchase i will still be a regular customer to photobox .
negative	rang again and told yet again 00 days .
neutral	i must_say that i choose the free delivery option ( 0 to 0 days ), but my order was made over a week_ago and have still not arrived after two_weeks . not had a text to say when my delivery will be made either .
negative	would you not phone the client if you never received a response . very poor !!
neutral	when i eventually got hold of them having left messages .
negative	so here we are friday_afternoon and i ’_m still_waiting to see if my table is going to be picked_up in just0 days ’ time as i have to arrange somebody to sit at home all day whilst they come … and weather the new table will be delivered on the same day !.
neutral	yes , it was an arrangement of fresh flowers and was delivered on time , but it was not what i ordered !
neutral	also they have lowered their hand_luggage_allowance to 00kg and charge a whopping 00_quid for a 00_kg back for check in .
neutral	always use goodp [ rint but they have cut these strangely and so they don_'_t look right .
neutral	honour leggings are way to big .
neutral	could have been a genuine reason for this but we didn_'_t see any other tourist buses in front or behind us , so not sure what that was about .
neutral	please try harder
negative	i have been bombarded by non sense letters asking to pay bill of an address that i have never lived at neither i have even been to such place .
positive	also you can build up a portfolio by getting recommendations from your pupils .
negative	they claim no order for the name or address was ever processed .
neutral	delivery was great and on time by a good guy .
neutral	a simple sketch on the printout would have made things much clearer .
negative	i ordered a christmas_gift_card on the 0th of december .
negative	the customer service team have been very slow to respond to date and i will not use this company again .
neutral	however , although we were told where to meet the operator upon our return , signs to the relevant car_park at stanstead were not good , and we were waiting in the wrong place .
negative	all change .
negative	okay these things_happen but it has taken them 0 months to admit it and now they don_'_t want to take_responsibility .
negative	i called and told them i would be reporting them to trading_standards .
neutral	i would understand if it happens once or twice but this is annoying as i almost expect it now every time i order .
positive	i was searching online for a slate door number for my house and found atlantic_signs who are based in cornwall .
negative	i had decided to try a different supplier to interflora , but will never use this company again .
negative	!
negative	update_: parcel turned_up 0 months later !
negative	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
neutral	so animed please consider_using another company with people who are customer_focused like yourselves .
neutral	was okay but probable wont use again , some of the flowers were broken and turning_brown and not worth the money , thought it was going to be bigger but pretty disappointed to be honest !
negative	i spoke with over 0 different people and all of them were unhelpful and borderline rude .
negative	i am £_000 out of pocket with no hope of making a claim .
positive	they had the lamps i wanted and they were easy to do_business with
negative	!
negative	i am so cross !
negative	it was not so much about the 000g of chicken it was more in regards to the way it has_been handled , i would have spent close to £_000 a month -> £ 0000 a year on chicken through musclefood . com and they waved it off for the sake of £ 0 in chicken value .
neutral	a second set of instructions is included with the screws , which shows the correct ' l '- shaped posts but shows the screws being placed differently from in the first set of instructions .
negative	the flowers finally arrived past 0pm and we stayed in all day waiting for them .
negative	i had to get a family_member braver than i to shout down the phone at them to send an engineer out .
negative	finally i have had to make a new booking through another agency .
neutral	overall though i received the codes i bought and they worked so ive no_complaints there but i would hope this company will look into other ways to verify users without having to share confidential information .
positive	0_stars .
neutral	you get e_-_mails saying that the items are not in stock , then you try again and they are .
positive	excellent service from bulkpowders .
negative	terrible company , totally_useless !
positive	more than happy with the way it was explained to me and the lady had excellent telephon manner thank_you kathleen coulton
positive	rosemary kaye
negative	i could type a lot about this company but don_'_t have time , all i will say is :
neutral	it arrived on thursday - which is still good , but it makes a mockery of " next_day delivery "
positive	i had laser_eye treatment , it is such a difference being_able to see so clear .
neutral	the men were grumpy and unhelpful and i have made a formal_complaint about them .
negative	i would much rather have spent an extra £_00 and bought from a reputable_company .
negative	supposingly delivered but person signed it reception and at wrong post_code so parcel never given to the owner no idea were it gone to
neutral	when i tried to amend this through my account , the website kept_crashing and wasn_'_t showing my booking . very frustrating :(
neutral	during this time i had to make a lot of phone_calls to spain , i '_m from romania , in order to understand what was the status of my order , i would like to add that i was not informed about any_problems before i made the calls .
neutral	i wasn_'_t impressed with blue_chip holiday '_s booking procedures .
negative	with only one posting day left before christmas .
negative	i ordered a jacket from their website on a sunday , they said it would arrive with me on the following friday in time for my camping_trip .
positive	purchased full verical blind for patio_doors and separate slats to replace old ones .
positive	all the speakers i wanted were in stock in the finish i wanted .
neutral	i am sure some people just give up .
negative	they have started to overcharge us by £_00 a month .
neutral	and , then the click and position upright mechanism to convert to a sofa stopped_working .
positive	well_packaged .
negative	web_site statement
neutral	the flowers were delivered between 0 . 00am - 0 . 00am when the recipient was in and available to receive them however the joy of surprise was denied her because the flowers were simply left at the front of her property , open to being taken by anyone passing .
positive	each one has_been promptly dealt_with and they do a great job of picking out exactly the card i need .
neutral	although i haven_'_t tried any of the meat yet i was impressed with the delivery information i received via_email , and the fact that it arrived on time .
neutral	but at_least , were it explained_clearly , it would be caveat_emptor , and nothing to complain_about .
positive	i cant say ive noticed better toned legs etc but they are so comfy and i wear them all day !
positive	couldn_'_t be better .
positive	pleased with how they dealt_with the situation and will_continue to use them .
neutral	it would be beneficial for busuu and it '_s users to concentrate on tackling the grammar issues to improve it '_s service .
negative	i ( stupidly ) sent my 00gb iphone_0s to this " company " to repair a stiff power_button .
positive	i have needed to send parcels and luggage ahead on several_times and would recommend them to you as i have to friends previously .
neutral	i was a bit puzzled as to why it would take so long for them to pick them up ( and a bit annoyed to have to store them for so long ) but customer_services were very helpful .
positive	the next_day delivery is very welcome .
negative	do not use this company .
positive	i have even phoned for advise and found the help i received very professional , helpful and polite .
negative	constant ads , a snooty pop up yelling at me to turn off ad blocker , picture jumping all over the place , spontaneously rewinds , spontaneously throws in more ads in the middle of a scene then jumps back - horrible !
negative	the clinician advised us that ' yes this would get paid back up to 00hrs before the surgery '.
negative	the flowers should have been delivered on either saturday or sunday , as specified when choosing the option " mothers_day weekend ".
neutral	i am a frequent internet shopper and the best traders that i buy from , ensure that their goods arrive within 00 - 00_hours , which meant wednesday at the latest .
positive	with the buy one get one free offer i was able to get her two different fasionable pairs of glasses to match different outfits so she '_s even happier , result !!!
neutral	it arrived next_day when we were out .
positive	looked at your web_site one day and found they were one of the best prices , fairly easy to do and found next_day in the post their return envelope .
neutral	i '_ve still not received an apologie for their mistake .
negative	if i have an issue i should take it up with there courier they don_'_t want to know and have said they want there £_000 .
neutral	we are very happy with the product and if we had of been here the first time the van called it would have been a quick delivery .
neutral	i used to sell the odd thing on ebay , but unless i list it as collection only , i usually end up out of pocket on postage , as ebay dictate the postage you can charge .
negative	very disappointing .
neutral	update .
neutral	having got up early on saturday cleared the old_appliance outside and waited at 00 . 00 another phone_call to be told there were issues with the van yesterday and the driver would be phoned and i would be phoned back .
positive	the pen i ordered was faulty and they acted promptly and efficiently to sort_out the issue .
positive	then just click and you ' re booked .
positive	delivery is always on time and the product has always been as requested .
positive	its a brilliant boredom killer .
positive	mats are good quality , look good and fit well .
negative	i thought the titan 0 was a new product but i can '_t get the parts for it and it '_s only been out a couple of months .
negative	so i phoned for that appointment - only to be told that they will in fact not make one without a referral from our gp .
positive	the purchase was easy & the process of ordering easy , prompted at all_stages .
neutral	also the drivers seat now doesn_'_t click into position without a great push or it frightens some poor learner to death when it suddenly bangs into place at some in - opportune moment !!
negative	now i take it to facebook .
positive	everything was so simple to get what you need and it was delivered when i was told it would be
negative	we chased them once a week for a follow_up for 0_weeks as each time they promised an update in 0 days time , but and then complete silence .
positive	i have already_recommended to a friend and will_continue to do so !
neutral	the only problem was two christmas puddings containers cracked and seal was broken during shipment .
neutral	strap and toe clip on pedals
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	good luck with telephone_calls sounds_like half the guys have just got out of bed .
neutral	i would suggest that you get a map and try and see as much during the day as possible .
negative	i have no_intention to wasted my days waiting for parcel_force .
negative	it may not seem a massive amount but to me as a skint student it is a lot .
neutral	very disappointed has may have to remove tree if council complain
neutral	very surprised that this should have been the case as its unusual to buy something in the uk with a european_plug on .
positive	have received my second order from indigo_herbs .
neutral	we were initially very disaponted with the facilities of the villa compared to others booked through other_companies .

negative	so i rang the next_morning , and still spent 00_minutes on hold .
neutral	however , when i added items to my basket when ordering , i would expect to see at this point whether items were " out of stock ", i would then choose something_else .

neutral	anyway two_weeks after ordering 0 items arrived although i didn_'_t need them as i had to go get the items from elsewhere .
neutral	web_site was not quite the ticket and the person supposedly in charge of it could have been more on the ball .
neutral	when delivered bit disappointed with size of bunch could have been me thinking original picture was bigger , ordered balloon which did not arrive so spoilt surprise a bit , but was refunded on balloon
neutral	they did not keep in contact to say they were waiting on the product coming in .

neutral	not what i expected of the new i phone 0 !!
neutral	overall , the bouquet ( beautiful smile de_luxe ) was pleasing , although a little_disappointing that there were not as many white_roses as expected , and not sure what extra benefit was derived from a " de_luxe " version .
neutral	the gent i spoke to re this immediately asked if i wanted to cancel my order .
negative	then said the packaging was not right .
negative	indeed having checked my emails after 0 i was delighted to find delivery scheduled for 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 .

negative	once again , please_accept our apologies for the inconvenience or frustration that has_been caused on this occasion .
positive	easy site to order from , delivery within the week and even a couple of extra thrown in .
neutral	i had expected the padding to take away all feeling of the springs .
positive	my only very slight gripe is that it would have been nice to have some instructions and spec details to cover things like timer function , bulb replacement etc - the lights the only_thing in the box .
negative	sorry millets , i am unlikely to shop at millets again because i don_’_t use shops that have refund hassles .
negative	now they said they wont send it back because i am not the owner !
neutral	the other reason i am not giving any higher than 0_stars is because of their customer service .
positive	very easy website to use , all tyres prices appear to be heavily_discounted , your local_national_tyre_centre fits them ( my fitting_centre staff are so helpful and cheerful ).

positive	i ordered it on the weekend and it came 0 business days_later .
negative	i knew i could be liable for early cancellation_fees but my experience to date had so sincerely stressed me , not getting through to anyone who seemed to be able to at_least appear to know what needed doing as a next step , and to do it .
negative	welldone perfume shop ( owned by superdrug ) as i won_'_t be using your site again may be it about time you pick_up phone and speak with your customer than relying too much on your systems !
positive	may have a professional comedian in training .
negative	you think that by paying a deposit there is more of a guarantee that the courier will show up and that if they don_'_t then you should be able to get your money back .
positive	was kept up to date on order progress both by email and text .
neutral	my only_criticism is that the unit came in two pieces and very well_packed in big boxes and plenty of packing .
negative	while i was on the phone with them , the deal done !
negative	they can put it down in an advert , but they ' re not interested enough to listen when something_goes_wrong , and to honestly endeavour to sort it out .
negative	the rrp on the precious_little_ones site is misleading and a downright cheat to make you believe you ' re getting more for your money .
neutral	my order was logged as been received at 00 : 00 pm on saturday .
negative	i '_m_sure the lights worked properly before i entered the garage , and i had to adjust the handbrake when i came back home because it was very tight ( this year didn_’_t have any problem with it ).

positive	i sold 0 phones .
neutral	).
positive	highly_reccomended !!!!!
negative	i even spoke to them before the weekend but they said rest_assured they will arrive in time .
negative	items are shown as in stock when they are not and unlikely to be at all from what i gather .
neutral	also , even_though the room was quite adequate , bathroom spacious , being below street level takes any ambiance off the stay .
neutral	not a good experience as ordered and then was told could not get the bonus offer of free vouchers !
negative	do not use and do not trust .
neutral	and if possible a tracking_number . nothing , no email , no advisory .

negative	mp0_player as gift - so cheap and its worthless - better not give gifts !
neutral	you enquire regarding our recent order .
negative	after_speaking to another policy - parroting zombie i was handed to a manager who first attempted to fob me off with the same nonsense about policy and then tried to suggest that it was there to prevent ticket fraud .

neutral	i '_ve been an orange customer for years - i '_ve had all_sorts of problems from niggles with rude customer service to being_overcharged by £_000 .
neutral	maybe if i were a more anal person i would be concerned_about my tv bracket being a couple of days late .
negative	i placed an online order on 0 december , trusting the online statement of " free 0 day delivery ". this is not the case . and is totally misleading .

neutral	they were polite and quick though and came when they said they would so 0_* on that one thank_you .
positive	all in all a good experience .
positive	well_done morrisons , keep_up the great work .
negative	also what you said to the other person_who gave you 0_star " we are in the enviable position of not having to chose to deal with every customer who comes to our site ."
neutral	the day of the treatment was good but within a few_days i was in a lot of pain .
negative	i then cancelled my direct_debit as i cant trust how much they will take , so they now charge me more each_month as i will only pay manually - i had asked for my bill to be re issued without this set_up fee and they kept getting in incorrect .
negative	would i use them again ?
neutral	however , when trying to fit pole , it was very loose in the middle on the join .
positive	so the british_corner_shop is a great service , prompt and efficient .
positive	have used mazuma several_times for cheap and expensive phones .
neutral	the customer_services is rubbish because when i notified them they sent me a ' standard response ' email which indicates they had not read my email properly and it also indicates they are used to complaints .
positive	the site offers really good deals and we really like the full / full option on the fuel .
positive	i have been using strings_direct for many_years .
negative	in the end after another call asked for my money back , i have learnt never to use this company again i have purchased many items from other_companies and had had not problems .

neutral	they were very similar to a small £ 0 bunch from a supermarket .
positive	would definitely ( actually have ) recommend to a friend
positive	would recommend this site to anyone at my golf_club .
negative	delivery costs far too much , esp when it takes a week to get here , i live in a main city not out in the country or anything like that so i have no idea why it takes so long .
neutral	many of my customers are not happy to do this , so may have to look at dropping trust_pilot as a preferred review site .
neutral	previously when i have not paid for my express delivery and just checked standard delivery it has arrived quicker_than the express delivery , therefore i would appreciate a refund on my delivery charge .
negative	to bad , and i would recommend everybody to think_twice before buying from them , if you don_'_t want to take the risk for getting problems if there is something wrong with the order
negative	when i explained to her that this was not the case as my friend had checked she didn_'_t know what to say .
positive	very satisfied with the service .
negative	the car was either broken down on our drive or gathering_dust on their plot whilst a bunch of ignorant , arrogant , sales staff and technicians scratched their heads .
positive	the thing that amazed me was that chemical replied to my email during the weekend , i forgot to add one item to the order , they added it themselves and just charged my card a different sum , this saved me a lot of hassle !
positive	he is absolutely fantastic !!
negative	the only_thing that keeps me going back is the price .
positive	tuesday_morning i checked the tracking_number to find the parcel was in my area and out for delivery . i thought , great . around 0 :_00pm knock at the door . it '_s here problem free .
neutral	my credit_card was charged_twice so i phone simply_supplements who disputed this so had to call my credit_card company and then write to them enclosing a copy of my credit_card statement , they then agreed to credit the overcharge .
neutral	we were disappointed not to see our rep 0 or 0 days into our stay and had to phone to get answers to our questions ; such as the best places to shop and beaches to visit etc .
neutral	considering the low_prices paid for your cds this site is very ' choosy ' about what titles it will accept from you .
neutral	in fairness , the ts_&_cs state that orders may take up to 0 days to dispatch , but this is slow in this day .
positive	under promise and over deliver .
positive	payment was transferred to my bank same day mazuma received my phone .
neutral	i have come_across a few glitches but the main one has to be " paypal ".
neutral	however this time couple of hiccups .
positive	mr & mrs skoniecki .
neutral	ordered a costume large sizing to fit my entertainer but when it arrived the costume was all sized wrong the chest was tight and legs short and around bum area so tight so i had to return paying postage i explained that i thought the manufacturer had cut and sewed garment incorrectly for the large label regulations jokers said they had measured chest of return item and it would have fit a 00 " chest so then i queried did they manage to measurer legs etc they replied that all measurements had been done and since then the returned item i had sent back had been sold with no_problems with sizing and now they couldn_'_t measurer anymore of these costumes because they are out of stock which i think is particular strange maybe they have realised that the costume has_been cut and sewed incorrectly to manufacturers regulations for large measurements and removed from sale .
negative	numbergroup '_s t &_cs say that " at_least thirty ( 00 ) days notice will be given prior to suspension for non - payment " but in my case they cut_off my business lines on february_00th after one ( 0 ) days notice for a bill that had been due for payment ( they allege ) within 00 days of february 0st ( previous invoices had allowed 00 days to pay ).
positive	top_marks .
negative	shocking service - flowers arrived 0_days after dispatch - totally dead .
negative	it '_s true that their terms and conditions say they can keep your things until you paid , but that doesn_'_t mean you have to pay any amount they ask for in addition to what was quoted .
positive	recommended
neutral	although very easy to order and super quick delivery - we were extremely unhappy with delivery service and some aspects of the order .
neutral	it took well over a week after sending the items for them to be received and the cash to come through , the service was good but i doubt i would use the service again .
negative	i received a " large " bouquet through the post for my birthday from my husband .

negative	ordered a rain_cover when purchasing hauck turbo pushchair , the one received was not as illustrated and is a very poor fit . my daughter gets wet when it rains !!
neutral	items collected had been left out in the rain with the consequence that we had a soaking_wet boot in the car .
neutral	the bed is fine and was fairly easy to put_together , though i advise a second_pair of hands to steady pieces while the screws are inserted in the holes .
neutral	i now in the process of renewing my home insurance again and have no_intention of purchasing it through_topcashback .
neutral	a recent telephone order was sent to the wrong_address in_spite of telling the operator the correct details .

positive	top quality and good service .
neutral	i ordered cardboard_cutout of harry from one direction for my niece .

negative	it '_s honestly beyond_belief .
positive	thank_you , osmo .
neutral	the roman_blind arrived in time for christmas so we were thrilled about that , the quality is very good and it was very easy to put up , the only_downside is when putting the blind down it '_s really fiddly with the pull_cord especially as there is not much space in the corner of our room and as you need to be able to reach right up to nearly the top of the cord to let it down , the blind we '_d bought previously for our bedroom has a roller chain which is so much_easier , so sadly we '_ll definitely be fiitng the rest of the house with the the chain versions .
neutral	the website was easy to navigate and the booking quick to make .
neutral	i ordered on friday , product dispatched on monday and goods only arrived on thursday !
positive	the eyedrops were ordered in the evening , they were with us , not the next_morning but the morning after that .

positive	we have now received the wedding_invites , reply cards & name place cards and are very pleased with them .
positive	i made a quick call to the agent to check delivery and was seen to immediately on arrival .
negative	the call_centre when i did manage to speak to them briefly just fobbed me off and gave_me the van_drivers mobile number , now i guess its just because he wanted to go home , but the van_driver wont answer his ruddy phone , so they will be getting an earful on the phone first thing in the morning until something has happened .
negative	their website offers next_day delivery - it took weeks and when the cartridges arrived they were useless .
neutral	unfortunately the flowers the flowers did not look like they had been arranged and did not come in the bouquet style or finishing as in the picture .
neutral	however , there are no previews on save the date or thank_you cards .
positive	i also needed them turned around quickly as they were specifically for work .
neutral	i '_ve just tried the first 0 of the 00 pack of 0oz mature rump_steaks i had delivered last_week by westin_gourmet .

positive	yours_faithfully
negative	my order was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn_'_t bother .
neutral	last_year i would have given five_stars without_hesitation .
neutral	the food is superb and not to be_faulted but the company is let_down by an un - reliable delivery partner .
neutral	katy - incredibly helpful and understanding )!
neutral	the phone i gave mm was a nokia_e00 in " good " condition , but not " good " condition that i ' d feel_comfortable selling to someone i knew .

positive	so simple , so easy .
negative	poor_excuse for a company !
positive	i used national showers spares before and was impressed with efficiency and ease of use for the website , followed_by prompt delivery .
negative	the recipient received them damaged and whilted .
negative	i expect this update to be ignored as well .
negative	i argued them down in price instead and eventually got the deal i was happy with and ( stupidly ) accepted .
positive	i wish that i had found animed earlier - easy to use , reasonable and efficient .
negative	it seems that <_external link_removed_> no_longer has a web presence / phone number / customer service / returns address .

neutral	i have no idea when they arrived and we have had heavy_snow and they are quite sodden .
negative	they hadn_'_t even bothered to come to my front_door and i was sat in the front room at the time .
neutral	i will say the delivery system they use is brilliant .
positive	just * brilliant *.
positive	we '_ve bought two blinds ( so_far ) that more than met our expectations , add the excellent delivery service and clear fitting_instructions and together they add up to a supplier deserving of praise .
neutral	the childs seat we were given was dirty and very difficult to fit correctly to the seat .
neutral	i chucked them and ordered from a same day florist .
neutral	recently_purchased a guitar_amp from these_guys .
neutral	having been given a delivery date , i waited in all day but my item never turned_up .
negative	jo the customer service agent couldn_'_t email me the instructions i now have to wait for them to be posted !
positive	easy ordering , and very quick delivery as promised .
positive	all i can say is give sportsbikeshop a visit and i don_'_t think you '_ll be disappointed either !
positive	item was dispatched quickly and excellent communication .
neutral	this meant i was going to have to pay £_00 . 00 + 00 . 00 + 0 . 00 = £_00 . 00 rather expensive seal . i sent an_email the support email address and they said this was wrong and it should on be about £ 0 . 00 to send back .
negative	i felt_like yodelling someone !
negative	i would dearly like to know the real motives .
neutral	tracking facilities are standard and good .

negative	i '_ve placed more than 000 orders with them in the past 0 years , but am so disgusted with their empty_promises to address a simple injustice that i '_m now done with them .
positive	only bought one item but it was delivered with no_fuss .
positive	not cheap but worth the investment .
positive	not physically being there poses a whole_host of problems but the staff at steven_james guitar & amp could not have done enough to answer all of my questions and arrange for delivery of what is now my favourite guitar !!
positive	really happy with the purchase
negative	there was mastic all over the bricks around windows it looked like he had removed the nozzle from the gun and spread it around with a trowel .
negative	feeling helpless , i called fedex trying to sort this out , i was told that uk custom suspects this company is providing false_information to escape paying tax , fedex would need me to provide an invoice for the purchase before they can release the package .
positive	it was very easy to look for and purchase the dress .
neutral	).

negative	i also knew there was a tiny_scratch on the camera but nothing considerable , i have taken many great photos without this affecting it .
positive	cheers .
negative	the dr - 0000 can print up to 00 , 000 pages .'
negative	when i said that if they had responded when i sent the email on saturday then this could have been prevented , they said no one worked on complaints at the weekend hence no response - well if they had set an out of office on their emails i would have know when to expect a response and waited instead of wasting £_00 - so not happy and would not recommend to a friend as i had waited a week in the first_instance as they had not stock and delivery was supposed to be within 0_days !
positive	well_done x
neutral	this has tainted my experience using ts and will probably not use them again unless they add another garage local to myself .
positive	we fancied a next_day trip to the isle of wight .
neutral	a day or so later i had notification of the delivery date , and it arrived as promised .
negative	when i bought my fence 0_months_ago , my review read that delivery was excellent and product was good .
negative	0 am and 0 pm .
negative	so i bought the fabric - they sell on at a profit .
negative	was not worth the money , and has put me of ordering again :(
negative	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail from gumtree saying this guy was a suspected fraudster so don_'_t take this further .

neutral	i have contacted your company regarding this matter to ask a few questions a week_ago , and still_waiting for an answer .
negative	= very angry !!!!!!!!!
negative	so the system can tell you that the engineer can '_t come but you can '_t let_me know ?
negative	yes this item was available on a pre order status apart_from 0 in stock in a size large and this is what i ordered .
neutral	to aussie wow
negative	funniest thing is , the offer was a limit of 0 per customer , however i '_ve been charged_twice . and have nothing to show for it , accept a lower balance on my account .
negative	they are in breach of contract
neutral	i was delighted to find an easy - to - heat ( and eat ) product that was free from common allergens , however i was a little disappointed with the taste .
negative	we had no gas supply to the house , i asked flo - gas to address the situation .
negative	the alternative_accommodation offers in edinburgh and ayr are a joke .
negative	gadgets and devices
negative	so i emailed wowcher and the advised that i needed to contact the supplier ' chimp electronics ' so i emailed the seller about the faulty pair .
positive	plus having the tracking on my parcel made it easier .
negative	driver unlocked backgate and left item outside on windowsill .
neutral	i cannot send a review as , solicitor not visiting until next monday .
neutral	it takes longer_than the alternative routes , but is far cheaper
positive	sizing is spot_on .
positive	brilliant choice of high_quality chocolate on an easy to use site .
negative	the whole website has to be revamped .
neutral	0 . try not to employ morons who are allowed to be customer facing .
negative	so it was cheaper_than else where but the packing sorely let them down .
positive	it fits a treat and works much_better_than the old one !
positive	i always seem to get a consistent result with this site , easy clear to understand
neutral	very easy to order from , however the stock_levels are not kept up to date enough and if your item goes out of stock , you may have to wait over 0_weeks to get your order .
positive	i have used this company three_times and i have been very happy with the carpet and the service .
positive	we never realised there was a company sending flowers that had so much class .
neutral	i bought my wife some flowers for a special day of ours , same day delivery splashed all over the blurb , i didn_'_t go for the more_expensive ones i wanted which looked amazing as they said next_day , but they weren_'_t delivered the same day she got them 00_hours after i wanted her to have them .
neutral	the blinds were absolutely fine for the job they were bought for and i would have no_hesitation in recommending the blind as ' value for money ' and people always tend to have a few spare skrews around in their garage .
neutral	the package could have been stolen very easily .
positive	i posted my phone at my local post_office on wednesday , had a e_- mail from mazuma on thursday_morning and the money was in my bank_account before i ' d finished work the very same day , i was totally godsmacked by the fantastic service , couldn_'_t praise them enough ,
positive	this website is wonderful , it have the medication that we need for our dogs at a much_cheaper price .
positive	the shoes were a good price and they were delivered quickly .
neutral	the other pots had had labels taken off because there was still part of the label showing .

neutral	a new one on me from any on - line supplier .
positive	i have been using allbeauty now for around 0 years and i cant_believe_how much_cheaper perfume is compared to boots , superdrug etc .
negative	i receieved my shower and called my plumber out to fit it , only to find i had the wrong one , i emailed bella bathroom to see if i could send it back to them - they said no , as i had recieved it 0_days ago , and that they only refund on goods that are received within 0_days !
negative	it cannot be this hard to get someone to help me ?
negative	i would not recommend them at all
negative	what '_s that statistic - one dissatisfied customer tells at_least 00 others ?
neutral	certainly doesn_'_t have the feel of a new item i could have gifted a pre_- owned bracelet that way .
positive	found the best energy prices with clear_concise information .
neutral	its great to able to find the items i like at a better_than high_street price .
positive	easy to use sight and always manage to get a good price < one very happy customer .
positive	cats and i were surprised but delighted .
positive	coffee sometimes loses its milk . due to high number of customers .
positive	over the moon with my order all fresh & delicious .
negative	phoned me 0 days_later to tell me it was out of stock and it would be at_least another 0 days before i received it .
positive	i would definitely recommend envirofone above any other mobile phone exchange service
negative	avoid yodel and parcels to go at all costs .
neutral	if we hadn_'_t have remembered the route we took on arrival we might still be there now !
positive	a strait_forward internet company . no_frills easy to select the product you want . very good value and large_selection of goods .
negative	awful to deal with , never again .
negative	unable to contact them .
negative	it took three tries for them to send the correct order , each time with long delays .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have bought online if there were a local tailor .
negative	i ordered a pair of headphones on 00 / 00 / 00 , delivery 0 - 0 working_days .
neutral	they insisted we were there so we had to take time off work and dash home to sign for the item .
positive	couldn_'_t fault it .
neutral	however , i had to badger by email to get a satisfactory response to a failed component .
neutral	i used this service for the first time today for 0 parcels and it was very easy to do but if i decide to use them again i would not go back to the turbary wine shop in ferndown to drop them off .
positive	excellent service , professional job - very happy customer
neutral	he went on to say that the florist would not be open until saturday but would be delivered then .
neutral	given ziffit and music_magpie can pay via_bacs i see this as a weekness in the zapper propostition
positive	they find a variety of pupils which is fun .
positive	i have brought so many items and every time i recieve them they are wonderful and really up to all the expectations - i have given the items as presents and used them in work shops they are really wonderful - thank_you - i have never been dissapointed .
neutral	then a final letter in my returned glasses anonymously thanking_me for ordering my new_specs and hoping i would be pleased with them and assuring_me of their 000_% commitment to customer service .
neutral	i ordered with express delivery which cost over_£ 0 but my parcel took several days to arrive .
negative	i expect to hear from you with my refund by end of business tomorrow as i have paid for a service i have not received !
neutral	take no notice of me though .
neutral	small plastic part was 0th of price of whole fridge .
negative	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they '_ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
negative	a couple of days_later i checked my bank_account and noticed that they had taken the payment .
neutral	then you find your email bombarded with requests of reviews , surveys , product suggestions .
negative	this renders trustpilot completely pointless .
negative	as a first time user of selectspecs and having read such positive_reviews , i was very much looking_forward to receiving my varifocals , fitted to frames i had sent in .
negative	it does not reflect well on you !
neutral	last time you sent it to the wrong_address and caused a great nuisance to my neighbours in getting it back before you would send it to the correct address .
positive	i am really pleased with my pictures and frames .
positive	i have placed 0 orders now with partyrama and both experiences have been fine .
positive	have purchased the same products a number of times .
positive	super_fast delivery , upgraded for free .
negative	would not recommend , service appalling received less money but this was not the issue no warning of this was .
positive	placed orders with others and upon renewing order the price has suddenly gone up !
positive	highly_recommend .
neutral	i also praised the company for the ease of ordering and the easy to navigate web_site but as they were so upset at the use of course language ( 0 b word ) they complained and had the post removed .
neutral	however , once my item was back in , delivery was the next_day so all ended ok even_though i ordered on a sat and received the following thursday .
neutral	i missed that soda very much , i '_m quite addicted .
negative	not worth your time let_alone your money , unless ofcourse you really like watching really old movies that no - one has ever heard of .
neutral	i would have no_problems using the scottish_kilt company again .
negative	the delivery man made no attempt to knock on our door - we were in - and to make his getaway as swiftly as he possibly could the idiot put the parcel in our green dustbin which was at the front of our property .
negative	we therefore offer you the revised price below for your phone .'
neutral	was told on each_occasion that it would be about 00_mins to wait , took between 00 & 00 , ok if its nice weather , will use them again though as they are reasonably_priced
negative	i got a standard your delivery has_been allocated message_stating 00th_march delivery .
negative	told to look online to see when available .
positive	all well_done .
neutral	and enterprise have received £_00 . 00 for absolutely zilch !!
positive	i ordered a barbour_jacket , which was too small .
positive	why_bother ?
positive	however the speed and efficiency of service has_been faultless over the last 0 years and i would not_hesitate in recommending them .
neutral	contacted company , but they weren_'_t really interested .
negative	com and the reason they can ' buy any car ' is that they offered me about a third of their market value ( a third of what i then sold them for privately ).
neutral	eg against a coin .
negative	øv !
negative	your comments here demonstrate it , and i find it an interesting diversion to observe how your responses and claimed the world it out to get you and how good you are on other forums etc ( i googled you and these reviews on trustpilot are actually your best ones !)
positive	no_problems with purchase and would use this service again .
positive	flights paid for now just need insurance .

neutral	draw from that what you will .
neutral	nice one !
positive	i found the bike i wanted on wiggle and it was £_00 cheaper_than competitors .
negative	to my shame , i accepted his offer , giving him my word that i would delete the review upon_receipt of the goods .
neutral	luckily i wasn_'_t in a massive rush
neutral	it was a great suit my son_loves it the only_thing was it had a hole in the seam of the glove i would say cheaply_made should be better quality for price
positive	ordered a small acer tree as a present for my mother '_s birthday .
negative	i '_m off after yet another failed collection .
neutral	i , eventually bought the drill from axminster_tools .
positive	i play many games on here and it is easy to get in touch with friends
negative	what booking exactly ?!

positive	my daughter found her costume on line , i rang placed ordered with very friendly and helpful assistant .
neutral	i needed 0 red rugs so decided to order my smallest_size first to ensure i was happy with them .
neutral	even_though its a few_years old now , its my lifeline to the world .
neutral	needs to be a smoother experience
negative	do not get involved with company - they are thieves and should not be allowed to remain in business .
negative	( cambridge service centre ) 0th_jan_0000 00 : 00
positive	great one stop_shop for most of your workshop needs .
positive	not too much packaging either and it '_s all recyclable which is important to me .
neutral	this was rubbish ; i live on a small but busy public access road .
negative	just got fined for parking in a perfectly legal area . see you court .
neutral	i may use them again , subject to some guarantees about the quality of delivery .
neutral	noon came and went and i tried_calling again .
negative	told every time that the parts would arrive the next_day .
negative	i will never use this company again and i recommend that no one else does either to avoid wasting your money .
negative	two hours_later , i called them again .
positive	thank_you for very quick delivery and quality and price for the guitar stand .
neutral	unfortunately the box fell_apart somewhere along the delivery process and also a tin of golden syrup burst / leaked and left everything sticky .
negative	as a single_female traveller it was another heart in mouth moment !
positive	my only_downfall was screwing the handles on the draw as it wasn_'_t very clear where the washer and the nut went . maybe it was me being blonde !
positive	excellent service clothes were delivered the next_day with a 0 hour time_slot .
neutral	this was excellent as you did not even have to put in any numbers .
negative	i ordered a product that was " in stock " and was a bit disappointed when i learnt that it would take 0 - 00 business days ( i . e .
neutral	i also returned to find the car surrounded_by fairly deep water on all sides - not ideal !
negative	when we tried to enter the cinema to watch the film i was asked about the age of my son , who is fifteen_years old and we were told he didnt look old enough , even_though he is the biggest in his class .
positive	very efficient company with extremely fast service .
positive	good service all_round !
negative	you should be_ashamed .
positive	i just purchased a oki_c000dn printer for printerland , the service was excellent and the prices lower_than anyone_else on the net .
neutral	was told a different a figure that i would be getting then told it would be less , not happy at all not really dealt_with professionally not offered any form of compensation just stated its a training issue not really good enough considering how much money they make as a company
positive	would highly_recommend .
negative	again . a faulty product and waited 0_weeks so far fir a postage refund .
negative	my mother who is down sizing was going to put it into the charity_shop and i did plead with her for me to have it .
negative	i am so looking_forward to receiving it and the years of memories it brings with it .
negative	interparcel only have a 0 - 0 weekday number no good when collections go till_0pm and on saturdays !
positive	seriously .
neutral	just normal wear and tear !
negative	don_'_t touch barclay card , their customer service is rubbish .
neutral	it cost free to uk but cost £_00 to post to denmark .
negative	it came back as just under_£_00 and i accidentally declined the offer .
negative	we had to pay extra money to the driver because we werent at home when he delivered , but he hadnt told us when he was planning to deliver the goods in first place .
neutral	i had to do this 0 - 0 times before i understand to ignore the leap to a new page .
positive	000_%
neutral	the item i bought was as_described , the response to my offer was dealt_with quickly and communication was generally good .
neutral	a group of 00 lads on stag wanting to have a good time !
positive	very quick delivery , did everything right , no_problems
negative	again when they eventually did find the order i was told that unfortunately the sunglasses were no_longer available as they had been_discontinued several_years_ago .
positive	item delivered next_day after ordering online .
negative	despite the fact that i am sure the website did not say this when i ordered ( or i would have gone_elsewhere ), i have been told its basically tough_luck .
positive	very good service , price and product .
neutral	very good !!!
negative	they are actually breaking distant selling_regulations 0000 act which states that must be refunded at the earliest_opportunity and in under 00 calandar days .
neutral	this was about my 0th order , all others were good , sadly this order was badly packaged and 0 shampoo bottles were damaged - the tops had come off .
positive	in the past i '_ve always gone with various manufacturers laptops but could never get one with the specs i want until i discovered pc_specialist .
negative	in fact , have still not received all the items .
neutral	i went for an upgrade to a deluxe_bouquet for an extra £ 0 but was overall disappointed by the flowers that arrived .
positive	i highly_recommend myvetmeds for anyone_needing medication for their pet and in particular for repeat medication .
neutral	in the end i had to make a 00 mile_round_trip to pick it up from their depot .
neutral	unfortunately we are not impressed with the meals .
positive	i am so pleased with them , they are just what i needed at a price affordable .
negative	products may be good but no back up service will not help this company .
neutral	i usually browse the wine shops not the net but i found a " poire william " liqueur i had not seen before , punt e mes which very few stock and a 0000 vintage single estate port which read well on research .
negative	so we get their guy out to visit for an easy sale as mum needed blinds for her new apartment , and we were recommended the firm by the new building manager . ( bad mistake ).

neutral	slight gripe about the delivery charge as the map on the website suggested we were in the free delivery area but it turned_out we aren_'_t .
neutral	i buy heavy books from amazon , and only pay £ 0 . 00 postage , so just_kampers are , in my opinion , making excessive profit on their postage_charges .
positive	but actually no , that was not the case ; i was really pleasantly_surprised by the way i was dealt_with , the on - line buying process was as easy as it could be and delivery , following the security_checks , was made to me almost the next_day by a very helpful chap_who knew_exactly_what he was doing .
neutral	it gave_me an explanation as to the reasons_why the only way to get an increse and i qualify for one

neutral	if this is where villa_plus ' es are , then they are not for us .
neutral	i had been waiting for over two_weeks for it so i phoned to see what the hold up was and that is when they told me about not having a specific part of it and they were waiting until they got it in before they sent it to me .
negative	i have contacted them 0 times and have yet to receive a reply , have also tried to ring them without_success .

negative	they happily took my £_00 from my account a couple of weeks_ago but blatently never delivered .
negative	very very poor .
neutral	i had to drive to the depot at 0pm at night in icy conditions - along with my two year_old_son and the fact that i am 0_months pregnant too was not good !
neutral	instructed not to cut the intumescent strip but i had to in order to make it fit .
negative	one of the items indicated in stock , waiting for 0_days .
neutral	i sold an old laptop that was no_longer needed at home and through the cash in your gadgets i found they were willing to pay £_00 even_though the battery didn_'_t hold its charge ( compared with around £_00 on other_websites ).
negative	when i contacted national_shower_spares again they told me that they had sent me 0 emails previously but i had received neither ( in my inbox or spam folders ).
neutral	i was happy with the villa but feel the check out time should be reviewed or alternative short_term accomodation should be provided .
positive	the transaction was ' just as it said on the label '.
positive	when i have another phone to sell i will use them .
positive	every transaction with them has_been smooth , fast and painless .
negative	you select a date on the web , but the driver tries again anyway on the wrong day and then they either a ) hold your goods , b ) return them to sender , or c ) no show on the redelivery date forcing another phone_call .
negative	all of it .
neutral	you need to tighten up the whole of this element of your offerings / sales administration pronto !
neutral	good seevice , but the cheque took a while to come through .
neutral	this completed , they then tried to send on a different day , again ; left a card offering a phone number to contact .
negative	the text on the box is all in polish and there is some sort of uk to 0 - pin adapter just thrown in the bag , implying that the power_cable is a 0 - pin and i '_m supposed to use an_adapter to be able to plug it in !
positive	pleasantly_surprised with the ease in which it was possible to deal with the company considering we were suffering with ' recession ' problems and found our predicament difficult to speak about generally .
positive	the first time you need to be careful to set it up correctly ( you getting used to the system ), but after that it is easy and works well and transfer is fast .
negative	thought fair_enough .
negative	ordered a valentines special of 00 roses , bubbly and choclates and upgraded to the premium which can to £_00 in total .
positive	hope you continue to go from strength to strength .
neutral	and that it would be the following_day before delivery was made .
positive	well i cannot_fault the service at all , i ordered my free posting package for my phone .
positive	superb service with a smile .
negative	i would rather pay the extra at argos / pc_world or whoever and have the immediate use of it .
positive	only_drawback is that returns are not free so if heavy items would cost you quite a bit of money to post back
negative	so to date , i have had no flowers , no refund or explanation !!!!
negative	my son wanted to buy 0ds with his_birthday money , ordered it may_0000 , like others have said , when they eventually answered an_email kept saying would be despatched in 00_hours , never received anything , very quick to take money out of your account , not so quick at answering the telephone .
neutral	service delivery & returns great , sizing poor , jeans had thighs too small waist too large on tomboy jeans
positive	it was just so easy and completed in a few_days from the time of going on the site to getting the cheque . i would certainly deal with them again .
neutral	also any additional_charge for faster delivery .
neutral	!
positive	pruducted arrived quickly .
negative	let '_s just say that i have had issues with my broadband performance for some months now and when i contact them i am told incorrect information .
positive	brilliant , fast service .
negative	i was told that i should have given a written notice after giving xln time period of 00 days to fix the problem .
positive	wide_selection , fast and easy transaction .
neutral	it only cost about 00 pounds so i can '_t be_bothered to return it .
positive	first time to use justoffbase excellent service , delivered in 0 days , quality products at the right price an free delivery .
negative	they aren_'_t a bad company for getting stuff posted and they are a legit site , its just the fact that this is my first experience using them and its not taking 00_hours to reply like they say its looking more like 00 days !
neutral	sadly had to send shoes back they hurt my foot across thetoe area not heard a word from anyone sent a week_ago do i get money back orwill someone call me ????
negative	this was my first and last ever time of using these_cowboys .
negative	i called a week_ago to ask where my loyalty cheque was ( after waiting 00 days ) response was its on the desk waitingto be posted - may be another week - on complaining was informed youre lucky to get a cheque not all companies offer a dual_fuel discount !!!!!!!
negative	no apologies from them .
neutral	very disappointed !
positive	there was no problem shipping to where i work and they arrived next_day .
negative	only 0_months later and my fence is literally useless .
neutral	my folks were chuffed as they can ’_t find this wine they love in the shops .
negative	have not received my products ordered , been going on several months , no response to e_-_mails or letters , these people cannot be contacted by telephone .
positive	thank_you for a very pleasent stay .
positive	received the paperwork for sending it away within 0_days , instructions were very simple to follow .
neutral	on the plus_side though all other parcels delivered fine , the website is good and the service has_been reliable .
neutral	i am very happy with the colour .
neutral	i use them because they offer a good variety of services at a reasonable_price but stay away from hermes or yodel .
negative	i needed vari - focal lens .
negative	it failed to meet the purpose it was purchased for and therefore is no_longer required .
positive	love my sidi st boots , had been looking at these for a while and thought i would treat_myself .
neutral	item has not yet been delivered because delivery driver ' could not find property '.
neutral	need to get your prices down for , like my hermes
positive	keep it up primark !
neutral	i think it '_s important people realise resorthoppa are an agency for transfer companies so its not entirely their fault if a company is bad , they obviously do need to scrap some in mallorca altogether if they don_'_t sort things out though .
neutral	i ordered boots which were lovely but did not quite fit .
negative	you have no floor .'
positive	i have brought from these_people many_times in the past , & they usually deliver in quickly , as a bathroom_fitter i trust i will be able to get the items i order within 0 or 0 days , there are cheaper companies out there , but beware a lot of these companies don_'_t hold stock & then will keep you waiting for weeks which is no good to me .
negative	please_accept our sincere_apologies for the delay in replying .
negative	so if i returned the item , i would no_longer have it ( obviously ) and i would be more out of pocket than if i kept it , ( and obviosuly still had the item !)
negative	well what can i say 0 st time av ordered from you not happy at all the flowers looked nothing like your picture advertised i will_defo not be ordering or recommending you again it '_s only been a day and the flowers are already diein wish i could post a picture ther a joke !
neutral	the communication with urbis intimated that this was entirely not their problem as flight data is supplied to them , from london , by travel_republic . so it was my responsibility to arrange alternative timed transfers .
positive	great service thank_you cheers eugene .
positive	tooled_- up . com came up best price and delivered quickly , great result .
positive	it was entirely my fault and i did not expect the company to take it back .
neutral	we tried every other number that funnily_enough stopped_working , even_though it was fine the day before when we used it to confirm our pickup times .
neutral	unfortunately they have only lasted three_days which at the cost of them was dissapointed with them .
negative	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary_school , they did not fit as the arms were at different_angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
positive	would definately order from this site again , i found some great products that i use reguallary at great prices , beats everywhere_else i look online and in - store .
neutral	no other credit_card could be used other than the named_driver .
positive	brilliant service .
positive	i tried them on and picked my two favourites , placed my order on the saturday and sent the frames back .
neutral	shame .
positive	i will always recommend igful to my friends .
negative	truly_awful .
positive	i plan to continue to use pet_prescription for a while yet !
positive	we were emailed within 00_hrs to say that our cards had been despatched and would be delivered 0 - 0_days_later .
negative	worst experience ever .
neutral	the ordering process was easy and the information on the website was clear & accurate .
positive	brilliant service .
positive	iflorist really is a good online service - the website is straightforward , there is heaps of choice throughout , and ordering is also quick and easy .
neutral	i understand this is the issue of the manufacturer but maybe this is something you should consider feeding back to them .
positive	i needed a usb pen and needed it quick .
positive	having 0 cats fighting on the windowsill , our blinds were looking in a terrible state .
negative	any acknowledgement or sympathy for the fact that an_unexpected cost of £_000 , so close to a holiday can have a massive impact on a customers ability to actually afford to do anything whilst on holiday ?
negative	how_dare you delay your response to emails , and then expect a prompt reply to your ‘ offer of refund ’ within 00_hours .
neutral	when my order arrived in a very speedy manor i was again thrilled with your service .
neutral	stop this nonsence and just give us straight_forward parking price and stop ripping us off
positive	my rab boulder hoodie arrived quickly and i am really pleased with it !
positive	when i had to phone regarding a query , i found the person to very knowledgeable about the products they are selling .
positive	great service , would certainly order from them again .
positive	ordered this for my own use at my 00th_birthday_party .
positive	best price i could find any where , delivery was as it said on the web_site .
positive	arrived in under 00_hours .
neutral	once fault light was reset all works well with no further problems .
negative	now , i found out the next_day that the call had in fact cost me £_00 !
positive	my order was confirmed very quickly and i was even able to delay the despatch date by a day to meet my requirements .
positive	received a phone_call when they were half an_hour away , saved them pulling up outside the house and knocking us up .
neutral	however the item itself was new and in excellent condition as ordered .
neutral	!
neutral	this is why i think busuu should only be used as an additional tool coincide with a language course or book and not a single learning resource .
negative	they looked to be good quality at a reasonable price .
negative	my latest experience takes the biscuit .
positive	very easy rewarding_experience , spread the word !
neutral	i chose the screw earrings as i didn_'_t want to lose them if the butterfly came off .
neutral	i used this and went to the sending location only to be told i needed he label with the barcode .
neutral	whatever they said , nobody had phoned me before , ( my phone records all numbers ).
neutral	lost some of the feet for the wire racks in our microwave .
neutral	the product came as requested without_any damage and responses from customer service were quick when i emailed them , however i was disappointed as i had ordered the product on the 00th_dec as a gift for someone for christmas thinking that was adequate time , the email i received on ordering said it should be dispatched within a week however it wasn_'_t actually dispatched until the 00st_dec to be delivered on the next working day which was the 00th_dec , i '_d already left to visit family for christmas so it arrived too late .
neutral	very happy with the flowers , but unfortunately the delivery driver did not follow out delivery instructions .
negative	i figured that if there was a problem that i would be contacted .
neutral	it would have been a much_better transaction if i '_d known the item wasn_'_t in stock from the outset .
positive	by tuesday the called me to arrange delivery for thursday and they delivered at 0 :_00am for a 0am to 00pm delivery slot .
positive	with no added salt or water that doesn_'_t happen - and that sets the tone for the quality food you get .
neutral	however , it did not take away from the fact that a stranger had received my invites with a picture of my son on and my mobile number .
negative	most people would agree that a parcel has shipped only when it '_s been collected by or dropped_off with the courier .
negative	it is not a fibre - optic network ( as widely advertised ) - bits of it may be , but most of it is the cheapest , nastiest coaxial cable that they could_find , and is rapidly rotting , giving all_sorts of intermittent faults and random reductions in their already compromised data rates .
negative	today i vote with my feet and raise awareness so you are not humiliated as this cannot be accepted .
positive	i have bought many many orders from shc and have found excellent products , a very fast and reliable delivery service and extremely fair postage_costs .
positive	i had a vague_idea what i wanted but this was helped by the direct sales approach from music_matters .
neutral	after 0 separate conversations , and growing frustration they eventually delivered the missing parts thursday .
negative	no one is prepared to deal with our complaint in an efficient manner . flybe say there is only one price at checkout but how can you tell .
neutral	the item i ordered was not quite what i got , i asked for bone shaped tablets and i got ordinary round tablets .
negative	amar . daroch @ ntlworld . com
negative	this never happened .
negative	the girl on the end of the phone was very apologetic and stressed that it would be delivered the following_day and that even_though i had given them over a weeks notice for the delivery date they had just failed to complete the paperwork .
positive	then you select the one you want , pay for it and that '_s it done .
neutral	their reply was quick and accurate but many replied in their own language which i found hard to communicate with .
positive	most_importantly , all_budgets !
positive	they deliver when they say they will and the communication between client and supplier is quick .
positive	i didn_'_t see the flowers but my friend said they were beautiful the delivery time is fantastic next_day delivery free
positive	the real test will be aftersales but if they deliver what they promised then that should make owing our new car as easy and enjoyable as buying it .
positive	hi , just thought i '_d let you know , i '_ve found this great website for all you medical / health needs and much more at very reasonable_prices .
neutral	my ( husband '_s ) 0 photos were subtle in tone and colour but with a fresh ( winter ) sparkle to them - this was lost in the cards and the colours appeared dulled and in one case ' greyed '.
positive	excellent service , keep_up the good work .
positive	awesome & painless
negative	was told on friday i would receive in 00 - 00_hours but i '_m not holding my breath
negative	i pre_- ordered gta_v with shopto - it was my first order with them despite creating an account some time ago .
negative	i have been contacted 00 times in 0_days by this company .
neutral	also , the selling and buying of iphones is so common .
positive	what great service !
neutral	fortunately we had allowed 0 hours before the flight so we just managed to get the shuttle_bus , go through check - in , grab a sandwich to eat through security , and then board with no time to spare .
neutral	in that way i paid about 000_euros for the tickets , that were worth 000_euros !
positive	best price on the net , best service and best delivery with a 0 hour timed window !!
positive	++++
negative	click the link to set_up a menrchant account to accept credit_cards and you get taken to a form that only applies to us customers !
negative	please dont promise people anything unless you can deliver especially children .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t take them long to update the site so the watches that aren_'_t eligible are listed as such though , so read what you what into the way they present their refund policy .
positive	when the driver is in your area he rings to say how long it will be before he delivers - very good service and far_superior to other_firms we have dealt_with recently .
neutral	he said he had a few two - seater sections available & asked if we would like a window seat to which we said yes to both .
neutral	all the choices for phone_recycling ( yourselves included ) say the price may vary upon_inspection so 0 years_ago , as i had no experience of this process , i was pleasantly_surprised when the offered price didn_'_t change .
neutral	furthermore the internal floor panels promised by the designer had not been ordered .
positive	pricing was competitive including delivery , but it was the positive customer comments that sold me !
negative	this time i am demanding my money back and compensation .
positive	we will recommend this company to all our friends .
negative	i was very unhappy with my booking as it cost me an extra £_00 as apparently i had booked a crossing from calais to dover when i wanted a crossing from dover to calais .
neutral	you had to turn the very heavy desk upside_down to access the wood , the screws had obviously not been put in by hand and were very difficult to undo .
neutral	i like the wide_range of items on offer and i like some of the specially priced offers .
neutral	the tables arrived on the specified day of delivery so i was happy but on opening the package they looked very different to the picture on the website !
neutral	00_minutes later good news and bad_news .
neutral	a request for fairness might also be better_than a straight threat in this regard although maybe there have been a lot of people violating the exposure rule in an attempt to save what is really a reasonable fee .
neutral	product arrived later than_expected .
neutral	can '_t ask for much more .
neutral	i requested sunflowers but there was not one in the bouquet and the greeting_card to say who they were from was for some else entirely .
negative	ace - fx are rubbish ; and i shall never deal with them again .
neutral	good prices but not so good on delivery etc .
positive	i would recommend them without_hesitation .
negative	avoid at all costs !!!!
negative	but in the event , next - day took 0 days .
negative	i hope some one at_least read at respond to me for the first time !
negative	i have always purchased vast_amounts of online household products through various online companies with my property business and i can_honestly_say i have never come_across a company that not only legally walks the tight rope but morally have a total_disregard for its customer .
neutral	clearly seraphine is not to the same beast and perhaps it '_s not fair on me to compare .
neutral	really pleased
negative	i intend to press charges
positive	would buy again .
negative	therefore , it is the case that they have his cheque without supporting_documentation .
neutral	charged extra for immediate delivery which failed , ordered standard spec but told i ordered custom fit if that was the case only needed reading and they would have noticed it was a standard club which they had in stock so wasted 0 days .
negative	well surprise_surprise we were turned away with the poor promise of priority tix for next series - if it gets recommissioned .
negative	beware !!
neutral	get emails_telling_me it '_s left the same day and week_later no stuff
negative	i ordered and paid for goods on 0 dec . a week_later , as the goods had not arrived , i emailed them and they said they were having trouble getting supplies .
negative	rang them up and currently still holding on after 0hr and 00_minutes
negative	nowhere is this clearly_stated !
negative	the title is what i see too often on the argos website .
neutral	i am keeping all the paperwork since i '_m_sure i will be making a claim on the lifetime_warranty .
neutral	do not specify your costume size enough
positive	vfm , quick delivery and good comms .
negative	she_lives at flat 00 the orchard in a sheltered_accommodation area .
neutral	but returns cost me £ 0 to ship back item + £ 0 . 00 deducted from refund to cover their shipping charges .
negative	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 no reply from email i sent on the same day i wrote initial review , wrote to them via fb .
neutral	used it for france and i can '_t fault the layout or content .
negative	spent next few_months receiving bill letters from them despite never having any internet with them at all !
neutral	so , aircon alone cost me £_00 with halfords & £_00 with specialist !
negative	eventually got a call back from customer_services saying they were sorry but as themadrid florists were very busy my valentines_day flowers would not be delivered on valentines but the next_day .
neutral	loved the range of cards , but they put the wrong age on the one chosen so aged my sister by years which wasn_'_t appreciated .
neutral	when the flowers arrived they looked beautiful and fresh well preserved .
positive	the product was exactly_what i expected it to be , great lip_gloss , great quality as its a nars product .
positive	very quickly delivery .
neutral	sorry to expensive
neutral	when i tried to alter the arrangements on dpd site , it wouldn_'_t let_me so the items were delivered on the tuesday after i '_d had to re - arrange my day - thought i '_d got that one covered .
negative	for just under 0 hrs today , having_spoken the transport company 0 times a lorry finally arrived at the far end of the road .
positive	will buy again in the future .
neutral	are all their flowers sent like this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	have ordered from interflora and will be chasing a full_refund with compensation .
positive	why put your old_mobile in draw to be forgotten when clicking on mazuma and simply typing in your details can get you money back on it or vouchers if you prefer .
negative	i asked for my money back , but have not heard a word since .
neutral	great customer service but the quality of coffee is not a patch on nespresso .
negative	notified after closing time by text_message , so there '_s nothing can be done for the same day despatch as they sell it , and charge for it - nothing cheap about delivery costs here !
negative	i had to wait another week before finally receiving my item .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my refund and have had to resort to raising a dispute with my bank to see if they can get me my money back .
positive	i feel much safer going around corners now .
positive	i was looking for a waterproof chair seat_cover for my mum and found the product i needed easily at care shop .
positive	before i knew it my pack had arrived and in perfect_timing for my birthday trek in knoydart .
positive	i would definitely use them again and recommend to others .
positive	it '_s easy to enrol and order .
positive	i wanted to get something special for two of my best friends 00th birthdays .
positive	i accidently sent my order twice as i thought the first order hadn_'_t gone_through .
positive	we also had everything pre_- oiled , which has a longer lead time but saves quite a bit of effort .
negative	wth ?
neutral	used to shop with play . com regularly but they '_ve now introduced postal_charges options ( free_postage takes longer now ).
neutral	yours baffled
negative	they said no please ignore it but this was purposely built and it had my name and address on it but the wrong billing information .
neutral	not only did it look like the leaning tower of pisa next to another piece of furniture but also anything round would roll off the top .
negative	this company is letting down the businesses that use them to deliver their product
neutral	people on o0 , vodaphone and indeed 0 seem to have no trouble with the network_coverage but t - mobile seems to constantly struggle .
positive	bought made to measure_blinds for my nursery and they were brilliant .
neutral	batteries are delicate but heavy and liable to damage if not package well .
positive	kept_upto_date with delivery time throughout the day .
positive	you can go to loads of sites around london using the pass and most of the time we didn_'_t have to queue .
negative	i prefer lonely planet anytime as they never get it wrong .
negative	so i called to get a pac_number for my new network_provider .
negative	amazed at how small and mean these looked .
neutral	even more annoying when ou have to pay for p_&_p !
negative	0 jan_0000 00 : 00 : 00 am cambridge_cambridgeshire gb arrival scan
negative	a rather lengthy story , but i think it warrants telling .
negative	i then brought out the big guns .
positive	ordered the arab costume at the last_minute due to my son deciding he did actually need a costume for his last day at school !
negative	first of all i was given a quote of £_000 .
negative	no reply from them and they sent me the cheque for the money .

negative	would you trust them ?
positive	!
neutral	end has a wide rage of great clothing and i shop_here all them time .
positive	absolutely first_class service , nothing too much_trouble .
neutral	the head_torch packaging itself was also slightly crushed , fortunately head_torch itself wasn_'_t damaged .
neutral	impressively competitively_priced but i could not read the instructions as the print was so tiny and alas the " certificate " did not print out from teh e_- mail .
positive	both are brilliant , in fact the second_pair is my favourite !
neutral	however my daughter has had to throw half of them out within a few_days .
positive	they really are the lowest with a great ' price promise '.
negative	merry_christmas !
positive	!
positive	with eastern holidays in the middle , six days from order the i was walking wearing my new shoes .
neutral	we arrived @ dalaman_airport and found the coach straight_away a transfer that normally takes 0 . 00_hours took nearly 0 hours we ended_up getting of and walking to our hotel as we had to change buses and the driver didnot have a clue_where he was going
neutral	but there does not seem to be any insentive from them to do this .
negative	phone took an age to be answered , in all not very good .
neutral	as far as the ordering and delivery schedule this could not be easier
neutral	aside from this , the website boasts great pricing and is easy to use .
positive	ordered item one night two_days_later it was delivered brilliant service try them
negative	i ordered door_handles online for a refurbishment project .
neutral	following my review , after a phone_call from the driver , he insisted that they had knocked and received no answer .

positive	the prices are reasonable
neutral	i recently tried to cancel 0 business lines .
positive	with the discount_code the two_pairs of glasses were amazing value .

positive	an excellent service and i will order again .
neutral	after 0 days and several_attempts , the key managed to work .

positive	as i didn_'_t need them immediately chose free p_&_p but they arrived very quickly .
neutral	hi i have already filled a survey out telling villa_plus what went wrong with our holiday so why should i have relive it over and over again it was the most uncomfortable one we have had for years i know the villa was just somewhere to lay our heads but to lay them just about a foot ( 000_mm ) from the floor for people of our age it is not good so please do not send me any more emails asking me what m our holiday was like it was not the best we have had . the staff were good lanzarote great the villa '_s position nice the furnishing was crap in our opinion
positive	discounts given for loyalty .
positive	what can i say , the samsung_galaxy_sii is a beautiful phone , well_designed , full of apps and features which are mainly provided by the superb android 0 . 0 . 0 ( ice_cream sandwich ) os .
negative	" your parcel has_been left with your neighbour at no 0 / 0 "
negative	after chasing for a reply two_days_later i received an_email 0_days after that saying the following .
positive	the delivery will take a few_days but the driver was very friendly unlike_some other company drivers !
negative	i asked if they could do anything on the very expensive postage which was £_00 . 00 for what was now going to be 0 day delivery , and that seemed excessive , but they refused to even even try .
negative	i '_m going to be calling my card company to ask them to charge the money back to the company as based on most reviews here they are doing this a lot and seem to be crooks .
neutral	they finally got back to me to tell me that it would be with them in a week and then they would post royal_mail .
negative	i spoke to [_name_] who seemed to have resolved other complaints on here .
positive	also less expensive than a rival online site .
negative	for crying out loud , all i want is for my parcel to be collected and to be delivered to its_destination .
positive	!
negative	i could do with a laugh today .
neutral	i think the return_policy should be longer .
neutral	hopefully this is only a minor_blip from an otherwise reputable_company
neutral	the coffee itself though is rather nice , so it '_s a shame about the capsules !
negative	it usually costs me about an extra £_00 - 00 pounds to use another airline - well_worth it .
negative	including kkarparks ltd . more car parking .
negative	we purchaced 0 tickets at twice the market value from viagogo , not problem we knew what the prices were before we bought them , only to find when we arrived the tickets were not valid due to duplication and we had to buy three more ticket to gain_entry to strickley come dancing on sat ( 00 . 00 . 00 ) the ticket supplier can not be trusted in the words of nia security , there was at_least 0 other people with the same tickets , alway buy from a secure sourse 0 tickets have cost us 000 + , we spoke viagogo on sunday who were not interest , we have sent e , mail and copies of e , mail from security of the nia still no reponce shocking
neutral	that '_s why i get all my stuff from them
positive	everyone i spoke to was helpful , providing excellent service despite needing my item re - quoting for several_times .
positive	hubby is over the moon with his new tool .
neutral	prices are compatible wiv other_companies and took more dvds / cds than other_companies .
positive	the remaining transaction was very smooth .
positive	i have used them a few_times and would recommend them , especially on price .
positive	always get professional , friendly treatment from the team there , and always get good value for money based on honest servicing requirements .
positive	a travel insurer you can_trust .
neutral	when the flowers arrived they were buddy and fresh but because they had not been packed properly the stems of some flowers were bent and 0 flowers were broken off the lily stems .
positive	hassle_free maintenance as it should be .
neutral	has_been collected and awaiting further_action .
negative	they did not refund any postage either .

positive	will use again .
positive	i have , since making the investment , which proved to be easy , had excellent service from the company and am satisfied that i made a sensible investment decision .
negative	my sister then contacted thorntons to ask them for a replacement or a refund , and the cheeky bugger tried to worm their way out of it !
neutral	i got my cheque ok about a week after i had posted the books out .
negative	any business needs a robust structure to ultimately deliver an exceptional customer experience .
neutral	sadly , the portable_hard_drive was poorly_packaged which meant that it arrived with a dent in it .
negative	i want to talk to one person not two .
negative	i had given no instruction to leave in a shed .

neutral	but it took a bit long to come .
positive	wanted some gift_voucher , used the very easy website and the vouchers were delivered to me with in a couple of days .
positive	the interest_rates potentially available greatly exceeded those offered by conventional savings institutes .
neutral	ordering was quite simple but when i saw the delivered flowers they were not quite the same as i had ordered .
neutral	haven_'_t put the shed up yet as the new delivery date has now over lapped our holiday and are now back at work . the shed looks good quality though .
neutral	guess where i am pretty_much guaranteed not be , during office hours .
positive	we can thoroughly_recommend the place .
positive	so proved they had lied about nobody in flat how many more customers do they do this too .
neutral	the 0 year_guarantee was a bit_dodgy as i had to pay for the parts but not the labour .
positive	excellent service from a very good company , products exceptional value and quality . i will be using this company for all my husbands suits from now on .
negative	still_waiting for item 0 month of placing my order for an item that was shown as in stock .
neutral	in august i went into what i thought was my isp '_s web_site to check my billing statement .
neutral	a bad policy all_round and may put us off renting from goldcars in the future .
neutral	it would be beneficial to both the customer and supplier ( reduce unnecessary costs ) if a pre_- notification of forthcoming autodispatch was sent to customers a couple of weeks in advance asking them to confirm or change the arrangements .
neutral	- ordered an original optoma part but was offered a replacement because of the long wait from optoma .
negative	i would steer_clear of this website as there is no way to tell if the review is true or not .
positive	go - electrical made the process more personal and friendly .
neutral	your new website is great to look at but the drop downs don_'_t give you enough information about where to look for products and your product search_facility is unhelpful .
neutral	i had to re - read the home page twice more before i realised my mistake .
negative	really frustrated with the service - bad delivery - ordered and paid extra £ 0 for next_day delivery ( and before the cut - off time ), next_day delivery was confirmed , they charged me £ 0 .
negative	took_ages to get my items then i found some of my racks had parts of the shelf missing .
negative	delivery men saying that they knocked when they didn_'_t , leaving expensive goods literally on the door_step , despite the fact the path across the front of our house is used by everyone living on the street , and even deliveries not showing up at all .
positive	this was an excellent and efficient sservice and i would use this company again .
positive	i have used mazuma 0 times now and its the service i always will use !
negative	finally no reduction on bill or anything complimentary , really bad service / food / place .
neutral	not very happy i '_ve been charged nearly_£ 0 extra when i didn_'_t need these things .
neutral	recently i ordered some items from bondra , i have ordered items in the past and had no_issues .
negative	the problem was i ordered a birthday card , the p_&_p rates being a little high , but not high enough to arouse my suspicion about where the damn_thing would be despatched from .
neutral	apart_from the annoying sales_pitch for the warranty , which is where ao seems to be making approx 00_% of their profits from , i would buy from them again .
negative	ordered at 00am , paid for same - day delivery .
negative	emailed them 0_days ago telling them they had 0_days to sort it or i would be moving supplier .
neutral	i was happy to see that i could prganise the holiday , flights and everything else possible through travel replublic .
neutral	i emailed the company , but i got no reply .
neutral	please can you make it clear when the items are fully out of stock and you do not expect more , the website is very misleading .
positive	i bought two storage bags at the same time as the ones offered also fit the bill .
negative	used in the past and flowers delivered very late ( days ), did find out till long time after so left it .
neutral	to get a parcel that has not been collected ( and my irate customers have usually waited in especially all day ) is the annoying for them and for me to contact by phone , live_chat or email is a nightmare .
negative	it took the money from my card very soon , but it haven_'_t dispatched the order for over one month !
negative	i had specifically booked a time and date for the delivery to come so that i would have all the essential items i needed .
neutral	i did not get a response .
negative	so i went online to rearrange delivery the next_day to my neighbours but apparently kitty litter requires the signature of the addressee only .
negative	i cannot under any circumstances recommend this company .
negative	sadly i wont_be using viagogo again . very disappointed .
negative	i have ordered via another trustworthy online company and at_least my friend has a gift .
neutral	not a good start but hey no_problems with my last car !
negative	have made a return but going by the terms and conditions they stipulate dont hold out much hope .
negative	they then charge a minimum of 00 pounds to send it back if you reject their offer .
positive	after typing my message for the card and confirming by order i realised i had not put the name of who it was going to .
positive	the only_negative_aspect : they offered the most expensive insurance while the cheaper ones were only mentioned on demand .
positive	bargain !
negative	no more junk_mail please !!!!
negative	we booked a top of the range villa in costa_blanca a while back .
neutral	would recommend .
positive	overall they are ok
neutral	i know it doesn_'_t sound like a major problem but it wasn_'_t what i had ordered and when using them for gifts as an illustrator the appearance of the overall product really counts .
positive	thanks to all involved .
neutral	in this case the pump was ok but why risk it !
positive	sam was a pleasure working with and when i accidentally provided the wrong number he helped_me correct the mistake and get the funds transferred quick !
positive	couldn_'_t fault the service or help over the phone from them .
neutral	i would like to see made sharpen up this element of the service .
negative	working
positive	i had a great experience with these_guys , bought a small bass_amp .
positive	on a separate note , the better half was amazed i managed to get some and was very grateful .
positive	excellent service
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of glasses in the same frames ( but different_colours ).
negative	0nd week of march comes and goes . no ladders .
positive	they were very reliable and prompt .
negative	the " track my order " page still lists my order as not having shipped and i have no tracking_number to verify that it is on its way .
neutral	then had to wait 0_days for another one i gave the shop the tools that came with the phone to remove the sim_card but didn_'_t get them back .
neutral	thankfully they were not taken but i had to contact her and spoil the surprise by asking her to go and look outside .
negative	is that even legal ?
negative	yes an error has_been made and in case you did not understand i will clarify the situation once again .
negative	as discussed , the quality of the internet service was frequently extremely poor and we had consistent problems throughout our time with icuk , none of which were identified as issues with our hardware or anything our end .
neutral	although i was only 0nd in line it still took an_eternity to take the details and fill out the forms for the person in front of me ( at_least 00_mins , part of this was to do with the lady wanting to read through all the t &_c and examine the detail of all the scratches , dinks and dents on the car she was taking , when my turn came it still took at_least 00_mins , in , fairness it is the same with almost every rental company , by the time i was finished the queue was 00 deep , those at the back would be waiting for an_hour , there has to be a better way
negative	very chic and fashionable .
negative	i '_ve never dealt_with such incompetence in my life !
positive	well_worth it .
neutral	l : illys were lovely .
negative	i therefore rang o0 ( as im an existing customer ) only for them to tell me as an existing client i would be an " automatic accept " and they had no record of my application from their end !
neutral	my tip would be to carefully check you have everything you need before you start installation ( luckily i did ).
positive	using a search_engine i found this comparison web_site and saved money .
negative	my previous order took them a month to restock , even_though i paid £ 0 for two business day delivery .
neutral	brilliant professional customer service focused and helpful but national_tyres kilmarnock have ruined my alloys
positive	very easy transaction and pleased with product and delivery
neutral	my pc dont work how can i send emails . phone would be 00x better :/
neutral	we ordered this item and it was promptly delivered , however whilst construction was not difficult the instructions in a foreign_language did not help .
positive	super top_class service
positive	was amazed_at how quick the items arrived , less_than 00_hours from ordering and that was on a normal delivery
neutral	experience with sixt , not so .
negative	booked a hotel and transfer with alpha_rooms , there was a problem with the website and it did not confirm transfer , tried to book again and it took my payment 0 times .
positive	thank_you .
negative	paypal is a gateway to fraud !
negative	instead they offered a replacement battery at reduced cost which i reluctantly paid for but it never arrived .
neutral	this is the third a00 brace that i have bought but the grey mesh wear '_s out quite fast .
neutral	booked this a long way back to get a decent price .
negative	it also advised that the mail item which were a set of 0 weeded puzzles will be shipped on 00nd_november .
neutral	i spoke to her again today , just 0_days after delivery and she told me she was going to have to throw them out soon as they were looking sorry for themselves .
negative	00th_april_0000 reply_saying sorry etc .
positive	from the first enquiry to today , the day after delivery clms could not have been more helpful with follow ups from time to time as i waited for the car to be built .
negative	we have just had another call from them at 0 . 00 this afternoon saying that it wasn_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be getting any more until end of month !
neutral	everything about the glasses are great except the frames are just too big , i got two_pairs and it is true for both they seem to expect people to have seriously large heads .
positive	not a scratch on the lenses and no_problems with my perscription .
positive	i '_ve had very good experiences with the program and i got excellent service from marion at the help team when i had a problem with the installation .
negative	i specifically_asked if they were from google and the woman said yes and that they would extend my free period by two_weeks , i didn_'_t even know i had a free period .
neutral	when i rang up to speak to someone to get the remainder of the sets sent to me , i was disappointed to find i could not have the discounted set price now and would have to buy the pedestal mats separately !
positive	the manufacturer supplied every possible answer for every siingle question i had . . left me speechless and very satisfied .
positive	main_reason is that when faced with a considerable_amount of money and what to do with it in order to get the best deal for you , then there is always a worry that you may choose the wrong doors to go through but with the help of employees like leanne_smith , who , with her expertise in guiding_me through the transition process it was made very simple indeed and hassle_free , so for that i have to say a huge thank_you to her for that service .
negative	!
neutral	they did not arrive until 0 . 00pm on the day after that which is not really acceptable
negative	after_speaking to my daughter i decided to email you first and give you the chance to restore my faith in tesco ’_s before taking the matter further .
negative	i placed my order on 00feb order itself didn_'_t ship until the 00 and now its 0 mar . and i '_m still_waiting .
negative	placed order 00 / 0 / 00
negative	if the item is damaged in transit it your fault apparently .
positive	the tyres feel very good with no vibrations when going fast on the motorway .
neutral	also , as it was such an obvious fault i '_m annoyed that it was missed and still sent to me .
negative	!
neutral	i went into an electrical store to purchase a dyson but came out with something totally different brand , this was partial to do with price and functions against other models and the staff_members recommendation .
neutral	i would avoid them .
positive	i cannot recommend these_guys enough for a fair deal and satisfaction all_round .
positive	the prices are competitive and the delivery fast and reliable .
positive	i have used this site four times_now & all the orders have arrived within a couple of days .
negative	and nobody has time to spend their lives reading small_print , hence_why they have to be fair and reasonable , or the key points notified to customers .
positive	even the courier used was good because it allowed festive_lights to email me with a rough time the courier would arrive and you could actually go to the couriers website and check where the driver was and what delivery number you were and what delivery number he was on .
negative	after_reading this review the company has_been in touch and all issues has_been resolved but that took over 0_months
negative	once my contract_ends i will leave them and never return .
neutral	i thought this was a bit short as the other meats had much longer .
positive	would use again and recommend !
positive	the items l ordered arrived quickly and were great quality .
neutral	phoned and was told someone would get back to me .
neutral	no .
negative	i wrote perhaps 00 or 00 e_- mails_asking for the whereabouts of my purchase .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	the emailed paper_work with all details arrived promptly and the parking company at the other end always knows about my booking with all details .
neutral	the end product was poor quality , badly printed and not at all what i expected for what i paid .
positive	i love the option of list view or map_view , to see how each_hostel competes relative to others .
neutral	i really like the fact that they are individually packaged , however out of 0 boxes i had 0 pods which had burst making them useless .
neutral	was when they sanded down the paintwork , ready for spraying .
negative	i '_ve never_experienced a company like it .
positive	a simple , speedy and efficient way to dispose of an old phone .
neutral	though disappoint no email , i was fine with that , after all it was late_afternoon on a friday . but " will be with you soon " to me is too vague , as i had tto take a day off to wait in for it on the monday , so i sent another email monday mid_morning asking if i should expect today ?
negative	edit_: still on hold 00mins
positive	excellent .
negative	as i was making my order on the online designer , it went fine .
negative	i telephoned to ask if wowcher could assist in helping with availability however they quickly advised i had to call the merchant who said i then had to pay more money if i wanted the date advertised .
neutral	delivery wasnt that quick but ok .
negative	try as i might to contact a manager , while the engineer was there failed , with various excuses .
positive	this is my first order with them and the response has_been excellent .
positive	i would reccommend to everyone .
positive	good work guys .
negative	i am still_waiting to hear if i can have the jacket .
negative	why on earth can '_t the refund take place straight_away ?
positive	this is the 0nd time i '_ve_used myvetmeds and if anything the service was even better this time - probably because i bought two lots of medicine so saved on postage_costs .
negative	ordered a karcher , washer and hose , no delivery or order history on my account , have not received items so cancelled order 00 / 00 /_0000
positive	i like the way you can get all your smellies under one roof and there is no delivery to pay .
positive	easy to use website , good product and prompt delivery .
neutral	this too could have been made clear on the website .
negative	thank_you for nothing but wasting my time .
neutral	the journey to and from the tour was fine with no_problems .
positive	the result was a pension of £_000 a month .
neutral	i received a call from a vm rep one time offering me free phone and tv on top of my 00m package .
neutral	disappointed as the flowers arrived at 0 . 00_pm at night .
neutral	i think that the item was not in stock , but this was not apparent when i made the order .
neutral	hob was extremely well_wrapped ( i '_ve never seen so much bubble_wrap !)
neutral	the car itself was fine .
positive	superfast delivery !!
neutral	not great service , not least as i '_d left my baby waiting in the car .
positive	the quailty of the goods is excellent , delivery is prompt and if you have a query they answer promptly and helpfully .
neutral	' stoneacre offer full lifetime_guarantee on used cars , saving you having to purchase any warranty and are the only main uk motor dealers to do so .'
positive	pub within the day good times .
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong , they are nice , but not really worth the very high price paid .
positive	she advised the hotel it was our_honeymoon and also my husbands_00th_birthday and we had a bottle of champagne chilling in our room when we arrived .
positive	i will always purchase from this company excellent service
negative	after many emails and calls to <_external link_removed >,.
positive	excellent fast service with super value products .
positive	absolutely excellent .
positive	we have now booked two holidays through holidaysplease , both have been a good experience with no_hiccups !
neutral	came through to this website via sky_scanner , where i put in dates for the 00th to the 00th .
neutral	i was pleased with the rug and service , but i was disappointed that the rug has a slight imperfection , an irregular line in the pile .
positive	quick , efficient communication & delivety
positive	probably better_than i would have got if i ' d tryied to sell it on ebay .
neutral	so it seemed to be a bit of a lottery .
neutral	however they completely upset my solicitor with their constant pestering that he refused to deal with them so i had to do twice the work and go as the go between .
positive	not only do they have the best prices , but i won and ipod in one of thier contest .
neutral	i next paid on my uk visa_card , order accepted again online - no problem , money debited from my card .
negative	when i phoned up , i was rudely_told that i had to pay else they would persue me for the money .
positive	however , i '_m absolutely_delighted with it !
neutral	although my online booking confirmation stated that i only had to pay the agent another 00 . 00 euro '_s i had to swipe my card for a total of 000 . 00 euro '_s and not given the option of paying up front for a full_tank of petrol ( which i had no option ) or returning it full .
positive	placed an order .
positive	the product is fantastic and exactly as expected .
negative	in the meantime i am informed that my booking was cancelled and that i am not due any refund .
negative	avoid this company unless you are prepared to sell your phone for a fraction of its value !
positive	they were an exact_match , no one who has seen them can tell which are the original doors and which are the new doors , they are a perfect match .
neutral	she then checked that she had my mobile number ( reading out a totally different number to mine ), i gave her the correct number and she then said " goodbye mrs xxx , which wasnt my name at all !
positive	i order a ps0 on thursday and it was delivered on the next_day as promised , i have one very happy son !
positive	would recommend it .
negative	why not either a ) be jumped upon by the hawking sales staff when you look to be busy looking at something or b ) find nobody in sight when you need assistance ?
neutral	i called cancellations before the 0 day period and was assured i '_m not being charged for the tv and phone and that he would do whatever in the system to ensure i '_m not charged more than i '_m currently paying .
negative	they said they had it in their warehouse and i could have it in 0 working_days .
neutral	and to top it off , most of my food usually comes in damaged packages , and sometimes even the products themselves are battered about .
neutral	the flowers were supposed to be left in the porch - particularly as they were left at 0000 !
neutral	the big hamburger has lasted 0_days til now ans is still whole .
positive	excellent shopping_experience , great prices , lovely style clothes , superfast despatch too , well_done boohoo . cheers shaun .
neutral	the post_office informed me that the package was not addressed properly .
neutral	saving_grace is they did manage to get my parcel to me in 00_hrs so the birthday_girl wasnt disapointed .
neutral	they were wrapped in a cellophane just like from a supermarket .
neutral	product does look good .
neutral	well i have to say dpd were as good as their word to me yesterday .
negative	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
negative	the one i have received has at most a 00mm .
positive	i '_ve_used mazuma 0 times and it '_s always been quick and painless .
neutral	although due to the software it took a lot longer and much more effort than_anticipated .
positive	first_class service great quality and the after sales is amazing nothing to much_trouble for this company .
negative	because they are too busy standing around gossiping .
positive	good quality product at a good price .
neutral	delivery date ; 0 emails received over previous 0_days showing the same information with no change to est . delivery date mentioned ?
positive	overall we were really pleased with the quality of the everything and found that the cost ( especially the low delivery charge ) was much_better value than high_street alternatives .
negative	sold my last phone to mazuma and it was all sorted in the space of 0 working_days , so it '_s a no_brainer on who i will be using next time .
positive	absolutly_brilliant service
positive	thanks printzone , you got my repeat_business & i will be spreading the word of your organisation .
neutral	i know you have email but i wanted to talk to customer_services personally .
neutral	it might be more helpful to keep the market place in a different tab on the same page so that you are aware that you are straying onto another site .
neutral	while i almost always get everything i want , there are times when they are out of stock on an item and they have not charged for it , a good thing .
negative	the first person we spoke to said ' yes ' to both of these questions and that they would send email_confirmation .
positive	we found the order process very straightforward , competitive_pricing and very speedy despatch and delivery .
neutral	bearing in mind that the account is paid in_advance and there is very little security in paying by debit_card i was becoming_increasingly worried_about my delivery .
neutral	all in all personal contact with us was very poor .
positive	the web_site is easy to use and when i requested a change to my booking , it was done quickly without_fuss .
neutral	clearly more comfortable with online and telesales .
neutral	i find that whilst the products are good at a competitive price and well_packaged they fall_short on effective communications .
positive	it was close to where our friend '_s wedding_reception was being held ( bawburgh golf_club ) the staff were friendly and helpful .
neutral	always on the phone when you get to the store .
neutral	i sent photos of the faults and was assured i would have a new one delivered .
neutral	but nowadays , when i order online , i expect to receive order updates .
neutral	in limoges you '_ll be told you can '_t have the one car they had spare because " someone might need it !"
neutral	however quality of boxes seems to have fallen recently ( double_sided sticky_tape not properly applied ) and one or two boxes on the outside of the stack are frequently damaged beyond use .
negative	however , i logged in to update a domain i own with them to redirect to a blog , but the domain had gone .
negative	won_'_t use this site again .
negative	0_months_ago i ordered products ( worth 00 gbp ).
positive	chicken casserole - perfect for a winter '_s night after an exhausting day '_s work !
negative	nothing - very unhappy grandchildren have returned home .
positive	very happy with the service .
negative	really spoiled our new year !
positive	my mother - in - law was so pleased with the flowers and chocolates received .
positive	good communication and helpful .
positive	everything has came in excellent order packed great , it took me longer to unpack the board than it did to use it !
positive	the real macoy at discount prices .
neutral	after having my racket for approx 0_weeks and only playing 0 competitive game and only 0 training_sessions the strings snapped during warm up for my 0nd competitive match , expected much more .
neutral	for us , the food is too soft but perfect for someone with no teeth !
neutral	however on the whole when using interparcel itself i '_ve been pretty happy and still continue to use them , but this is definitely due to there being not better option out there for us at this present moment in time .
negative	despite me explaining that surely that wasn_'_t my fault they refused to sell the mirror at the advertised price and i have been forced to contact consumer_direct for advice .
neutral	extreme measures and referral at a high_level through an industry advisor were the only way that i could resolve things - and my thanks go to the high_level complaints executive for restoring my service .
positive	i had an old water_damaged mobile phone that i was going to throw_away but heard about mazuma_mobile and decided to look on their website to see if they accepted broken phones .
positive	the website is easy to use and you get a realistic preview of your sign .
negative	wrote a little message for my mum .
neutral	the jeans were nice and a good quality but the size was very odd .
negative	when i spoke to [_name_] on the phone , she wasn_'_t apologetic at all - just a bit stroppy .
negative	when we turned_up , the company would not rent us the car because we didn_'_t have a second part of of our driver '_s licence .
positive	i ordered two grape_vines for my dad .
neutral	the other items bought are quite good quality .
neutral	o processo de aquisição é simples , mas a encomenda demorou muito tempo a chegar .
positive	their prices were the cheapest by a long_shot , even compared to the january sales in the high_street .
negative	this means i could not do a weeks shopping at once .
negative	the service i received was very good flowers where deliveried as expected and they looked lovely on day 0 by day 0 which was christmas day the roses had died even know we had put them in a clean vase the day before .
neutral	however this was resolved and i was given an additional item f . o . c .
neutral	pictures were of good quality but unfortunately as soon as i opened the calendar i noticed some sheets were already out of the metal coil .
positive	really fast , efficient service from simply baby & free delivery .
neutral	the gift_tag that came with the flowers was barely noticeable and wasn_'_t nicely_presented i think an individual card should be sent that isn_'_t a piece of paper generated off a computer that looks like it '_s an information_leaflet to be disposed of .
neutral	i '_ll definitely be shopping here again for sure , however one of my nail_varnish products did come in the wrong shade .
negative	- so i filled out their online form .
neutral	wrong choice of word , more like extreme disappointment .
positive	highly_recommend .
neutral	this is piece of rubbish pr .
negative	i won_'_t be surprised , if they go the same way as comet , jessops and hmv !

positive	we found the ny_pass very handy to have , and although we possibly did not make as much use of it as we could - in terms of maximising the potential savings - it was just as handy in saving time in queues , particularly at sites such as moma , top of the rock , and the statue of liberty cruise .

neutral	no_problems with hotel information and following instructions for reservation , quick and easy to understand .
positive	what more can you ask a small company to do .
negative	for there error in selling me a second_hand item in the first place .
neutral	from the delivery note it looks_like they were in fact back ordered from a supplier and it would have been helpful to know that at point of order and in this case i would have bought elsewhere because of the urgency .

negative	!
negative	on our outward_trip we found that the choice of a decent breakfast was disappointing otherwise the trip was ok . on our return trip the ferry was late by at_least 00 min although we were told 00_minutes at book in , we were guided to a position on the lorry deck that was walled at both_sides , when we returned we found it almost_impossible to regain access to our vehicle as a very large lorry was places behind us thereby massively reducing the space down each side to get to our car , my wife had to climb a safety barrier to get through , this was completely_unacceptable as my wife has walking difficulties and struggled to gain our rightful access to our car , i am disappointed at the overall service compared to both p_& o and the now_defunct sea_france , i will probably not use your service in future as it by no means compares to p_& o . i consider our experience as being against health and safety guidance and would advise that you seriously review you loading procedures regarding giving safe and adequate access to vehicles parked on all decks
neutral	however although the automated_system for passing through tolls was very convenient the amount charged to my credit_card was very high and i have no information on the makeup of this amount .

negative	appalled or what if viagogo had just charged booking_fee , delivery and vat they '_d have still made a good profit .
negative	that was until they arrived , the delivery driver would not wait_till i had checked them as he said he was a 0rd_party delivery and it would not matter if i rejected them as he would not take them back anyway .
negative	if you want the phone to be put down as having a fault then add that to the drop down box !

positive	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign up numbers , they allowed_us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
positive	the website guided_me to find exactly the ram i needed for my imac , and it '_s an old one so i expected trouble .
neutral	annoyingly , 0 out of the last 0 items i ordered , ( hestre ski_gloves and a salomon origins air ski_helmet ), despite_being shown as in stock in the size / colour i required , turned_out not to be , and they refunded the payments .
negative	the item is faulty ?
positive	someone ( mary ) was available straight_away , very polite and sorted it all out in a couple of minutes .
negative	it took 0_weeks of no action - no emails regarding progress and no reply to my inquiring email .
negative	they refused me a refund because i used a voucher_code ( which they gave_me when i received flowers from them ).
neutral	a trouble_free and pleasant_experience until i met the ' buyer ' of my cartier who reduced the phone quote by £_000 and was so rude , self opinionated and objectionable i was literally on the point of leaving - had it not been for the professionalism of the ' seller ' of the franck muller who saved the day !

neutral	the delivery instructions , i assumed , were in case the recipient was not at home but it would appear that the courier is following delivery instructions without first knocking on door of delivery address to check if recipient is at home .
negative	and that i should receive by the following_monday .
neutral	i ordered a watch for my fiance as a wedding present to give him on our_wedding day .
negative	they stated they had tried to contact me was a blatant_lie as i had been in the the house all day and had no phone_call whatsoever .
negative	people rely_on being_able to get hold of me - today '_s and friday '_s network and website outages are terrible .
positive	£_00 may not seem a lot to some people but to me , it '_s over 0 / 0th needed for injecting a little extra into my investment bond .
positive	i was so pleased with my photo , it was even better_than i had hoped for , i allowed hellocanvas to crop the picture and they sent emails back and forth and showed me the cropped results before_finalising , which was just great for me .
neutral	it may even incur a phone_call as i like to be prepared for a trip and this defeats the object of booking online .
positive	great price , cheapest i could_find online , well recommended .
negative	guess_what ?
positive	easy to use website good value excellent communications
negative	disgusted don_'_t buy from viagogo
positive	webite is excellent and delivery is perfect .

neutral	should i increase kit to 00 mg ?
neutral	we used the online doctor service to obtain the prescriptions which was very quick , efficient and useful .
positive	went on line found good price it couldnt of been any easyer
neutral	however , as soon as i clicked on the link , the 00_%_discount previously offered was gone and instead a free delivery was automatically_applied .
negative	i haven_'_t received , like the other people on this site i have telephoned and sent emails - no response . the phone line just tells you to email them .
neutral	i was happy with product but was no happy because i payed extra for before 00am delivery and they arrived at 00 . 00 i will not use this company again
positive	thank_you for a wonderful service .
positive	prices are very reasonable at the moment , so i hope there won_'_t be any significant price rises in the near_future , otherwise there won_'_t be much difference_between collectplus economy service and royal_mail medium parcel .
negative	!
positive	thanks again :)
positive	saved the day , now looking_forward to our big event .
negative	we are busy processing your account and you will receive an email as soon as it has_been activated .
positive	however what stands_out is ars excellent value for money .
negative	i was quite appalded by this as they had obviously seen me .
negative	they may be slightly_cheaper but the gain is really not worth the hassle .
positive	the financial_advisor was only just contacting us last_week about seeing her illustrations , so we would be at_least a month behind and a dip in the stock market if we had followed this route .
negative	i emailed them and they said they can arrange for the money to be paid back onto my debit_card if i called their customer service .
neutral	not easy to plan for and they have your money !
neutral	although this of good quality material and was marked up a a medium_size , beware it '_s massive !
negative	from the calls i made to follow_up , i gather that the delivery van had broken down , but no - one thought to keep me informed .

positive	altogether an excellent service which i would recommend .
positive	fast delivery
negative	i suspect that i recieved the answer i did from you as i refused the no claims waiver i was offered over the phone .
neutral	half tempted to just say ' f - it ' because the process had taken so long , i held out and went through the entire thing again .
neutral	it was just a shame that the villa wasn_'_t fully_equipped before arrival .
negative	i also made sure someone was home all next_day but still no delivery .
neutral	aldi may be very downmarket , but they are also very cheap .
negative	fine .
negative	on the morning of saturday 00st_december i contacted the company and explained my predicament to the call_handler - i told her the pool_table was for my 0 year_old little_boy '_s main present and i tried everything in power to source another one for christmas .
neutral	phoning trueshopping is a problem due to waiting 00_mins for an answer .
negative	i '_ve written again to complain but i '_m_sure i '_ll have closed by account by the time i get a reply as the service is just so appallingly shocking .

neutral	sadly it was for the wrong items .
positive	" i '_ll be back "
negative	this was one if the worse holidays i '_ve ever had completely miss sold it was told a 0_star hotel was more like a 0 my complaint was brushed under the table will never use these again
negative	had to chase around for a week after a police report which didn_'_t match my phone .
neutral	whist this is ok because the perfume was for me , i wouldnt be 000_% comfortable buying them as gifts as you don_'_t know what the bottle is going to be like unless you open the box .
neutral	however they were rather over - priced at £ 0 . 00 for a tiny box .
positive	so i had no cause for concern as to where things were in the process .
negative	it took two emails to finally get emailed a return certificate .
negative	he was busy but was told he would phone me back in 0 minutes .
negative	i '_m amazed this company stays in business with their delivery service .
negative	the company gave_me a refund minus postage .
neutral	it arrives quick however the couriers so not tale care of your package .
neutral	in fact , the postman kindly called me , as i had requested ( so the message was passed on ), and delivered my item to a neighbour on request .
positive	i did and havent regretted it , it saved me from getting bank charges and i '_d totally recommend then to anyone .
neutral	hi ,
negative	they are getting exspenve i find toolstation .
neutral	how do you even get in touch with them ?
negative	arrived next_day has said but was badly_damaged and high_gloss laquear was full of bits and dust .
negative	three_weeks before a friend '_s wedding day , i ordered some flowers from iflorist to be delivered in the us .

negative	never ever .
negative	oh , and as they have changed me to a super_duper money saving tariff ( pfftt ) i '_m now , stuck with them !
positive	the service swell_pets deliver is excellent .
negative	good luck you lot !
positive	i received a series of bids as well as helpful advice and recommendations that enabled_me to build trust with potential_suppliers and award the business to whom i ocnsidered to the best the service provider .
negative	so very disappointed !!!
negative	well maybe they should .
positive	no_problems with the product or service and outstanding value for money .
neutral	also some of the flowers have only lasted 0_days , which is disappointing .
neutral	this was made known to you at the time , but before it was due to be delivered i received an_email_saying unless i put the old freezer outside ( over one step ) from my porch , then you wouldn_'_t deliver my new one .
negative	he then passed me to the cancellations team to have my account returned to its original status .
neutral	when the service works , its great , when it doesn_'_t , you ' re in the dark .
neutral	ok , so when your washing_machine starts leaking you want to sort it asap .
negative	iwill seek recompense and an explanation before using again
negative	i brought a car from trade_centre wales in may i was there for 0 hours waiting for everything to go through i was late for work because the kept me waiting i got the car in the end and traveled home the next_day i noticed that the windscreen had chips and a crack in it the gear box was banging and crunching the oil light kept coming on even known there was oil in the car the air bag light was on saying inspect so i phoned t . c . w about the problems they told me to bring the car back up so they could have a look so i did i was up there for about an_hour they came out to see me and told me the gear box is knackered i said to them well i now that but what about the other stuff and they said there is nothing wrong with it air bag is fine no oil light on so i questioned them and said so your telling_me there is no fault with the air bag even nowing the airbag light comes on and says inspect and they said yes nothing wrong with it so they told me to bring the car up 0_weeks_later to get it sorted which i was not very happy about because they are trying to let the warrrenty run out i then asked if they will pay for my fuel to get back home and back up as its not my fault the car is knackered they said no we dont do that which really put me over the edge i then said see you in 0_weeks so i then went to see the manager about what the mechanic said to me about the airbag like and all and he said he will get on to them and get back to me i said i am not happy with this car and want to change it remember i only had it 0 days they said no you cant change it even knowing they sold me a car that is broken i then questioned them on the 00 point check about the window and the gearbox as they put on there that it was all fine when it wasnt and they said it was fine when they checked it which i think is a load of bull i waited 0 days for the manager to phone me back and he never so i phoned a number of times and he still didnt phone me back so i reported them to trading_standards all i think they are selling dodgy cars i would stay well away because once you get the car you are totally f_** ked so stay well away they are useless and the managers cant even be_arsed to phone you back which just proves a point they now they have done wrong
positive	it does all it says it does .
negative	scared the wife , scared the kids , but when i tried to report the guy to talktalk , they claimed they had no way of knowing who was working where !
positive	there was no_pressure on me to accept any of the deals .
positive	one happy customer here who will be returning .

positive	couldn_'_t ask for better they made getting a divorce stress_free cannot thank them enough
positive	i '_ve ordered a few_times_now and have never had a problem .
neutral	they were all played and had scratches ( but playback was ok , a couple of clicks ), the guys at chemical didn_'_t let_me know about this was the case in advance which is why they get 0_stars .
neutral	i didn_'_t realise my e_- mail address would be displayed .
neutral	this villa is in an excellent location and was very clean .
neutral	unfortunately , searching for your stock clearly took time and this delayed dispatch .
negative	please do not order anything from this company .
neutral	in fairness to the store they didn_'_t quibble and apologised for the inconvenience .
positive	excellent service ; they kept in constant_touch throughout the order and delivery , and made the whole_experience an enjoyable one for me too !

positive	i signed_up and the next_day i received a freepost_envelope in the mail which i just popped my old_mobile in and sent off .

neutral	a bit of a wait for my kit and the shower chair had a broken weld .
neutral	product took longer_than_expected to be delivered but i understand that this was due to a problem with the supplier .
neutral	the staff were friendly though .
negative	she was actually warned by friends beforehand not to use this service as they had experience problems , but thought that based on our in - store experience , argos was a trustworthy company .
neutral	requested tree > 0 . 00m due to planning requirements as per tree preservation order , once planted only 0 . 0m and this was after ringing to confirm size was acceptable .
positive	as a first - timer i had some reservations_about ordering over - the - counter_medicines online .

neutral	!
negative	" yes dear , i know " i said , " i '_ve called you before and it '_s already been over a week since you signed for my parcel which is a bit over your 0 day rule , so where is my refund ?"

positive	i '_ll be back for more in future .
negative	i was well aware i '_d be offered less because of the mark , which is only visible on a white_background and doesn_'_t affect the operation of the phone , but £ 0 . 00 !!!
negative	mortgage broker used citylink to send back passports , which they aren_'_t insured to carry .
positive	alladins_cave of pens and pencils second to none . superb web_site and delivery system .
negative	after there was something wrong with the payment i called the next_day to pay over the phone .
negative	it seems there have been other problems .
positive	initially i was disappointed to find out that this was not to be supplied by amazon , but via an outlet called bablas who i had never_heard of .
neutral	after taking a day off work to wait in for pram , i had to phone city_link only to be told that delivery had been rescheduled for next_day .

negative	i found this distasteful and it made me and my wife very uncomfortable .
negative	tried e_- mailing the company but everything bounced_back by mailer - daemon - undeliverable quota exceeded .

neutral	i need a waistcoat for a special_occasion .
positive	enjoy .
neutral	i was also disappointed to see that the best before date for the sugar paste was end of april_0000
negative	your parcel has_been delayed '
neutral	in this case , buyers have to wait 00 working_days if the seller refuses to communicate before they can get their money back ; this is in addition to the 0 days the buyer probably waited already before filing the claim .
positive	good site clear pricing delivered on time and very user_friendly .
negative	this was initially repaired directly with samsung as the expansys website advises you to go directly as this will be quicker .

neutral	the shirt isn_'_t pre_- washed or pre_- shrunk , so no tumble drying or it will shrink , " do not dry in sunlight " or it will fade , etc .
neutral	having been ripped_off previously ( by europecar ) i knew better_than to accept their word but i was surprised to find that the car was covered with scratches , some damaged paintwork , a damaged mirror and 0 damaged hubcaps .
positive	great new car .
positive	we will definitely be using them again to add to our collection of fantastic pieces .
neutral	there isn_'_t enough info about the product and they give no guidance that i can see on the exact lengths of short medium and long for trousers etc which makes_life difficult as the models they use are usually 0 ' 00 so the pictures are no help at all .
negative	i refused the offer to return item for refund as the postage was more than the item value , and there is no refund of postage .
neutral	there were many failed_attempts at getting the problem sorted and i got ignored a lot in the process .
neutral	we booked the full day tour .
negative	today '_s date - without warning .

positive	still had to wait 0 0 / 0_weeks for them but with the level and professional service they provided over pervious suppliers i am more than happy to recommend them to other people .
neutral	the tyres seem fine , and the price was good .
negative	later i received a smug email from eflorist informing that the flowers had been delivered on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	would i order again ?
positive	the goods were exactly as ordered and delivered in double quick time , despite beimg in the lead - up to christmas
neutral	product quality was ok but fixing_screws_missing from one box so not checked before dispatch . luckily i had some plugs and screws that i could use but could have been most annoying if i had to go and buy some .
negative	otherwise , i am convinced you are a scam .
neutral	impeccable service from serenata , as usual , and delivered exactly as requested .
positive	a casual take on a cat eye sunglasses shape .
negative	customers should not have to put up with the standards of delivery service offered by nightfreight and i advise people to think again before buying from companies that use this service .
negative	above all , as one of the other_reviewers mentions , why not just use basic business sense and keep all the items in stock by stock checking !
negative	interlink_express have been to my house several_times before but the tracking said that the address could not be found .

positive	what more do you need ?
negative	the manager stated that they do not refund underwear !
positive	these_folks are on the ball - orders are filled quickly and shipping is super_fast .
negative	management at tesco alloa , appalling .
positive	on thursday_afternoon i decided to have a bbq on the friday .
positive	so easy .
neutral	other than that i find the parking costs good value for money .
positive	the site has a huge_selection of all types of pens so its the best site to go to if you are looking for a pen .
positive	happy to recommend .
positive	went from a memory_foam_mattress to a decent pocket_sprung one and can already feel the difference in my back , i '_m now getting a more supported , comfortable sleep .
negative	they did respond to my complaints but only after i sent a registered letter and never accepted any responsibility or agreed to a refund .
positive	previously bought battlefield_0 limited_edition , just bought shogun 0 . cheaper_than steam and instant service . what more can you ask for ?
negative	had booking cancelled due to some security check which they only give you 00hours to comply with ( from a sunday morning in my case ) and then charged me £_00 for absolutely no reason that i can define .
positive	the sunglasses_shop was excellent .
positive	delivery is always on time , the driver is polite and understanding , and they take a number of cards including electron and solo !!!
negative	i am still struggling to believe a huge company , sponsoring a premier_league football_team , can treat people like this when they have cocked_up all along .
positive	i wanted the watch for going on holiday and they made sure it happened .
neutral	however this email arrived addressed to mrs jill carey when actually my name is mrs jill carey - stuart - i hope that any paperwork prepared by your company includes my carrect name or it '_ll have to be sent back !
negative	emailed the hotel back and was told there is no booking for you , contacted alpha_rooms again kept on hold for over 00_minutes there is not a problem the booking is confirmed , emailed the hotel still no booking showing for us , i have rang alpha_rooms again on hold for over 00_minutes at premium_rate , i asked for a call back to confirm everything was in order sorry i have 0 customers in a queue cant call you back well sorry is not good enough i am stressed enough without all this , customer service is appalling , unable to understand the indian service advisor very broken accent , stuck as have paid money and leave in 0_weeks we just wanted a break with our family before my husbands surgery , sort your act out , you should be ashamed of your total_lack of service , i have contacted hotel to see if we have a booking or not i am_disgusted with you
neutral	i then said do you know which customer you are talking to and is it my stuff that has got lost or someone_elses ?
positive	my order arrived exactly as wanted within about 0_days along with regular_updates about delivery time
neutral	when i added on the price of postage and packing it was significantly more_expensive .
negative	they don_'_t care at all , as a seller you have virtually no protection from scams , even if a buyer has a problem with an item mot of the time the seller loses out even_though its not their fault .
positive	thank_you cheapsmells
neutral	the final price was better_than anywhere on the high_street but maybe not by the margins you ' d expect .
negative	cristiano
negative	it is a scam company .
neutral	therefore i had to contact them over and over again , and this caused my package to be delayed by about a week from it arrived in bangkok until i recieved it on the island i '_m staying at , simply because they only gave half informations of procedures , and after days where nothing had happened , i would have to contact them again and again .
negative	i '_ve taken legal_advice and am patiently awaiting their response to my requests both on email and telephoned .
negative	i consider myself a very honest person so this whole situation has left me infuriated ans the money hasn_'_t even reached my account !

negative	the telephone is not answered and they do not reply to e_- mails .
positive	in total it only took one week from order to receipt .
negative	hammonds please do not comment on this asking me to contact you as firstly you have my account details on this review so you could havr easily contacted me if you want to , secondly , you have no_intention of putting my wardrobes right and i am not stuck with them .
neutral	when it arrived there was no lid .
positive	follow - up text_messages kept me informed of my order '_s progress .
positive	i sat in your clean waiting room ( which also had womens magazines !!!!)
positive	thrilled with our rugby ball wash bag , the gentleman is 00 over the bank_holiday_weekend and is a rugby nut and head captain of the local team so he is going to love it !
negative	we eventually took the packaging 00 miles to a recycling centre .
neutral	keen to get your sale .
neutral	easy to order and quick to deliver .
neutral	also the rst of the roses were not of a high_standard relating to the price .
neutral	i am not going to change my shopping behaviour since 00 years , so thanks but the offer has no value to keep me interested shopping further with you .
negative	have used iflorist many_times in the past , but this has put me off big time .
positive	around 0 - 0_days after the courier had collected my laptop i had the money in my account .
negative	they put the phone down on me when i tried to explain about this and their bullying tactics and the reviews that correspond with my report , how unprofessional .

positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
negative	theese guys sell rc nitro cars on ebay and online shopping websites dont buy steer_clear they send you a car it looks all good but . withing 00 minites of running on tickover beacuse it wouldent work any other way the car stopped we re fueled it and then the pull_cord came out with the knot still on the end i had to replace the hub carrier due to it breaking after simply hitting nothing at again 00mph and i asked for a new one after giving them a bad name they siad give us the pictures and change our review i done that and then they started saying there was mud on the images sent and there clearly wasent they then blocked me this is why i am giving them a bad name on here steer_clear of buyrccars on ebay an irish company
neutral	and the faulty first door without the hinge_holes has never been collected .
neutral	overall then : service - vey good !
neutral	receiving the wrong item was an inconvenience - the north_face bags clearly have what size they are on the side , so there was no excuse .
negative	there generic emails are also really unhelpful .
neutral	it is now our policy to call after_placing an order .

negative	asos , it '_s disgusting that you can promote such incompetent idiots to ' senior ' positions who clearly have no understanding about buying and selling regulations within the uk and who refuse to protect their customers when all they have done is purchase in good faith and have used their legal rights when they have received unfit items . the whole episode has cost a lot of time , money and effort and with my wedding day approaching , has only made matters worse with me having to find an_alternative dress in a very short_space of time .
positive	i decided to order the red instead .
negative	btw the car i purchased has also developed a fault since purchase it looks_like the dual mass flywheel is failing and according to people who i have spoken to this would have been noticeable at a service ( which was supposedly done just before i picked_up the vehicle )

positive	order with lenstore for years and absolutely love the service and customer service team very helpful
positive	great website which explains all the technical details in an understandable way .
neutral	contacted extreme_pie by phone who told me that my postcode is classed_as " highlands " ( which we are most certainly not , but this is not the first time this has happened with on - line deliveries .)
negative	avoid them like the plague .
positive	will use the site again in the future .
negative	i did explain to the lady i spoke to that i would be placing an adverse review if not called back , but they didn_'_t bother to call or to offer a solution .
neutral	this has also happened with a previous order .
negative	someone slips up and tells_me who the courier service is .
neutral	few bugs and we don_'_t get the confirmation_email all the time ( even in the spam )
neutral	which are difficult to stop , given to third_parties whom start sending emails etc .
positive	easy to navigate website , prices competitive , fast delivery service
neutral	pad braking with punch brake
neutral	it quite clearly_stated after i paid the total amount requested that the total amount due to hotel was 0 .
neutral	the very nice lady i spoke with said that the system showed the posters had been dispatched by 0nd_class post the day after my order , and promised to send another batch first_class the next_day if they hadnt arrived .
neutral	pharmacy first insisted it had been posted but it never arrived .
neutral	however there was a major problem on delivery , the item i purchased was a 00 year_old gibson_guitar with its original case with a current value of approximately_£ 0000 .
negative	guess their nickname sums their business practice up the best , just substitute a word beginning with " sh " and ending in " ity " for city and you '_ve got it !
negative	was then phoned a week_later and told the same thing .
neutral	i have had it returned and don_'_t want another one as this is a potentially unsafe machine .
neutral	i would recommend cookersandovens but i would also recommend people search the internet for a better deal as my purchase from cookersandovens was due to wanting a specific oven that most others suppliers did not stock .
neutral	however i did expect the item to be boxed .
positive	they kept in touch with me about delivery and it '_s whereabouts throughout it being sent .
neutral	i ordered a new battery for my computer on line .
positive	i never need to worry_about vanilla_pods again .
neutral	website not bad .
positive	received the next_day .
neutral	i always get god service at the high_wycombe branch .
positive	i traded in my well used , but working , iphone .
positive	the glasses are perfect just as_described .
neutral	not very happy .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother to return the game and just kept it , how many other people are like me and can '_t be bothered to complain ?
positive	they can be trusted .
neutral	( go to el cristo beach , 00_mins drive away in estepona ).
negative	do not order from this company .
positive	i recommend it to ex - pats who are marmite addicts and miss some of the other british home_comforts that you can '_t find abroad .
neutral	we got them to stop as they would have caused lots of damage to decor otherwise .
neutral	normally i dont mind him wearing fancy_dress at home but this was a big mistake .
negative	vodafone has a really rubbish customer service and really racist call_center staff .
positive	i am pleased with the shower bath , sink and toilet , they are all very nicely made and the delivery was on time .
positive	so easy and no stress_involved .
positive	lovely furniture ( quercus range ).
positive	the friend who i sent them to was delighted with them and said they were so unusual and the most amazing electric_blue in colour .
positive	thanks guys !
negative	so i emailed their sales_department , and after about an_hour and a half , i asked my husband to phone .
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 i received a delivery from amazon uk ( don_'_t know from which warehouse ).
neutral	owner
positive	we bought standard oak_worktops and matching upstands to give our relatively budget new kitchen a slightly more upmarket feel .
positive	good products , effectively delivered at a the right price .
negative	the response was that it '_s now been cancelled and that their systems show a different collection date .
negative	!
positive	wanted a new mattress and found john_ryan on the web .
neutral	but no .
positive	the tyre was fixed , aligned , balanced and old one disposed at no_hidden or extra_cost .
negative	the sales_assistant asked about protection , and basically wouldn_'_t shut up about it , i wavered and said i think not , and she yelled at me twice " just do it :".
negative	so not quite sure why it is the opposite now !
neutral	maybe better to pay more and go eleswhere ?
neutral	i was impressed with how quickly the package was delivered and the cost was so much_cheaper , but when it was delivered the box it came in was damaged and the contents boesx was all damaged and open .
neutral	very expensive for not many flowers
neutral	i give 0_stars for quick delivery but only 0_stars for quality of the glasses so on average 0_stars .
negative	so my daughter will_certainly not be spending her money with them .
neutral	nice easy website to use and can see what you have paid for and when it has_been paid etc .
neutral	the mattress arrived in perfect_condition , however it arrived the day after we expected it , with no notice of the late arrival , luckily there was someone available in the house .
neutral	!
positive	delivery time is short and tracking_details keep you updated about your oder .
positive	i bought a ' judge ' milk frother , as i '_m a latte freak and the coffee shops are getting a little too expensive for my taste .
positive	on arrival in spain we were greeted_by local rep from the marbesol car_rental company .
neutral	very disappointed .
negative	or at the very least – if you want it in a hurry , for a specific reason , for a specific date ?
neutral	i could maybe write a review if i had been able to use the service on a website that was up and running , but due to problems outwith my control the site has taken over a week to go live .
positive	at this price i can have different pairs or sunglasses and still get them cheaper then i would have for one pair on the high_st , great result !
positive	for the past 00 years i have had a vauxhall car , but this time my husband said let ’_s have a look around for something different , so we did , we looked at about 0 different makes of car , then we went to chorley_nissan , and we were treated like customers we looked at 0 different_models , and we test drove them all , the salesman his name was brian had all the time in the world for us , he answered all our questions .
positive	many_thanks
neutral	vodafone , if you ' re listening , you need to go back to the drawing_board and work on your customer service !
negative	firstly , icuk are a bt reseller .
neutral	the fabric i consequently ordered was sent out in the wrong fabric .
positive	juicer exactly as_described and so_far has performed as expected .
negative	steer_well clear and use a proper collections agent .
negative	i am very very stressed about the whole_thing and i certainly cannot recommend this company .
neutral	best advertised price for what we wanted but an additional compulsory booking_fee of £ 0 . 00 when you get to the end of the process makes it not quite as good as the ad !
neutral	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it '_s unlikely you '_ll receive a response .
neutral	it has_been 0_months now and this kafkaian situation still_hasn_'_t been solved with my bank saying they never received the money because the credit_card was canceled and travel_nation saying that they already processed the refund .
positive	exceptional prices and service , can '_t even try to pick a fault with these_guys !
neutral	+ ve
positive	i needed a lot curling ribbon and parytrama had exactly the colours i wanted at the right price too . the photos on the web_site displayed the colours accurately and my order was quickly dispatched .
neutral	lots of minor_damage and scrapes which i was expected to observe and ensure were recorded prior to taking car . made me uneasy that i might be charged later for unnoticed damage . and believe me the car was very carefully examined upon return !
negative	i asked to speak to the manager and complained .
positive	i ordered on a monday and they came the next_day , well_packaged , delivery costs are are sensible and honest .
neutral	i had two messages on my cellphone to confirm order and two messages on the email .
negative	i suggest you think very carefully before parting with any money to this company .
negative	they don_'_t warn you in the text that the call is not part of your free mobile minutes but actually a premium_rate mobile number that will cost you a fortune while you ' re sat on hold or going through the menus .
neutral	wohoo !
negative	0 ) the snow was over by then .
negative	however didn_'_t indicated that this is a glitch - its ' simply the way it '_s set_up .
positive	the policy was very simple to set_up and very competitively_priced .
positive	once i had returned home , a 000 mile_journey , i noticed a door protector was missing from a front_door , a quick phone_call later and they were happy to reimburse me the cost , it was a 00 second job to fit it .
negative	!
neutral	the shipping rates are way too high !
positive	good transaction no_problems
negative	only then i would have been entitled to terminate the contract without paying termination charges .
negative	this is excessive , and i shall not be using rentalcar again .
neutral	she reluctantly said she would release the laptop .
positive	go on treat_yourself !
positive	i ordered 0 clocks and a trophy .
positive	thanks toolstop .
neutral	my wife is 0 feet tall so i don_'_t know what would have happened if i wasn_'_t there .
negative	one of your staff did take the trouble to search the stock shelves , he informed me that he had found the last set in stock .
negative	things went well until we got to arranging when i was going to get the loan .
positive	garment was fantastic .
negative	day before i get a call and email_saying they cant deliver it - blaming the manufacturer .
negative	twice !
positive	i have used quite a few cd_key websites and without a shadow of a doubt simplycdkeys is the best out there by far !
negative	ordered items on the 00th_august_0000 .
neutral	the delivery address was a business address on a busy main_road , the driver just left them there .
positive	i would definitely refer a friend !
negative	it seems they split the company so one side can blame the other , i mean how do you loose a parcel for 0 days and then make the customer fight for any kind of refund , instead of a refund they kick you whilst your down ?
negative	what you might save money wise originally you will lose on the project delays , having to get people back on site .
positive	the quality has always been excellent .
positive	i would recommend .
neutral	called local centre for price to compare with web .
negative	i then called to talk to the manager .
negative	for my aunties_00th they delivered it 0_days early and this left me a little deflated .
neutral	keep sending me junk_mail but their penion is quite good
neutral	usually the first place i look at when buying cables .
positive	arrived when said and the men put it in the room i wanted it in with no problem , they were both polite .
positive	the bean_bags that we ordered are exactly_what we wanted .
negative	changed my packaging as well
positive	only very good products at a very good price .
negative	we always ended_up with a fight on our hands as they consistently state they never received notification of the contact cancelling so you end up paying for numerous extra months .
positive	very good quality , and fit in beautifully in their new surroundings .
positive	what really stood_out was the great email communication , i was never left_wondering the status of any enquiry .
positive	good value for money .
positive	i ordered medicines for my cat on saturday and received them on tuesday which saved me a trip to the local_vets and a lot of money as much_better service and prices .
negative	flowers delivered to wrong_address , dumped over the gate and no effort made by carrier to verify correct recipient .
neutral	removable tow_bar fitted in time advised .
negative	however , after making my purchase i did not receive any communication from this site .
positive	after we ' d ordered we changed our_minds and called to amend .
negative	the tyres they sold me were very dangerous & the fitting_station they recommended was rubbish .
positive	they were even helpful when i couldn_'_t find my voucher_code .
positive	best if you can place a sizeable order to get delivery free as well !
positive	will buy there more because it '_s so cheap !
neutral	on returning the car all went very smoothly i '_m pleased to say .
negative	even ebay realizes there are scammers about !
neutral	i
neutral	you are expected to provide suitable packaging - which is quite important as if the phone is damaged in transit it will seriously affect how much you receive .
negative	how is this possible - their shipping label was attached to each parcel - but they ignored this and sent them both to the opposite address .
neutral	the car was great - clean and good quality - but £_00 a day for an additional driver was excessive on the cost of a week '_s hire and £ 0 a day for a booster cushion was a rip_off - we drove to the nearest tesco and bought one for £_00 .
neutral	at_least we didn_'_t order the lunch which would have been rushed in the time given .
negative	went to a much_better company and got next_day delivery .
neutral	seen there has_been a few different feedbacks about damaged goods , maybe they should change courier and make experience for customer better .
neutral	previous experience has always been better .
negative	nutshell - avoid this company !
neutral	everything_went perfectly .
neutral	i haven_'_t tried either yet but it '_s true to state that they look as if they will be fit for purpose .
neutral	the car should be available with a minimum amount of petrol and then it should be up to me how much petrol to put in the car .
negative	i '_m stuck with a mattress i don_'_t want and still_waiting for my price difference .
positive	the rope lights were bought to be installed along out yard walls , the order only comes with one pack of clips , so you need to by a few more .
negative	after ringing the extortionate customer service line , i was politely told that i had been misinformed by the shop and that i was on a 00 month business deal and had to pay £_000 to cancel it .
neutral	i would strongly_recommend that flowers are left with a neighbour or taken back and re - delivery is tried later .
neutral	lots of info on the website about next_day delivery etc , but by the time the order is placed and paid for - only then do you find out ' delivery in 0 - 0_weeks '.
negative	i called 0 . 00 and the man said someone would call by 0 .
positive	i was very impressed with all the clothing items , but unfortunately the shoes were too_narrow to fit my son '_s feet , so i returned them .
negative	yodel has no_problems leaving packages in my back garden when no one is at home , which is usually the case .
neutral	i thought i was paying for them when i checked out on rentcars . com .
negative	if you are not in a rush and don_'_t mind not knowing where your items are coming from then they are a great place to buy from but i prefer clarity when i spend my money on what i would consider as a medium priced order .
positive	those bars were easy to fit , and look great , mind you , i '_m still fiddling with cables and hoses to get a nice run .
positive	i '_ve bought four different machines from them and i '_ve never been disappointed .
positive	you can '_t get better_than that .
negative	which year are they actually intending to pay the debt they owe me ?
positive	no need to make appointments .
negative	this site is disgraceful , i got no help and should have been offered some kind of refund or at_least my £_00 postage returned back to me . at the very least !
positive	they regularly have some great bargains and i know that i can expect my purchases more promptly than most stores in the u . s . a . ( and a good many here in canada ).
positive	the list they offer was superb - far more than most suppliers .
neutral	excellent base , plastic shaped very well indeed .
neutral	so when he sent me the improved ( or so i thought ) spec i questioned_why he had put on it an older graphics_card ( gtx 000 instead of gtx 000 0gb ) he said the 000 would perform better .
neutral	so i paid double .
positive	may book again .
neutral	the prices are very much average with little deals .
neutral	would definitely go back .
negative	it started off when my partner took my car to simply have a tyre changed .
negative	not delivered !!!
positive	the quality of the grain and seeds that i received was top_notch and even a bag clip was included - the packaging was perfect as well and the delivery very quick .
neutral	in the past i '_ve found that sizes usually wear half a size more than they claim .
positive	ecco boots are more than comfortable and this season the models are also quite up to date .
negative	and since it takes around 00 days to get a gp appointment it kind of all defeats the object really !
negative	i '_m_glad to be rid of them and their dubious business model .
positive	thank u mazuma :_d
neutral	was not given the option to have same day delivery even_though advertised .
positive	thank_you !
positive	many_thanks .
negative	two color and 0 b / w . all 0 b / w cartridges turned_out to be empty !!!
positive	brought two whs tyzeck products off tooledup . com . fantastic product , brilliant service , delivery etc .
positive	ring quality 000 out of 000
negative	damaged drawers on delivery - after sending 0 0 separate incorrect drawers out in very poor packaging , it is still not resolved .
negative	i haven_'_t received my delivery !
negative	receipt for the payment .
positive	she now has centre stage in the front_garden and is settling well .
negative	didn_'_t you think i '_d notice .
negative	surprise_surprise nothing heard .
positive	orders are dealt_with swiftly and accurately and the on - line news_letters are always attractive and interesting .
positive	i was really pleased with the beautifully made shawl i bought for my new grandson , so soft .
neutral	felt like they only care for customers who are able to make a claim , if nothing come out of that , customers are not very important .
positive	absolutely_brilliant service , great communication via_email and the price i paid is the best i could_find online .
positive	delighted with the products i ordered for my parents_diamond_anniversary party they arrived days early and are just what i wanted , thanks .
negative	for as long as i live i will never in my life buy energy from this company no matter_how low their prices are !
negative	made one order and cancelled my account straight after .
negative	funny that i can '_t get a refund on an item that i don_'_t have , haven_'_t signed for and up to the point of delivery is not my property by law !
negative	the vauxhall garage pulled_out the cd_player , noticed something stuck inside it and pulled_out the object .
neutral	they were quick to respond to quires through emails but had no contact_numbers .
neutral	the collect_+ couldn_'_t read the screen on my phone and struggled to do the process , it ended_up taking 00_minutes .
neutral	again , this was also rectified through the good work of the call - centre .
neutral	one of 00 pc without gloss coating , it is not up to my expectation .
positive	altogether an excellent product at a surprisingly reasonable price .
negative	when i called to complain i was told i now have to give the delivery company 00 working_days to sort it out !!!
negative	shame as there are probably a few good entrepreneurs around but this experience has made me think_twice and i tend to get better value and less hassle sticking to the bigger_players now .
positive	very prof company was disappointed item purchased did not fit . poss more my fault than company . will not_hesitate to order other items for my cavapoo aj
negative	bought over £ 0 , 000 worth of goods from argus over last 00 months but they have now lost a customer !!
neutral	i personally prefer to eat small meals other than the main_meal of the day .
positive	good overall service within tyreshopper , who sorted the problem with there tyre repair company .
negative	i didn_'_t have much mail in the course of being a customer but when i did , customer '_s cheques didn_'_t arrive and had to be cancelled and other mail also never made it .
positive	single , easy to follow and reliable !
negative	i then demanded to speak to a manager where he then put the phone down .
neutral	after 0 telephone_calls ( 0 of which were cut_off ) i finally found someone_who was able to help and talk things through with me .
neutral	i live only 00 miles north of glasgow and am in central_scotland .
positive	great service thanks !
negative	and being told the transport would be 00 - 00_minutes almost two hours_later it finally arrived with the comments that the guy_who took my phone_call had turned off the fones so they went to answer phone .
neutral	this would be a useful feature for them to add in future .
positive	they are really easy to fit , are great value and do their job in protecting the boot from damage / soiling .
negative	i want my money back and i want compensation .
positive	ordered my rear breaking system from jk the service was brill very well_packed very quick delivery sensibly_priced a0 .
negative	i have a suggestion where they can shove their priority tickets .
negative	regards
positive	good prices too !
positive	online customer service was very helpful and easy to use !
neutral	when arrived good service .
neutral	had i purchased this in person from a shop it would have gone back straight_away .
neutral	i ordered 000 so will use them up but not sure if i will reorder .
positive	well happy !
positive	even down to the deliver time being spot on
negative	anyway , i will now leave them and go_elsewhere as it was dangerous to leave a lone female at night on a busy_road and just bull *** her about policy to avoid any form of help !
negative	!
neutral	i think , the website should have a preview on everything considering the amount each customers spends .
negative	they would not let_me lodge a complaint after 00_mins on the phone , and said they would call me every day until i agreed to close it , well i won_'_t .
negative	0nd delivery date 00nd_april_0000 un available
neutral	my recent order for several cables was delivered promptly and the packaging was excellent .
neutral	if they had a proper refund policy i am sure their sales would increase .
neutral	for the flowers to be left_outside the front_door after not waiting was unacceptable , as clear_instructions were given to leave them with the next door neighbour if the recipient was not in .
neutral	disappointed the first time i have used this firm , an offer for bridgestone_tyres at discounted_price of £_00 from £_000 and the order cannot be fulfilled - that makes me not impressed at all
positive	the recipient was pleased . what more could a customer ask for ??
neutral	very good service over the years
negative	definitely wouldn_'_t recommend , avoid at all costs !
negative	any member of stoneacre company can contact me at any time to sort this out .
positive	kept up to date on delivery schedule .
negative	this is not customer service and its certainly not something i '_m willing to pay for month on month .
positive	what '_s more the cologne was delivered in the time frame stated .
negative	they can '_t .
positive	very helpfull when you have a enquiry and friendly .
neutral	not the cheapest can buy same quality elsewhere cheaper
negative	i sent countless_emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
positive	i would just like to say that shopping with very is so straight_forward that any one can do it .
negative	the chat person said she was talking to multiple customers and after 00_minutes said she would pass my concern to the concerns dept .
negative	i explained the situation to this manager who kept telling_me i had ' assumed ' and i should have called to clarify .
neutral	waste of time and money .
negative	they emailed about the order would take about two_weeks to arrive .
positive	flavours are amazing taste great .
positive	very happy +++++++++++++++
negative	ordered again the same . nearly a week_later refunded on both_occasions . what is the point !
negative	brilliant !
positive	all were delighted .
positive	i really was very impressed !
positive	i accidentally gave the wrong prescription when i first ordered the glasses , but managed to return them with no_fuss , and had another pair sent out - which are both the right prescription and fantastic .
neutral	they say they have tried to deliver when they haven_'_t , they say they '_ve put a card through the door when they haven_'_t , and all for deliveries that do not require a signature and for which a safe location to leave the parcel has_been specified .
negative	the laptop that arrived must have been an old one which was extremely large and heavy .
positive	the only down - side being that all communication is by e_- mail and post and since i don_'_t necessarily access these media on a daily_basis it caused a delay in receiving the goods .
negative	i '_m completely disappointed by the service .
neutral	apparently first package was lost in the post .
positive	lækre sko til god_pris .
neutral	when he went up i could see he had a loose shoelace and pointed it out as i did not want him to trip on it , but he just shrugged and said it didn_'_t matter .
negative	avoid they only want your money !!
neutral	the bags took three_days to arrive which made the delivery on a friday so it turned_out i wouldn_'_t receive any correct new bags until the following_monday or tuesday , this was not an option as i already had orders to deliver that weekend so i had to use the wrong bags they had sent me anyway .
neutral	the full details of our experience is outlined in my letter to dfds of 00th_july .
negative	!
negative	what a dinosaur !.
negative	my partner queried_why the charge could not be over looked due to loyalty and the fact he had been paying for a internet_connection he hadn_'_t used for about 0_months .
neutral	would be nice to be refunded or given a realistic date or better still delivery me what i purchased . always had a good service previously so hope this isn_'_t a slippery slope they are on !
neutral	i would use marinestore again as this was the only issue however not if i needed something quickly or at this time of year .
neutral	i recieved packaging after registry about 0 days_later .
negative	i contacted them and they said it had been sent , but it clearly had not .
negative	in 0 0 / 0 years we lost £ 0000 with not a godamn thing to show for it , as a result of this company '_s ignorance , contempt and utter arrogance .
positive	shop_here with confidence .
negative	funny how that changed when one of their delivery drivers walked in on our heated discussion , and asked her why was it such a problem when all he had to do was walk out the back and get it .
neutral	they had my number and no effort to try and call if they could not find it !
positive	aside from the easy to use website and good delivery service the price was considerably better_than everyone_else .
positive	item was in stock , the price was lower_than most other official dealers and the order was sent the same day .
neutral	it seems matters then got a little out of control .
positive	i would definitely order from trading_depot again and would recommend them without_hesitation .
positive	we have come to depend_upon swell_pets to deliver great value food for our dog and importantly it always arrives in one or two_days which the dog is very happy about
positive	i read a few of the reviews and felt_confident to make my purchase .
neutral	purchase and delivery went very smoothly .
negative	i placed an order for 0 items on 0 april_0000 , it '_s now 00 april & i haven_'_t received my order yet .
negative	i inherited this company as a utility provider when moving in to a new house .
negative	trolled through the " so called " sale offers - mainly 0nd_hand stuff that was almost full price with amazing 00_%_off !!
positive	a great price and unbelievable service .
positive	brilliant hightly_recommended
positive	' don_'_t know who to contact ?
neutral	a couple more days passed , and nothing arrived .
positive	its not often you get a delivery before the expected date but with my order from fancy_dress ball it was delivered 0_days before it was expected .
neutral	very impressed with serenata - had never_heard of them before and what i liked is that they kept informing_me as to the progress of the delivery .
positive	i ordered 0 bottles of perfume - a lot_cheaper_than_anywhere_else i have looked .
neutral	failed to inform_me that they were not going to send that one item .
negative	!
positive	since_discovering them i have had new glasses , sunglasses and now order my contact_lenses with them , all at brilliant prices . i '_ve also recommended them to friends and family !!!
neutral	i ordered the gorgeous blue orchid bunch , only i got a text around 0am saying that theyd been loaded_onto the van and were on route . i waited around all day and didn_'_t receive them until after 0pm . but hey what do you expect for free delivery . when they arrived they they were not only a disappointingly small bunch compared to the picture of them on the internet but many of the delicate leaves were scorched and shrivelled from the heat in the van .
positive	really good value for money too .
neutral	service companies who receive monies for supplying a service should be accountable for checking the information they supply and confirming correctly to the client - not shrugging it off as not their fault .!
positive	the delivery was perhaps a little more pricey than amazon but the service was excellent with dpd , their couriers , involving a live webpage of where my parcel was on its journey .
negative	and will only give you 0 year renewal periods so you have to pay double ( they are noted in the industry as being horrendously expensive at renewal )
negative	they would not publish it untill there customer service team have spoken to me .
neutral	it eventually arrived the day after that - but they sent a black one !
positive	very easy and simple to use money returned within a 0 days of sending the phone off
negative	i then tried_calling back the number that appeared on my mobile but it rang then cut me off .
negative	i informed them that the guy fixing the tiles was arriving the next_day and that i could put him off until 00 am but unlike most professionals in the building industry he actually turns_up when he states .
negative	when things go ok its fine .
neutral	00 days_later i wondered what had happened as i had not received any updates so i looked at the website to see if there was any information .
positive	a great firm to deal with .
negative	decided that i would wait for the estimated delivery date .
negative	" i appreciate that you are going to be on an exchange in that case the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
positive	i know this item ( a software licence ) can be tricky , because of the manufacturer not always being on the ball .
negative	i joined and i bought aa insurance .
neutral	i have a disability and have been left on a few occasions at the airport for up to 00_minutes trying to contact for delivery .
negative	often the cheapest option on screen but in reality you end up paying more - they may come in £_00 - 00 cheaper_than bmi baby / british_airways etc but once you work out all the costs they won_'_t be & even if they are its just such a miserable way to start a trip .
neutral	they involve everyone in the room .
negative	one lot arrived but the others didn_'_t .
negative	waste of my time .
positive	now i just buy refills .
positive	good price / fast fast delivery / all good .
positive	one of the most reliable web_sites we use
neutral	would consider a different company when buying again !
positive	thanks
positive	the only_slight_problem i had was that no one responded at all to my two requests for clarification sent well before 00pm the day before delivery .
positive	cannot_fault quality or service .
positive	thats how good jules_b is .
negative	this caused me immense inconvenience and ruined a weekend ( it was a birthday_gift for a friend ).
negative	i had read about the 00 minute pick_up on jessops site and had then ordered through jessops_photo .
negative	i will however do my utmost to ensure that all my business and mail contacts do not get caught out by these_people and will approach local_newsagents to remove their future catalogues from papers if my refund doesnt appear .
negative	delivery did not come until after 0pm by which time i had left for work .
negative	waste of time , should have used amazon or walked to the shop , will not use again , do not recommend .
positive	in future i will look no further .
neutral	even_though it looked well_packed , when we came to open it , it had been twisted , presumably during_transit .

negative	0 jan_0000 00 : 00 : 00_pm cambridge_cambridgeshire gb out for delivery
neutral	however , my biggest disappointment with the presentation was that part of the labelling on the bottle was missing .
neutral	the product i ordered was poor quality and quite_expensive so was disappointed with that , but delivery and service was fine
positive	the availability of the unit was great as many places had to order it in , the price was also very competitive .

positive	really simple process to get the ' ticket ' and i found a parking_space very quickly .
negative	he was authorised to do this and said that the money would be transferred on friday 00th .
negative	when i called the customer service department the operator made me feel like i was stupid not knowing that i would have to pay the remaining_balance on the day at the hotel at the exchange_rate given by the hotel .

neutral	i am a competent_diyer but i was not able to assemble the wardrobe in the one hour time allocation . 0 days_later i have finally just got the doors on !

positive	this was a tricky one as i am in portugal and the company is in the uk .
positive	i was really impressed with the range of products .
positive	their customer service is outstanding , this is something you need when making such an expensive purchase !
positive	on both_occasions , service was prompt and efficient .
neutral	this really isn_'_t good enough .
negative	when order came , driver wanted me to sign before he had taken the goods off the lorry without_any inspection .
positive	although , products were not up to my expectations , which was down to the supplier but they refunded me the full_amount immediately and asked me to even keep the items .
negative	will not use them again .
negative	i emailed them a week_ago and they guaranteed my new ps0 would be here by monday .
neutral	only issues i ever had were post delivery charges .
positive	i could not fault this service at all .
neutral	regardless of where that store was located it was based on where the head_office was located and their weather that day !
positive	if you need cables , adapters , and connectors this is the place to look . i get service and good value .
neutral	waited over three_weeks for part of my order .
neutral	what actually happens is the car checkers work for all the companies so you can use any lane .
positive	again amazing service . so fast from contact to recieving_cheque just 0 working_days thanks again mazuma
neutral	one item was missing . when i put the order in it said low stock . and the item did not arrive , so i worked out they didn_'_t send it and lucky refunded me for the item without having to ask .
neutral	come on ba get your act_together , i am_afraid that qantas really have the better customer service than you at the moment .
negative	000 - reg recently_bought .
positive	every time i look at it i see something i had not previously noticed .
neutral	i eventually got my cashback and wasn_'_t told i would pay a £ 0 admin_fee :-( so that was a little_disappointing .
negative	although the guernseys were nice , i would never use this company again , because of the major fault with their website concerning next_day delivery .
positive	i had a set of wire wheels , to be fitted with inner_tubes and white wall edges for tyres , manager fitted them letting staff watch and learn !!!
neutral	when hdnl tried to deliver and i wasn_'_t home , they took it away and left a calling_card .
positive	ik_heb al jaren lang ervaring met diertotaalservice .
negative	i have spoken to the merchants directly and they have confirmed they have paid topcashback , so they are sitting on the money and simply refusing to pay it to me and keeping it for themselves .
negative	payment was taken at the time of order .
negative	i was originally told they would try and find me some other tickets - this was never taken up and on the day of the concert when i was still_waiting to receive my tickets i was simply told i would have to get a refund .

negative	service parfaitement honteux de_la part de_la maison dior .

negative	on contacting the company , my husband was told that it was in their small_print that flowers could be delivered on an_alternative date if the company so decided and that a refund was out of the question .
negative	i '_m pretty sure that i will not bother trying to do this again even_though i have been a loyal_customer of yours for the past 00 years .
neutral	it still took 0_days to be delivered .
neutral	if it takes a year each time based_upon my age of 00 id say they may get another 00 purchases out of me if they ' re lucky !.
negative	after telling_me that my prescription was out of date and not giving me time to get a new one , they charged me £ 0 . 00 admin_fees and £ 0 . 00 bank charges .
positive	the fitting_centre were very quick and pleasent .
negative	the other three nights the service was sloppy .
negative	i have been with vodafone over 0 years . and not been happy with the bills , customer_services and generally the whole company !!

negative	i await your urgent reply .
negative	very bad customer service .
negative	appallingly shocking !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	the service i have received is appalling .
negative	i then sent them an email asking them to confirm that the order and payment had been cancelled , but received no reply .
neutral	his advice was sensible , he could have fixed it ( but not on the spot ) but his honest advice was to buy a new machine .
neutral	saying that the service was super quick , communication good and when they realised they couldn_'_t do it a full_refund was offered without hassle .
negative	if it doesn_'_t work the first time . its not going to work the 0th or 0th .
neutral	0 hours after activation i re - entered the caravan expecting to see dead insects and crawlers but only found live ones who seemed un bothered with the very small_amount of smoke produced by this product .
negative	if the case looks like it might be a bit_tricky and might have to be worked at then they dont take it on .
negative	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today '_s booking hasn_'_t turned_up .
positive	they kept me informed_throughout the manufacturing process and did not charge me until the item was ready for despatch .
negative	on 00th_january , i sent yet another email , with the subject line as hello is anybody there ?

positive	email confirmation came immediately .
neutral	it appeared one office didn_'_t talk to the other .
positive	normally competitive and always delivered on time .
negative	we '_ll call you tomorrow .
negative	to my astonishment i eventually discovered that you had had the correct item in for weeks but were waiting for the incorrect item to be collected and returned before sending it out .
positive	i mainly bet on football and horse_racing and just about every market i need is on there .
positive	i have to promise to my customers that i will deliver on time so i need to book through a professional service , having tried most of the competition i can say undoubtedly that parcel_monkey is the top of the tree for reliable outstanding service , first and every time !
neutral	sadly my product hasn_'_t arrived but in fairness this isn_'_t the normal service from pet_supermarket .
negative	eventually_managed to find an_alternative phone number on facebook and was able to talk to staff .
negative	we didn_'_t see any vehicles coming away from the airport towards looking0parking and believe we would have definitely missed our plane .
positive	i rang helpline for advice before my 0st order and found the sales_person i spoke to very helpful .
negative	just to start off , i only selected 0_star because you had to choose , otherwise it would be - 00 .
negative	then also get told that the car that was selected and paid for was not available .
positive	nonetheless , i made my order via the worktop_express website because it was easier to use than ebay .
positive	i '_d recommend them to everyone !

neutral	seems fine to me .
positive	navigating it was fine , and the confirmation emails reassuring .
negative	i felt so excited for my nana , as it was going to be a complete surprise for her , i now feel so let_down !!
positive	really good quality .
negative	after discussion with a manager i finally got them to let_me return the nest for free as i had not just changed my mind about the purchase but the coffee and nest were bought for the one room and one without the other was pointless .
positive	the ordering_process itself was hassle_free and the product arrived as_described
positive	excellent service all_round .
negative	this experience - rescheduled online for saturday delivery .

negative	ordered from them on the monday_night and received my glasses on the thursday_morning .
negative	it is little wonder_why yodel is receiving such poor customer feedback if this is the lack of investment the head_office has made across the group .
neutral	i have therefore persevered with the batteries but one has now died completely .
positive	great looking , comfortable bar_stools at an amazingly_low price .
neutral	so i started building it again only to discover the same problem .
positive	brilliant after a long and tiring flight .

positive	!
negative	the customer service did not act as we had another terrible return_journey on the return crossing , since returning home i have complained to d f d s no reply up to now thank_you d f d s tom duffy .
neutral	the result was that i lost approx 00_% of the contents of the cleaning_fluid which spilled all over the rest of the items in the consignment making them all soggy and destroying all of their cardboard packaging and any instruction leaflets .
positive	kiwi fit came to change the tyres in our car at a time that suited_us .
neutral	if you buy the blue stripey jobs in tesco then talktalk is your type of company but if you prefer to spend the extra on tesco_finest then it isn_'_t .

positive	i would definitely use it again and recommend it to others .

negative	ordered on 00 / 00 / 00 , paid extra for special delivery and payment taken immediately .
neutral	it is a shame as with a bit more thought it could have been excellent .
negative	just a rude women on the end of a phone basically saying its not her problem .
negative	went_onto facebook to ask for an update , apparently a field was left blank so delivery could not be made ( my fault , which i accept ) - however , no contact from thornton '_s or delivery company advising me of this , i had to chase them .
neutral	also , inevitably , you do not return the car empty .
neutral	quick delivery , good value

positive	brillian company , quick and efficient , will_definately recommend them .
negative	disappointed !

neutral	secondly , after explaining to the man on the phone that the furniture was for me , somehow the items still ended_up being titled to my fiance !
positive	ordered for a friends birthday late_sunday_evening , delivered promptly tuesday_morning as requested we were kept_fully_informed as to the status of our delivery by text and available on line .
positive	this company sells the best products , i have tried other locally sourced supplies but they are never as good .
negative	i have emailed customer_services voicing my complaint along with a picture of the flowers and asking how they are going to resolve the matter .
neutral	booked for myself and husband , could not fault the way the transaction was carried_out but really shocked with the cost of the tickets , face value of tickets £_00 each paid in total £_000 .
negative	they don_'_t seem to be able to deliver when their website promises and they don_'_t seem to be aware of their broken_promises .

positive	well_done white &_bishop .
neutral	prices are unbeatable tho

positive	good price , fast delivery , what '_s not to like ?
negative	delivery date came but no goods .
positive	having used webtogs for sometime now , i have seen their consistancy in excellent customer service and that makes a huge_difference for me when choosing an online_retailer , but not only do they keep this level of support , but they also show the same consistancy on other levels , their communications via the social medias , and of course their competitive_prices . if they were to provide a wider scope of hiking_gear ( watches , tools ), then i would be happy to use them as my sole provider for everything outdoors
neutral	the flowers came on time , i expected more of a fuller bunch but you can '_t expect much at such low_prices
positive	i dealt_with james johnson , nice manner , very professional and helpful .

neutral	most white_van men are now giving 0 hour delivery windows .
negative	after shopping with them for years and having things sent to my work all this time , i placed a order last_week , they rejected it because my address had 0 letter different ( 0a rather_than 0 , 0a is actually correct but they only accept the incorrect_address ).
neutral	these were presents , and not packed tightly enough .
neutral	eventually they consented to sending the package again .
negative	i then received a revised_offer from bozowi of £_000 with them stating : ' engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a significant scratches on the unit or screen that does not meet the minor wear and tear criteria .

neutral	i once again tried to log in and have met nothing but problems .
negative	if you send flowers you need to know they are going to get there .
neutral	soon as the pallet gets knocked in transit they have all leaned forward ripping all the boxes and scratching some of the tiles .
negative	amazon tracker ;
neutral	offer insurance with a reasonable excess to start with .
positive	would buy from again .
neutral	the vase supplied had hardly_any water and the water that was there was old and had bits of foliage floating in it .
negative	i booked a flamenco dancer in june as a surprise for my sisters party at the end of july .
negative	and what kind of person_who receives those flowers would say to the sender that they are horrible ; not a british person , that '_s for sure , we ' re just too polite .
neutral	i ring .
negative	promised an email on a one day with a revised_offer and did not come through to the next_day .
negative	at_least on other platforms they tell you the fees upfront .
positive	a few_days_later email arrived , placed order and saw arrived next_day .
neutral	took well over an_hour .
negative	on ebay the item had showed 000 sold . not for that price .
positive	no_problems and exactly_what i needed .
negative	at 00 : 00 the same day hermes tried to deliver my parcel even after they have been told not to .
neutral	after a couple of trial small booklets , i was very satisfied with the quality of the images inside my latest a0 book .
neutral	the flowers were beautiful - possibly the best i have bought my wife - however they arrived in a soggy box as the water had somehow leaked in transit . so much so that the accompanying card was barely readable .
negative	i then had to return it and get proof of doing so . that was on the 0rd_june , it is now the 00th and they still wont confirm they have had it back because they are returned somewhere_else . load of b * llocks .
negative	great business model they have !
neutral	i really do like using amazon as it is cheap , has quick deliveries to the north_east of scotland ( and doesn_'_t charge you extra for it ) and the products are of a very good quality . but . what is not helpful is the use of the market place in amongst all the amazon things .
positive	would recommend to anyone who needs a reliable supplier of contact_lenses
positive	the guide book you get with it is great .
positive	i use lenstore for purchasing my contact_lenses .
neutral	so , in summary , a promising looking product , but from my experience , don_'_t expect any urgency from yale if anything_goes_wrong post installation !
negative	i was so angry at this point .
neutral	not much of a complaint really , but no unpacking service is offered , so we had no choice but to struggle .
positive	definitely worth 0_stars .
neutral	i suspect the original booking had not been placed on the system so the £_00 was unreasonable
neutral	seems to be a good value -- tell you better after i have completed the aids / lifecycle -- a 000 mile bicycle ride from sf to la to raise money to fight aids !
positive	although the carriers were good and i ordered on friday and got it monday a m .
negative	what a complete_waste of time , i wish i had read the reviews about the company first of all and would never have went near them .
neutral	my friends are staggered that i pay over_£_00_pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn_'_t all that either ( which i '_m stuck with for 00 mths !
negative	big_mistake - avoid in future .
positive	the items i got were as_described , i '_d definitely recommend
neutral	not the best service !
positive	very quick delivery and good value
neutral	i selected a thursday for delivery which was several days in_advance .
neutral	shop around , you may find cheaper rates on the same travel dates , at approximately 00 weeks ahead .
positive	good service , quick delivery , genuine product at reasonable prices .
negative	i saw rajapack advertisment through ebay , i thought the prices were resonable so i went_ahead and ordered 000 dvd mailers .
neutral	they were made of very soft steel , and didn_'_t fit the blind properly .
positive	every other aspect about the order was first_class . cannot_fault it at all .
positive	i ordered , they delivered .
positive	received very quickly this was well_packaged and great quality .
neutral	i chose this bunch as it was full of purple flowers ( my mum '_s favourite colour ) and contained freesia ( my mum '_s favourite_flower ).
neutral	they have gone in a charity box .
negative	eventually got through on the 0pence per_minute line and told to re - place order and that would be acknowledged .
neutral	the software was far too slow for inner city travel .
positive	i was looking for a union flag waistcoat for my husband for a ball we were attending .
negative	no apologies or alternatives given - complete incompetence with a take it or leave it attitude .
neutral	looked into returning the item , only to find that i hadn_'_t been quick enough ( a very short 0 day returns window ) though there was no mention of this on the despatch_note .
positive	i ordered a superman costume for my husband , like you do . amazing delivery service and awesome costume .
positive	first_class service , would definitely recommend and will be using again 😃😃
positive	from placing the order to delivery was 00_hours .
positive	it was the cheapest on the internet by far and arrived very quickly , i wouldn_'_t hesitate to buy from these_guys again .
negative	these also broke within a week due to the same shoddy , cheap chinese manufacturing .
negative	easytobook . com just sent us from one non_existent booking to another .
negative	still no contact from viagogo .
neutral	item was packaged well in bubble_wrap , with a speedy delivery .
positive	i purchased jcb batteries which had an excellent offer on them which was good value for money .
neutral	company who sold table very helpful , advised on type of table we had chosen made some suggestions that we may be purchasing the wrong type of table for purpose , had no_problems with service at all , until delivery , delivered by 0 lazy oafs who refused to move the table into the school left it propped against a fence on full_view of public and unsecured , shook his head that we actually wanted him to carry the table into the school , they were useless and unfortunately let this company down , i dont_know how much you pay for delivery but i would consider_changing as they let your excellent service completely down , as i will not consider your company again untli you change the delivery drivers .
negative	holiday - flawless
neutral	the vehicle was in fact located at the preston dealership with the price displayed in the windscreen .

neutral	great delivery service .
positive	powerbar gels came exactly as_described atr great price .
negative	i booked a car in cancun airport with sixt and nobody showed up to pick me up , they have no office in the actual airport .
negative	so be warned if you complain you will get bumped around from pillart to post !
positive	could ask for more really .
neutral	i received an e_mail on the day it was due to be delivered to say the courier couldn_'_t deliver and it would come the following_day , as it was heavy and they needed a different vehicle .
neutral	any other company i have used in the past have sent the missing items straight_away , after all , it is their mistake .
negative	firstly , my original delivery was scheduled for an afternoon slot , and when i asked if there was any chance it could be changed to a morning slot , customer_services said no .
negative	when you ask for a quote you '_ll get offers by text and what looks_like a mobile number to ring .
positive	i uploaded the order on tuesday_morning and the picture arrived via the standard " free " service before 00am on thursday .
neutral	i will try the same company again , but will check that the prescription has arrived
negative	this time , they call on the morning of the delivery and say that the item ( s ) are still unavailable , and that it is a short_notice cancellation because it only just showed up on the systems .
neutral	the organisation at harwich was very poor with lack of information and delay .
positive	convenient way of buying over bulb replacement
neutral	it '_s ok but everyday the offers come through and the offers are very poor
negative	i know it '_s cattle class & i should be grateful i don_'_t have to pedal the crappy old planes they fly but i will actually go across the country to another airport to avoid them .
negative	at 00 . 00pm i received an_email from xdp saying ' it wont_be out today , i have not received any freight for delivery today .

positive	best online shopping_experience i '_ve had , one part was faulty but they bent_over_backwards to rush a replacement to me .
neutral	i just hope i can resolve this dispute .
negative	i shall now add this further info to my trustpilot review as my time has_been wasted even further what a joke !
neutral	we have found our orders can easily be forgotten and collection and delivery is an additional 0 days due to an outside contractor collecting the order .
neutral	a quote from stoneacre online site :
neutral	( hence three stars not two .)
negative	i had an_email letting_me know and asking me what i wanted to do which was great but then no one replied to my email and the number they provide to call for assistance didn_'_t work .
positive	i was expecting a basic level of service which would promote our property on the main portals such as rightmove etc .
positive	and it has to be sent to switzerland , so i would definitely recommend pharmacy0u to everyone !
negative	our kitchen_fitters , who were brilliant as we had our own and not wrens , were very patient the whole time but not surprised at the hassle we were having as they had encountered it before .
neutral	following_day an_email informed delivery would be on 0 . 0 . 00 .
negative	order the correct code but key doesn_'_t work
positive	from ordering to delivery purchasing from beanbagbazaar has_been a very good experience .
positive	well_packaged .
neutral	i thought about sending it back for a refund but i was curious to hear what it sounded_like so i decided to put another plug on it .
positive	i know where i will go first when i change this one !
neutral	if you choose the tracking_number option , you will need to request in_advance or right after you receive the shipping confirmation , unfortunately it can '_t be sent automatically .
neutral	we had a problem with the brakes the first time we drove the car which was very quickly rectified by returning the car to the office and another was supplied .
negative	i booked a vehicle on line from economy_car_rentals in march_0000 for a week in august that they described on their website as ‘ intermediate , ford_focus or similar ’ and the capacity of the boot was described as ‘ 0 large suitcases 000_litres and 0 small suitcases 00 litres ’.
neutral	* in big orange letters then small letters for when you order online at : bla_bla_bla this dose not exactly jump out in your face .
positive	i ordered and paid for fast delivery , and that was excellent and all tracked .
positive	after being given " my order " from the better half , and not being_able to find it on the high_street , i decided to try the drink store .
neutral	i rang on sat as i could not purchase the furniture , only to find out the purchasing dept and online purchasing does not work weekends !
neutral	i learned that the label with the bouquet gave only my christian_name as the sender .
positive	fino vare til god_pris med hurtig ekspedition
positive	why don_'_t you do " vouchers "?
neutral	our sofa was damaged on delivery we called dfs and had to wait two_weeks for repair parts were missing and as we spent 0 grand i expected a lot better
neutral	i arranged for it to be collected and a refund to be made .
negative	be warned .
positive	i have and will recommend them to others .
positive	i '_m now compiling my fifth annual photo_album .
neutral	other_sites , such as red spotted handkerchief seem to be different , offer different prices , and are sometimes available before either thetrainline , or the other similar_sites .
negative	they have a facebook_page that they are updating all the time yet they are too_busy to issue refund '_s .
negative	" you should have checked the tickets " was their excuse .
positive	also , i live in north_east scotland , so i had no expectations of a quick delivery .
positive	overall a good experience .
negative	!
positive	order placed at 0pm and item was delivered at 0pm next_day . fastest service ive_ever had . good quality and price too
negative	an executable file that cannot be removed = virus .
neutral	i only ordered a small bulb for the interior light for my fridge , although the bulb is fine and worked i think £ 0 . 00 is a bit_steep fo the delivery .
neutral	sadly , one of those items was the lipstick i had been searching for .
negative	at the end of the day if your business sells this kind of quality and finds it acceptable , then it would appear that you are not considering the happiness of your customer and if this is the kind of product that you are prepared to endorse and stock then this will create the image and integrety that your business will portray publicly .
neutral	i am seriously_considering referring this matter to the relevant trade body or trading_standards .
neutral	the delivery driver got through a padlocked gate and risked attack from our dog .
negative	he gave_me a diary to complete should it fail again with questions to answer to give a better idea as what was wrong .
negative	and yes , they do have a daily mail and parcel service there !
neutral	our point of contact then went on annual_leave , that '_s where the stress started .
negative	he replied " fair_enough "
positive	thank_you for all your help and patience .

positive	mazuma informed me of receipt of delivery the next_day .
neutral	drove home a bit happier :-)
positive	i ordered it , it arrived very promptly , and it fitted_perfectly , so no need for a refund .

positive	unrivalled service , many_thanks .
positive	phill hobson
neutral	as it is i gave had to buy some more from another_supplier which i didn_'_t want to do .
neutral	i have had numerous orders from diet_chef to this address so to claim they could not find the house is not true . they also had a mobile number & a house number .
positive	goods arrived on time .
positive	thanks
negative	took longer_than said to come and awful quality costume for what i paid
positive	the item was exactly as_described and is very high_quality , i was kept up to date with the progress of my order and the delivery men were very helpful .
neutral	the closeup chair photos on the back in action website do show these holes and it isn_'_t obvious that they aren_'_t required to fit the new babyset , however seeing that the babyset had changed i should have double_checked .
negative	i used to be a great fan of ri , but this company is turned into one of my most hated and i refuse to give them any more of my money !!
positive	i was notified when my phone had been received and the money was released the same day .
negative	cards not being left , the online tracker not really baring any relation to where the parcel is , actually being home when they noted they " attempted to deliver ", having to drive halfway across the country and that '_s not to mention the time it takes to get through to their call_centre when there is an issue ( which there most_likely will be !)
negative	after 0_weeks , we are still_waiting for one part of bed to arrive ( unusable without it ).
positive	you can '_t go_wrong , take my advise shop there with confidence
neutral	have bought much_cheaper covers before that have been far_superior .
positive	will definitely be purchasing again !
neutral	i notified woolovers after 0_days ( surely it would have arrived by then ?)
neutral	i wonder_how many people just go sod it and except the £_000 re quote !

positive	i stumbled upn festive_lights and found that the site was easy to navigate and each page contained good information on what you require and if you needed a power pack they told you which one was required .
neutral	thanks laura .
neutral	it would be easier to ask for the make and model straight_away .
neutral	i consider myself fortunate to have met malcolm and i would not_hesitate to recommend him to anyone who has to look at this subject in detail and in depth .
neutral	fast service , shame about the delivery carrier , my package was late despite paying extra for guaranteed delivery .
neutral	this is not important to me and does not affect my decision to reorder .
neutral	i telephoned customer service straightaway and spoke to a guy_who didn_'_t really seem overly bothered .
neutral	other than that it looked great .
negative	i have been in touch with customer service tonight , so have yet to sort this out .
positive	after buying made to measure_blinds from another company i decided to give blinds 0 go a try and am very pleased with the service , quality and fit for the price .
negative	i pointed_out how foolish it would be to cut it so fine given that things obviously had already gone_wrong once .
positive	i was amazed at the response time from placing the order to receiving the product .
negative	i have never had the worst dealings with a company in my entire life !
negative	!
neutral	playa_blanca very nice , good restaurants and service but no local guidance sheet in the villa information guide - odd and no help on this front !
negative	i have 0 contracts with 0 and certainly will not be renewing .
neutral	however was slightly_disappointed with my product .
positive	all i all i recommend sds heartily .
positive	just an extremely satisified customer .
neutral	cdw is only covered with worldwide plus , so i ' d have had to pay extra for this .
neutral	the card looked great but the layout of what i wanted written inside was very poor which was a let_down .
neutral	instead , i had to go to the self - service restaurant , where the stuff on offer was really just pub food , and not very appetizing at that .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i can justify £_000 for another 00 week set of meals .
positive	great prices and products , i couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	i used hostelbookers last_year when i was on a 0month uk and europe trip . with no_hassles at all .
negative	customers vote with their feet & will shop elsewhere .
positive	courteous and helpful .
positive	fantastic service .
positive	i have recommended quidco to everyone i know .
positive	recieved a brillant packed parcel containing delious chocolate , i am going to use some of it making cake pops never made before , but i think my granson will be licking the spoons .
positive	faultless service from end , would change couriers from fed_ex to royal_mail as it has more depots to pick_up from if delivery not made due to not being home .
negative	this is the worst estate_agents on the planet .
negative	as they take the money the moment you make the order , i think they make their profit on the interest rather_than selling garden_buildings .
positive	think it must be the magnesium and iron .
positive	arrived on time as promised .
neutral	no contact by them after 0nd delay .
neutral	arrival was ok but we should be told to go into the short_stay car_park as it was confusing as to where to wait for the driver .
negative	i contacted the help_desk and they were very helpful and apologetic and promised to send the missing items out asap - a delivery duly_arrived on the tuesday however the frame part was not on the delivery , the wrong amount of springs had been sent and they were a different size from the ones which came with the original delivery !!
positive	the website is excellent , and this is how i discovered fish_oil .
negative	the other is a set of bunk_beds for her two children , who have to remain sleeping on the floor until argos decide that they can finally fulfil their end of the deal .
neutral	after_speaking to customer service i had to send the empty box back and order a replacement .
neutral	i have been a customer for long .
neutral	i '_m still trying to find the system event viewer to find out why the pc crashed .
positive	do you know about ao . com now they are great for any appliance you require for the house , prices won_'_t be_beaten .
positive	very good soon has i ordered they called me to double_check thing were right .
positive	:)
positive	never used before but will be using again as super delivery and service .
negative	the p_&_p was £ 0 . 00 , which i had not spotted at the point of order .
neutral	he abruptly stated :” i ’ ve had enough of you today , you can deal with the office ”.
negative	still_waiting back to here from serenata_flowers .
neutral	it did get very sore after about 00_mins but a friend had advised me to go to sleep for a few hours and when i woke_up i could see almost perfectly .
neutral	personally i think all deliveries should be first_class and it always irritates me that i '_m supposedly getting free delivery because i '_m spending more than £_00 only to be hit by , what is in effect , a delivery charge .
positive	very quick delivery .
neutral	the new ones looked good so were fairly happy in the end .
positive	product came very quickly
negative	and taking up to two_weeks ( or more ) to provide a refund for something you never received in the first place tells you everything you need to know about this outfit .
positive	excellent goods , just as_described and all_round excellent service
neutral	the car infact took 0_weeks to just reach the supplier , i then had to wait 00 working_days for a cooling_off period before the car could be delivered to me .
negative	several days of parcel0go telling_me that " myhermes would not respond within 00_hours " ensued .
positive	ordered in the morning and goods were delivered , well_packaged , the next_day .
negative	!
negative	i mean they do take out a new contract with o0 don_'_t they deserve some discount as against to those who just walked in from nowhere with no history with o0 at all ?
neutral	the villas are advertised as well stocked with cooking_utensils etc . however on the first morning whilst preparing breakfast discovered this was not so , spied a small notice on the kitchen wall to say kitchen articles may be found in the other villas , surely the cleaners should ensure articles are returned so new occupants do not have to go searching out utensils !
positive	i have used viovet a number of occassions now and found them to be absolutely_brilliant , they are very fast dealing_with orders , i have actually received my orders within 0 - 0_days of ordering .
negative	your offer of providing train_tickets is ridiculous .
negative	the customer service lady was quite good but no - one else has_been in touch and i have been told policy is policy .
positive	the only_thing that i would mention is that , although this is a ' whole juicer '', you can '_t actually put large fruit or veg in whole , as there is a bit that they call the ' tongue ' that sticks out inside the main feeder tube , so you do have to cut the fruit and veg down a little , which was a little_disappointing .
positive	they regualrly send e_mails to tell you of offers of flights and hilidays .
positive	these were delivered next_day .
negative	they offered to refund the difference and that was all .
negative	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
negative	so i have not only been basically sent the wrong item , it has failed on me within 0 or 0_weeks of barely any use .
negative	then my goods were shown as dispatched but the parcel_force tracking_number was never recognised on parcel_force website - what a joke !!
negative	i think the office of the information commissioner is going to get a letter soon , off - com as well and lastly a court claim .
negative	they are still ***** operating ??!
positive	the pack was received quickly and the money transferred to my account promptly .
neutral	00_minutes .
positive	good quality organic seeds with a long sell - by date at a fair price .
negative	these numbers are not shown on their website but do work and connect to 000blinds .
neutral	the problem i had was not being_able to order a swatch for the rug i wanted to buy which_meant i just had to take a risk .
negative	all went well and the parcel was picked_up in the uk on the 0th_december .
negative	i will not be using etyres again and i would not recommend them based on this poor experience .
neutral	no problem with argus_car_hire but fire fly car_hire in malaga we ' re not very good .
neutral	i had bought a bunch of flowers the day before from waitrose and they cost me £ 0 , they were really lovely .
positive	fantastic service !
negative	all in all the quality was terrible .
neutral	!
neutral	the instructions said to press the call button and speak to an expert operator in case of difficulty - which was fine_except there was no button marked for assistance .
positive	tyreshopper is my first_port of call for tyres .
positive	brilliant
negative	for an order of nearly_£_000 you would think they '_d make an effort .
negative	have been waiting for an important delivery from dpd and would like to share my experience .
negative	i can always_rely_on serenata for the wow_factor .
negative	i can put money on it that it was in fact his first_attempt !
neutral	good quality book and print , software is capable but has a steep_learning_curve especially for the less computer_literate .
negative	i am extremely annoyed about the way tesco has let us down .
positive	this is the only online comapny i deal with now !
negative	i will use them in future .
positive	watch arrived exactly as advertised , couldn_'_t be_happier and will certainly be using this company again .
negative	i listened and said that i was interested in a deal .
negative	i need to be compensated for wastage of my time and money over making these unnecessary enquiries .
negative	then a few_months later i broke one of the lenses .
neutral	however , when i arrived at avis they insisted i pay a £ 0000 deposit because i didn_'_t use their cover .
neutral	not good guys
neutral	this is the second seal i '_ve purchased .
neutral	should have saved_myself the postage and gone there instead
neutral	when i arrived to have them fitted they found out that they were of 0 different_sizes .
positive	i want my guests to think i '_ve made the effort , and the invitations certainly set the standard for me .
positive	quick and easy
negative	i ordered some flowers for my sick_friend from this company .
positive	i have given iflorist 0_stars because although i never get to see the flowers / gifts that they have delivered on my behalf , i have received telephone_calls from very excited and grateful relatives and friends .
negative	the one o ring missing was the one needed by the plumber which seals off the flow of the water when turning the shower off .
positive	this is my 0rd maclaren xlr !
neutral	i must put my complaint in writing .
positive	packaged well and exactly_what i had expected .
positive	very fast delivery .
positive	listen to this !
neutral	but when i contacted serenata_flowers to ask if a note could be put on the order to say that my friend would definitely be in after 0pm , they were quite offhand with the reply and refused to help .
positive	have dealt_with them before and when i asked for a refund it came promptly .
positive	over the years strings_direct have increased the overall product range into more makes of guitars and amplifiers and still manage to keep the prices competitive throughout the range .
neutral	they had been accidentally left in the printer to long however , and the picture was on both_sides .
negative	i ordered 0 items on 0th_september ; the website advised there was a 0 week wait for 0 of the items and the whole delivery would be sent at the same time .
positive	the clocks are excellent quality - better_than i imagined .
neutral	having said that my order is supposed to arrive on tuesday 00th_may ( placed on 00th_april ) bank_holiday '_s and stock etc .
positive	after ordering the car with them it arrived 0_weeks_later and i am over the moon with it .
positive	recipient delighted with them .
positive	i didn_'_t expect the roller_blind to look so good , but they do , we are going order more for other windows in our home .
negative	they believe they ' re big enough to ride the storms .
neutral	i purchased the plum pixie fairy costume which was unfortunately not as pictured .
negative	literally the worst customer_care skills in the history of the world .
negative	heartbroken boy on christmas day !
negative	after_contacting customer service on a couple of occasions and when they could still not say when the item would be delivered i told them to cancel order and refund my money which eventually they did .
positive	will use again !
positive	ordered 0 games .
neutral	having said this i have used your service for a few_years and have always been pleased with my final cards .
positive	very pleased with the service - couldn_'_t fault it .
neutral	so for now they will do the job .
negative	when i phoned to query it , was told it had been cancelled because my payment had not gone_through .
negative	i hasten to add no cards or anything left either .
negative	i asked them to return the item .
positive	compared the prices online and found them to be the cheapest , booked slot in for two_days_later .
negative	i gave up with sports leisure and contacted the local delivering depot directly and because i am an executive in a parcel carrier company i know the local companies and explained the situation to them and they kindly delivered the goods that afternoon .
positive	the online images were very accurate .
negative	i ordered self_assembly guest beds .
neutral	all on the title .
negative	absolutely rubbish they put down they couldnt deliver to me today as they couldnt get access to my property i live in a bloody close they are just lazy and dont evan come into our village half the time they just send it back to sender ive been ordering xmas_presents i proberly wont get all my catologues use yodel if they want to keep customers they should get_rid
positive	site is a dream and all done in a few mins too !
negative	that is a lot of money to a 00 year_old .
negative	they then lost my parcel but refused to pay compensation .
negative	i never received my item , my money was taken and i never received what i paid for .
positive	found a phone .
positive	the flies are now all dead and i will re - order when they return next year !
positive	made everything so easy no problem at all
neutral	my advice - help the drivers apply some common_sense and ask for parcels to be left with a neighbour .
negative	i did manage to speak to this keith guy a few_times , who would always assure me that he would get my order out the following_day , citing staff illness as the cause of the delay .
negative	the courier had already arrived by this time , coming one day late , luckily he came during the one hour that day which i was at home , so i was able to give him my item .
neutral	they said they would call the courier service and change the address with them .
neutral	0_days passed and my package had not been delivered .
neutral	many comments i have read have made me worry because many cases faced with misspelling in their names and the flight was re - scheduled and the company didn_'_t inform the customers and re - issue a new e_- ticket for them which made customers faced with no - choice situation at the airport on the flying date and time when the desk cannot check - in and verify / print them the tickets resulted_in missing the flight and had to buy new flight which caused more money .
negative	0 hours_later they replied asking me what pair of glasses i wanted ( despite having 0 links to them ) and i responded straight_away .
negative	i rang up to dispute this and they said they had made a mistake and they would wipe the debt , however they could only wipe £_000 . 00 of it because £_000 . 00 of it was for the cost of the talktalk box although i still hadn_'_t received the bag to send the box back in the post .
positive	within 0_days of stopping the diet the rash has_gone and i don_'_t itch anymore .
negative	i emailed customer service to outline my issue .
negative	we have complained in writing and in person to stoneacre hull who so far have told us that we can not get out of the agreement .
negative	truly_terrible service , and i will be contacting their head_office and making a formal_complaint about their service , their company and their staff as a whole .
negative	the " expert " roy had written to me telling_me how to set_up the thermostat which i duly did and it still didn_'_t work .
neutral	it '_s just that they were not as in the picture .
negative	just googling the top line of my email got me loads of people with the same problem , site seems happy enough to take your money but they don_'_t have any of the items instock despite saying so !
negative	i placed my first order with beautybay and was really impressed with the price and speedy delivery .
negative	total_waste of time .
negative	will never use again .
positive	craig mathieson
neutral	i received all of the goods i ordered very quickly given that they were shipped to ireland .
positive	got exactly_what it said in the ad , and quickly , if you think what it costs to drive to town / get a bus / car parking charges why not shop online , and these_guys send it quick so its not much different from going shopping anyway .
positive	great price and very good service .
neutral	products were excellent and looked great on the table .
negative	now wont refund the postage cost despite me telling them to cancel the order when they werent delivered .
negative	i placed two orders on the 00th of june with ccl .
neutral	update
negative	the flowers arrived a day late , and i received no email update as stated in the terms and conditions .
positive	phoned on our way to the airport and they were there when we arrived and our car was brought back promptly on our return .
negative	waited for weeks to get my order , then got the wrong order and now i '_ve got to prove they have sent me the wrong glasses before i get the pair i '_ve paid for months_ago !
positive	the team are also very active on facebook and i mentioned some time ago that i would love to see them stock some of the lovepedal range , especially the kalamazoo overdrive pedal .
neutral	and then my bank thought the transaction was fraudulent .
negative	i had to default on the loan and pay fees so the corrupt company makes more from my poverty .
negative	but that '_s just my opinion so consider the following scenario :
neutral	after 0 days of nothing turning_up i called hq , to find they knew nothing about it , but then said wait a couple of days .
neutral	good selection of holidays .
neutral	i understand mothers_day is a busy day for deliveries , and my mum is very slow , but surely that '_s to be expected on mothers_day for quite a few recipients !?
positive	the flowers were beautiful and the service was second to none . i would definitely recommend this company .
neutral	service was good in that the flowers were delivered on time but they looked quite wilted when they were displayed at the funeral
positive	needed photo_book to celebrate son '_s 00st .
neutral	well it turns_out the deal was by a rip - off company who sells at stupid prices .

positive	they ' re awesome .
negative	since they became pcworld / currys they have got worse and worse it seems to me .
negative	i was told it was booked but then they let_me down on the night .
positive	easy to order came with in days very good service and solar_lights very good
negative	great example of a large company who are focussed totally on cost at the expense of working with customers when issues_arise ( as they do with even the best of businesses ).
negative	then they closed the dispute and stopped_talking .
positive	i have been using the bead_shop for a number of years and have always received good communications and never been disappointed with the goods or service .
neutral	from my experiences in other company i have money back for those item and they charge me when item was in stock again .
negative	had the problem getting my money from the deal then get told theres a £ 0 fee thats just not right
negative	i emailed them straight back and never_heard from them again .
neutral	i use shopto a lot primarily_because the next_day delivery is so reliable no matter what time i shop .
neutral	the cardboard was thinner , and some of them had to be forced open where the glue had caught .
negative	evidence collated after_contacting the complainants on other review forum suggests that majority as high as 00_% of the complainants had a minority ethnicity background .
neutral	so i rang up and spoke to a very helpful man called dave .
neutral	the calendar also started from october and i had expected it to be from january but i may have missed the description .
negative	the card was miswritten - all the romance was lost when " to my lobster " ( friends series 0 , episode 00 ) was written as " to my brother "!
positive	also i '_m quite_tall so often have trouble with sizes at fancy_dress shops but this fitted_perfectly and looked great !
neutral	ok service online ( just ), but charged_£ 0 . 00 to deliver some gift_vouchers to my friend for her_birthday who_lives just up the road from longacres , and i thought the royal_mail was getting expensive !!!!
positive	very helpful staff when we needed an extra ticket !
positive	they are doing well in uk sunlight !
neutral	i give it 0_stars as - 0 for instructions & - 0 for quality of materials .
positive	my opinion above_says it all
negative	there '_s a problem with my order most time '_s i use this service .

negative	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of shoes , order accepted , confirmation emailed , but then the following_day i received and email to say 0 pair were not of good quality , so the entire order was cancelled !!

negative	i '_m honestly at my wits_end with this company .
negative	yeah there was a problem alright . now i have to go to a local hotel on the day of the event to collect tickets !!!!!
positive	after 0 attempts i gave up and used this site instead .
neutral	it isnt made clear that the flowers would be so small .
negative	i returned one unworn , still with tags within 00_hours . to be told by them it was marked and i couldn_'_t have a refund . what the heck there was no mark it was brand_new . awful company refusing to honour their terms and conditions . i will never buy from them again and wished i '_d checked other review sites before buying a lot of people are having problems with figleaves . don_'_t buy from them terrible customer service !
negative	not sure_whether they sell second - hand good as ' new ', but i ordered a phone and it came with just the phone and charger in a box - no instruction_manual or anything .
negative	the annoying_thing is that i ordered more stuff from them straight after before this became an issue and gave them more business which i wish i hadn_'_t .
negative	this service is appalling and will cause you inconvenience , take up your time , and , depending_on the particular situation , might actually cost you financially .
neutral	i paid extra for the extra think lenses and when they arrived , they were identical to the standard lenses i had in both my other pairs of glasses .
neutral	as previously mentioned , my husband lost a day ’_s holiday from work which i understand you usually compensate with £_00 , i had to take an additional day ’_s leave so what do we get for the downright rudeness of your employee wally and the incompetence of your surveyor ?
positive	thank_you .
neutral	even allowing for the xmas holidays - this would appear to have taken much longet to deliver than we would jave expected .
negative	disappointed .

positive	all good and no_probs
negative	i have been in touch with mighty_deals over the last month ( since 00th_march ) but so far although they have promised to send me a remote_control nothing has arrived and as far as the 00 piece cutlery_set goes i have heard absolutely nothing .
neutral	i do not know if national fitted the tyres sent to them or used some old tyres from their stock .
negative	will never use this site again !
negative	no phone_call in 00 days to say this .
negative	i responded to advise that as the birthday had passed their seemed little point in resending the flowers and enquired as to the value of the refund .
positive	i was a bit_cautious to buy this product as it '_s designed for the american_market , made in korea and it doesn_'_t seem to be possible to purchase from an ordinary retailer here .
neutral	if talk - talk brought their customer_services back to the uk - i would consider switching my home broadband .
neutral	and secondly your ' live_chat ' does not work !
positive	excellent service , super_fast , well informed_throughout , would definitely use again .
positive	a fast & efficient service .
neutral	it turns_out the courier was going to the flat downstairs contrary to my 0st floor_flat instructions .

positive	hassle_free .
negative	you have been warned !
positive	all good .
neutral	i probably_wouldn_'_t recommend this company unless they change delivery method .
negative	i got an_email on nov 0th to say the order had been dispatched .
positive	thank_you !
positive	byley
neutral	the books need to be specifically marked ex library and books marked very good have frequently been of inferior quality , but that is my personal experience , otherwise when they are operating normally they are a good service . postage is cool and delivery sometimes needs to be faster .
negative	never received my order , when they kept emailing me , i gave them an order for my dog flea_treatment , was told next_day it would arrive , and 0_days_later nothing , it took them all afternoon to email back , i wont use them again , but the emails were polite .
neutral	i had been warned that changes could be very expensive with the type of ticket so that was no big surprise .
negative	when my change of details quotation was received i sent an_email to their customer_services and was directed to their website , no help what so ever as it would have required someone to talk to me and go through the file to resolve the issue !
positive	extra memory ordered for my acer_netbook on monday - delivered and fitted by tuesday_lunchtime .
negative	two_days_later i telephoned and was promised the order would be fulfilled in a few_days .

negative	i called and they said they dont price match amazon even_though its them selling it !
negative	not happy .
neutral	just cos you like to share everything doesnt mean that we do .
positive	great software to design book .
positive	excellent service
neutral	the sale process was just awful - the salesman kept making mistakes , overcharging me , then not really understanding the credit terms and conditions of the sale which_meant he got one wrong , and made false allegations that it was free credit when actually it is not , as there is a charge of £_00 or so on repayment .
positive	!
positive	good value & service
positive	product description was accurate , including measurements .
negative	placed order reference wa000000 on 00th_august_0000 for delivery on 00th_august_0000 .
neutral	notenotenote ;
neutral	but with craddocks they tell you if they are .

neutral	easy enough .
negative	would they ?
positive	great service , time after time .
neutral	more information would have been useful .
positive	i found greenman_bushcraft after_googling .
neutral	if so , that would be fair_enough , were that well explained , but i didn_'_t see anything to that effect .
positive	as a woman of a certain_age who has spent 00 years being hot every night i am looking_forward to better sleep .
negative	here we go with numerous_emails again !
negative	it hardly works at all on normal paper but on glossy photo_paper the top half works but loses all the warm colours as it goes towards the lower part of the page
negative	they say they '_ve been when they havn '_t
positive	this really made my 0 day break to istanbul a total hit .
negative	amazon issues a refund then emails you to say if you still want the item then you have to re - order it . hello muppets >>>> thats_why i ordered it in the first place . wont order from amazon again as if i order on line i expect it to be delivered
negative	- i missed a dinner with my girlfriend '_s family
positive	very simple to order and delivered exactly as stated .
neutral	service was excellent and delivery was very quick .

neutral	so a big saving right ?
positive	never fixed a shower in my life .
neutral	the initial car was described as clean when in fact it had very bad scratching to each front corner and the left rear , was covered in dirt and much more seriously , a large crack in the windscreen .
positive	cheque arrived almost_immediately for £_00 .
negative	avoid this website .
negative	don_'_t expect any pleasantries from the branch i had visited , the staff carefully_selected to have no personality or friendly outlook , and yet have been specially trained in rubbing their hands in a miserly manner and grinning eagerly at the till whilst exchanging some unwelcome cheek .
neutral	my vets charge me £_000 a month compared to animed charging £_000 so massive_savings . apart_from the lack of communication initially the experience was good .
negative	i was not pleased by the customer service lady she rang parcel_force she apologised but no compensation or in anyway was i told on how to air my concerns .
neutral	i had a card last_year when parking at birmingham to say i was due 00_%_off
positive	i was pleased with the pair of tyres i bought from tyreleader .
positive	all this is down to chemist_direct selling products at a reasonable_price .
negative	not mentioning the very bad coverage
negative	i was told it would be delivered christmas_eve , again nothing .
neutral	the poor delivery man who brought the second iron had never been on the route before , had been given no map , not been allowed to pack his van himself so didn_'_t know where anything was and , at the time he got to me , had had to miss out 00 people as he had not been allowed enough time to sort himself out .
negative	why would i want one of those .
positive	excellent service .
negative	order roses for my girlfriend for our 0year and 0months while on tour when they got to her they were dieing
negative	avoid .
negative	will never order from this site again .
negative	i called them back to be told the next delivery day was over a month after my original order date , like it or lump it , and on a day when i couldn_'_t be in anyway .
positive	the ink was also good quality and really affordable compared to store prices .
negative	they have got to be one of the worst companies to deal with when it comes to changing or ending a contract , even after 0 hours of trying to get them to cancel my contract and being told that i was making " the wrong decision " by leaving them and that leaving them for a rival carrier was " stupid ", they still didn_'_t even do what i asked them to do in the first place which was end my rolling_contract , which resulted_in me having to phone them again , and of course going through the exact_same stuff and tripe that their staff have to come out with .
neutral	however , my brother was very pleased with the orchid he received so all in all quite a good service .
negative	after telephoning for transport to take them to the airport .
neutral	the 0 items in question are the st . george cross bow_tie (( btpnm00dp000r ) & the union_flag waistcoat ( wcofm00dp000r ).
neutral	i bought a tow_bar .
positive	always been very pleased with the service and will_continue to order from them as long as the quality of the perfumes remain the same .
negative	as it was under_£_00 the charge for delivery was £ 0 . 00 , which i felt was a bit_steep but as i needed the mattress asap , was willing to pay .
positive	happy to use again
negative	i also asked for someone to call me on tuesday ( after easter ) as i was very dissatisfied and was getting no where by ' tickets ' 00th_april_0000 ' ticket ' reply_saying how sorry they were and a call back had been arranged for tuesday 00nd_april_0000 .
positive	also the price , the price makes a diffence , not cheap but good value for money .
positive	after ordering an item , i had emails_keeping_me informed of the delivery .
positive	no_problems with delivery .
neutral	i used to order from svp on a weekly_basis , sometimes more , but in the past year their poor stock control , faulty item and appalling delivery has meant i have had to look_elsewhere .
negative	this kind of half baked offering and lack of communication is no different from cheap online stores - so you may as well save_yourself the money !
negative	there was a delay as the glasses as a 0st set of lenses had failed quality checks and we had to reorder another pair of the lenses .
neutral	this again took time , good thing i had left plenty of space between my arrival and the plane '_s departure .

negative	i emailed back the company at around 0 :_00pm to get some idea of what was happening and to get confirmation that there would definitely be a collection but this time didn_'_t receive any replies back at all .
positive	cheapsmells have some great prices on items that are much higher in price elsewhere .

neutral	i tried to obtain the norton_000 offer proffered by total_computing by e_- mail but nearly despaired after attempting payment on three occasions ( each successfully and positively verified by my bank ) but failing to be accepted by total .
neutral	according to parcelhero staff , fedex does not carry knives and my parcel could have been impounded in uk by the authorities .
negative	admin ?
negative	then payment sense is the one for you .
positive	cheaper_than national_tyres website , yet the same company !
positive	i had been let_down by another delivery company and placed an order with tooled_- up . com .
negative	da_jeg luftede denne utilfredsked , fik_jeg blot at vide , at de_havde et hold til at svare på klager på trustpilot og facebook .
positive	i returned it free with their label .
negative	i arranged a payment plan with one of their managers - also securing a discount of £_00 and a refund of £ 0 for them trying to take the full_amount on the 00th of november when the funds weren_'_t available and very surprising as they ' d insisted numerous_times that they could only take dds on the 00th of the month .
positive	very happy with the purchase .
neutral	also you can always tell a new record because they stick to the inner sleeve .
negative	do your research on the procedure itself and ask yourself the question are you willing to take the risks .
positive	i was kept_fully_informed at all times as to what was happening .
neutral	other than that it was very satisfactory .
negative	they goods are clearly_marked " 0 persons to carry " but this delivery service sent one man to drag it off the lorry , potentially damaging it .
neutral	they have sent me regular_emails to inform that they still have not dispatched my item .
positive	great choice of vitamins , super_fast delivery
negative	it '_s a sham that a company can just report the negative_reviews and have them taken off
positive	fast delivery great item
neutral	it works ok when you figure how to load it up .
neutral	both_times they were quick to offer solutions but not the experience that we had had with them before .
positive	personally i will be ordering from this website again it is a good reliable_source to buy from professionally set and hassle_free .
positive	very efficient .
negative	what great fun for them .
negative	this company is awful .
neutral	there are no specific instructions and i wonder_if there is an ulterior motive for this - to put you off claiming .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time , but before i even had time to say thank_you and check the product the delivery man was back in the van and off down the street .
neutral	which is ' nt what you would of expected !
neutral	there are a couple of points that were missing when i last ordered online which i found some what annoying .
positive	currently working on a new flyer project for precisionsupplies . co . uk and will most definitely be using flyerzone once again !
positive	having identified the ear_phones i wanted i compared various suppliers offers .
negative	i called into branch where i bought it to ( con ) front them ( worksop branch ).
negative	well it seems like a respectable company that has hit the big time has finally stopped being customer lead and the money machine firmly kicks in by not giving a damn about the customer .
negative	customer_services were prompt in a response after stating they had been reported to trading_standards for not making me aware at any point of the ordering_process i was purchasing outside the uk .
negative	i had a confirmation straight_away and an update saying awaiting fulfilment .
negative	i received the email and found the product to be very hard to use , it is extremely basic with minimal functionality , no stock control , no shopping_basket , just paypal buttons , so you ' re dependant on paypal .
negative	i ordered garden_furniture to the value of £_000 and when it arrived it was brown and not black as i ordered .
positive	i found the staff at ability_superstore very helpfull and very understanding
neutral	disappointed to find that the total_cost of the order is hidden until the last moment , feel_cheated the original flowers were £_00 . 00 + £ 0 . 00 postage = £_00 . 00
negative	i was told my flowers would be delivered between 0 - 0 at 0 : 00 they rang me saying they didn_'_t have my flowers and they had rang around a few shops and they didn_'_t have either so they would make me up a new bunch of flowers didn_'_t say what just a ' nice bunch ' and then they didn_'_t arrive until 0 & 0 / 0 hours_later . the next time didn_'_t get any phone_calls was waiting all day ordered thursday to come friday they didn_'_t come until the next_day at 00am i recomend if you want what u order and on time go elsewhere as theses are not a reliable company as this is the second time its happened to me now .
neutral	pruducts are great delivery is mainly through herms they make you wait all day dont turn_up and say they tride to deliver , ei lie ,,,, i find this very terable buisness ,, i have had many products from discount supliments ,,,, havnt ordered for somtime just becuase of the delivery company is terable ,,, wish they would just do it by po or a delivery company that well give a time ie am or pm and turns_up , hermes does not give a time and lies they have tride to deliver when they have not or just not turn_up at all ,,

positive	i bought the clarisonic - fab product .
positive	the watch i initially wanted was not available as it was a limited_edition from a previous year .
neutral	would use the service again , but probably only on a special_occasion where getting to a local_florist was a challenge .
negative	three hours and 0 calls later , all saying the same as above but varying wait times , i decided to email .
positive	i was particulary impressed with how thy kept me informed , by text and by email .
neutral	it was then agreed that the delivery address could be changed to my work place and it would arrive at my work on the thursday .
positive	characters are well balanced and catch the wind just right .
negative	very dissatisfied .
negative	it comes to something when the staff are actively canvassing the victims , erm " customers ", to complain as the company won_'_t listen to them .
neutral	when we challenged that ( the correct answer is : if you are between 00 and 00 years old , and all drivers have to have at_least 0 year of driving_licence ), he became rude and dismissing .
neutral	i purchased a wardrobe with a drawer beneath .
negative	very bad service and terrible flowers !

neutral	this went_smoothly .

negative	i thought we were bro '_s for life , then i ask one little favour and you drop me like we never meant nothin .

positive	they keep making all these changes but you get used to it .
negative	your prices are great but your system is flawed beyond function
neutral	the bouquets were delivered on time and were acceptable though not fantastic , but they were delivered in a water bag without water which_meant they were already drooping by the time they were presented !

negative	if an online grocery service can '_t provide basic items it must be considered useless !!
neutral	sure enough the costume arrived bright and early the next_morning - no_complaints there , although i do think £ 0 for delivery is a bit much !
negative	it has_been a huge hastle trying to sort this out ee are refusing to cancel the contract and say i need to go to cpw .
neutral	i would absolutely purchase again but clearer instructions or even diagrams as to how you can configure these would be good .
positive	highly_recommend .
neutral	the phone was worth £_000 , i got £_00 .
negative	i can_assure you that this is not usual practice for us and is purely due to a high_volume of emails and calls being received at present .
negative	they offered a measly_£ 0 refund on my delivery charge - the order totaled over_£_000 - for what was already a ridiculous wait and was now going to be even longer .
neutral	customer service has_been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn_'_t provided .

neutral	the pods do work in my machine but i generally have to put them through twice to get a good cup .
negative	the car_park was absolutely full with cars_parked at all angles and tightly_packed with no spaces at all .
neutral	the site is great and really good at getting the products out it time , but the hellboy costume was really poor quality the mask ripped straight up the back and was really thin .
negative	trying to get back the deposit has_been a nightmare .
positive	we got a good deal & i would definately recommed the shop to anyone looking to buy a wedding and / or engagement_ring .

positive	i ordered slate_tiles but when they arrived i didn_'_t have time to check them all , so when i did come round to doing so i realised that i had roughly 0 boxes of broken tiles , and i must_say i was extremely impressed with the way they dealt_with the situation i would highly_recommend them to anyone thank_you again xxxx

neutral	i placed the free material over the side windows as it tells you to but after 0_weeks i removed the cover only to find the roof light had small swirl marks where it had moved around slightly .

neutral	it '_s a shame as i keep seeing links to gear on their site at very tempting prices .
neutral	we were emailed saying wowcher were under no obligation to offer a refund as 00 days had passed .
neutral	in this day and age everybody has a mobile and and it would be no problem to phone the receiver to inform of expected delivery time or indeed if he can '_t get there .
negative	been with the rac for over 0 years and not used them for a long time , used them twice overall .
negative	will have to swap suppliers some time soon as a priority !
negative	their only redeeming_feature is that they refunded me promptly .
neutral	000000000 ) so 0_weeks after i placed my order they told me i could not get what i wanted !
positive	i was very pleased with the extras ( freebies ) that were thrown in for free .
negative	this has_been a truly miserable and unsatisfying experience .
neutral	it has taken me 0 / 0 a day to try and sort it out .
neutral	tesco has_gone down in my opinion .
negative	they have said they tried to deliver today and left a card when my partner was there all day and at the time they say they did this currys were actually delivering a freezer so clearly lying .
negative	however , try and log in while your bets are open and in play and its another story .
neutral	what could i do ?

positive	i found the ordering on line easy to use .
neutral	i was waiting at my departure airport when i received an email to say that my car_hire reservation at my destination airport had been cancelled .
neutral	i wouldnt be so quick to blame the courier , mp are marking items as dispatched without actually dispatching them by the looks of things , please sort it out !
neutral	since then however i have received a lot of email from them , all basically asking me to tell them how good they are .
negative	the tickets i got were for the nottingham arena show on 0st april_0000 .
neutral	as i have had to retire on ill_health 0 years_ago i find that the payment every 0_months is becoming harder to find .
positive	and a second_hand guitar at a fantastic price .
neutral	price isnt everything !
neutral	they often have very useful products which mostly " do what they say on the tin " but don_'_t be_fooled with all the " free offers "!
neutral	not fittede it yet but it looks good quality .
neutral	ordered on thursday with a confirmed delivery for friday , got to about 0pm on friday and no sign so called them , very helpful lady answered the phone but all she could tell me was that there was no scheduled delivery for me today , said it would probably be delivered tomorrow , what saturday !
negative	awaiting a very expensive tv_stand and paid for saturday delivery , item said out for delivery . because i work monday to friday i can '_t be in for any deliveries . checked again at 0 . 00 pm ( unable to gain timely access ) yet when you call the 0000 number it clearly_states we will deliver upto 0 . 00pm . funny_thing is i live less_than 0 mile_away from the depot . yodel you are a joke this isn_'_t the first time this has happened and i have also emailed the company were i purchased the item from telling them that i don_'_t want the parcel now . i can_honestly_say that before i order anything on line again if the carrier is yodel they can jog on . oh_yes before i forget yodel social_media team if your going to reply to this do me a favour and use your own words rather_than copying and pasting the same old stuff that you put on all the posts .
neutral	i was impressed with the rental cost and although i found it somewhat difficult to locate the office i was still happy .

negative	the ticket arrived via_email showing economy status . i phoned to tell them of their ' mistake ' and was informed that i had only booked an economy ticket .
neutral	dont ignore the ads , i missed out on a great broadband detail because i went to the standard page which did not have the deal on offer by their ad .
positive	i '_ve been using the bead_shop for years_now and i can_honestly_say that i '_ve never been disappointed .
negative	did not receive the mattress i ordered .
neutral	this was not the case , and so the website listing was inaccurate and not up to date .
positive	quickly updated as to the status the process was in and fast payment .
neutral	all was fine for 0 months when , all of a sudden , the right peddle became lose & fell_off .
positive	as far as issues with orders or products , this is where they shine .
neutral	since i was frustrated i sent a complaint to city_link ( via_e_- mail ) and i ’_m still_waiting for a response from them .
positive	why look_elsewhere .
neutral	the roses showed some deterioration , browning on petals .

positive	great quality products at very low_prices .
positive	would highly_recommend
neutral	seems like nike have become lazy , taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch .
neutral	this is poor customer service , and something that could easily be remedied .
positive	the product always_arrives as promised .
positive	i would recommend them .
negative	why am i always on the receiving end of their incompetent and lying drivers ?
neutral	return spoiled by driver when i got off at 0 instead of 0 ( it was a long day ) and driver said he " didn_'_t go to 0 pal " then watched him drive to 0 then 0 so we had long cold walk to our car .
negative	- flowers don_'_t look anything like what u see on the website , i mean totally different !
neutral	my cruise leaves on the 0th .
negative	so all in all , a complete waist of 00_quid :(
positive	i received emails_advising me of each_stage of the process and both were delivered very quickly .
negative	despite my communication requesting the change of an item to one in stock , nothing was sent .
positive	the price was excellent so we ordered the worktops we needed and they were delivered at our convience .
positive	put them on straight out of the packed and literally haven_'_t looked back since .
neutral	due to having small children i opted for the mobile service to replace my 0 worn tyres .
positive	i was looking for a bush craft knife on the web and i came_across uttings site by pure_chance , its easy to use , i ordered what i wanted , no_problems , fast delivery , what more could you ask for , brilliant .
negative	( unless you can : p ).

neutral	delivery service good but ordered magimix toaster which did not work on delivery - no power .
neutral	flowers was not as shown on internet when inquired why told due to price delivery not included in price but i paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery won_'_t use you again

positive	ordered a few things from cash_generators now and can '_t fault them , quick and speedy and perfect every time x
positive	the service was excellent from my first enquiry to the finished trophy delivered on the day that was promised .
neutral	tesco give us value for money as long as you are on the alert when shopping .
negative	the item is still advertised as in stock with 0 - 0 days delivery on web_site .
positive	nice prices .
negative	luckily they refunded the money but this is still absolutely poor .
positive	the goods have always arrived in mint_condition , and i have always had the full order .
neutral	the staff are very friendly & helpful .
neutral	i also placed another order for a different property and didn_'_t receive an_email invoice for them .
neutral	the postage charge for a replacement item was taken out of my bank_account before i had been notified the original returned goods had been received and the replacement item was on its way .
negative	this all adds to a horrible experience .
neutral	it would '_ve been nice to know that it would be late .
neutral	eg .
positive	very impressed .
positive	got a whole new set of solid wooden bedroom_furniture .
positive	battery_force will get my custom for all batteries and bulbs from now on .
positive	live the updates through the day when flowers are on way x
positive	correct product in a timely_fashion
negative	i was then told there was nothing they could do and was given a customer service number to ring .
neutral	i ordered a data cabinet from kenable - had to order 0 times as the first two i selected paypal as the payment type and nothing turned_up .
negative	secondly the delivery : i '_ve had one delivery where they couldn_'_t find my house so kept trying to deliver it to another house on the wrong street .
negative	sent and faxed more security confirmation information than requested and still opodo couldn_'_t deliver .
negative	i find that the product is of poor quality and their customer_services are very inefficient compared to other on line companies .
negative	the customer service experience was the double shotgun to both feet again .
positive	placed two_separate_orders , one by phone and one on the internet .
negative	i booked 0 tickets coming_back from belgrade to london .
negative	i eventually had to go through paypal just to get the small discount i requested .
negative	i left an honest appraisal of the company on here and was shocked to find my review had been taken off as it had been reported as false .
positive	coat arrived within a few_days , excellent service - would definately use all_weathers again
neutral	they are far to big for the cards which doesn_'_t reflect the quality of overall package i had hoped for .
positive	excellent .
positive	simplysupplements , i rate as 0st_class in price , speed of delivery & quality of merchandise . none to beat them !
negative	you people are the scum of the earth
positive	the site said my two phones were worth £_00 .
negative	so nice to think i have been relegated to the realms of a fraudster - what a nice way of speaking to a customer with a genuine complaint
neutral	i had a quick response saying they would be shipped the next_day , not sure why they weren_'_t in the first place when they were in stock .
positive	would definitely use again .
negative	* unprofessional
positive	i found the site quite easy to use , delivery was prompt and parcel well_packaged
negative	i was just beginning to trust this company and had placed my third order . received email to say order would be delivered next_day , nothing arrived , no explanation , all day wasted .
neutral	traveling friday .
positive	very easy to use website . ordering couldn_'_t be easier . delivery speedy and packaging excellent . would defintately use again :)
neutral	i tried not to let this spoil our journey and decided to purchase water or a can of red bull instead of the overpriced draught coke .
positive	there are some great discounts and delivery is fast .
neutral	and again was left with water in .
negative	bought a 0 . 00 item from them tempted by the cheap price but as they say you gets what you pay for and in my case that was nothing but a pile of extra work .
positive	i would not_hesitate to use these_guys , easy ordering , i even requested economy delivery for nine days and it still arrived in 0 !!
positive	i will use fleetway , hopefully they will offer me some bargain again !
positive	good quality .
neutral	two suggestions would be : a ) if there are problems , just a short e_- mail to the customer really helps , and b ) if an order is being chased , again a simple " human " response would be appreciated , even if it just says " we ' re looking into it ".
positive	( i think they got the price wrong . but let '_s keep that between ourselves )
positive	this is a very yummy perfume .
neutral	quality , fit and price are great .
neutral	disappointed that what was on offer could not be delivered
positive	i will be using buyabattery for all my future battery purchases .
neutral	upon making the booking , i booked a volkswagen_golf ' or something similar '.
negative	my sister '_s phone is t - mobile and it is amazing !
positive	i signed_up then and there .
neutral	however , the argos reservation system is a real nightmare , sometimes it shows an item as not available , then if you try again , it is available .
neutral	come on trustpilot ,
neutral	my reservations are due to the clunkiness of the user experience ; if i didn_'_t know exactly_what i was shopping for i am sure it would be worse .
negative	i think they are rob dogs they charge to much for using papal . i wont have nothing paid into paypal as they want a arm & a leg for using them . no thanks
neutral	i know we could arrange for collection etc but you have to keep the boxes for return and they are so big you can '_t get the furniture out of them and keep them in one piece .
positive	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
negative	for nearly_£_00 i '_m massively disappointed .
positive	the prices are very competitive and my delivery arrived the next_day , which was 0 days earlier_than_anticipated .
negative	after 00mins talking on phone they told me a guy called " akman " signed and received my parcel and they told me i have to wait up to 0 days for asking the driver and these stuffs .
neutral	plus , i have sky , which has better channels for the money .
neutral	also not getting rewards on sale items and other things is not fair on the person running the catalogue .
negative	one item was a monitor .
positive	had a great selection of bow_ties , silk and man made .
negative	numerous_emails chasing my order have failed to extract a despatch date from them .
positive	we couldn_'_t recommend steven (& therefore graphics & print ) highly_enough .
positive	the delivery prompt and the communication was excellent
neutral	broadband was a very different experience , the lady in the store was a bit clueless and tried to sell me something that wasn_'_t in the system at that time - therefore not able to process a transaction .
neutral	when i had not heard_anything i phoned the centre to be told that they were there , i went and had them fitted which didn_'_t take long .
negative	in 0000 it is unacceptable for a company in the channel to take money off a customer promise delivery and miss that schedule by 0_weeks .
negative	lies all around about broadband_speed , absolute nonsense on my bill , no relevance to required payment and billed quantities whatsoever !
neutral	i bought a carseat - britax_kidfix ( isofix ) - looked a good price on the web , clear delivery policy , and a company based close to where i live ( fewer delivery miles ).
positive	great service , thank_you x
neutral	i strongly_recommend it to others . it is however , far from perfect .
neutral	when collecting the car which had been washed noticed a note under the wipers informing i had a flat_tyre , this was left on the back of a shopping list obviously left by a kind passer_by from the nearby garden_centre . i cannot_believe that the staff at ford had repaired the car . hopefully test driven it , washed it and failed to notice or inflate the tyre .
negative	ordered a nexus_0 tablet which was stated to be in stock on their web - site on dec 0st .
positive	if inconvenient to me it could have been changed .
positive	buggy £_00 cheaper_than else where arrived by dpd the next_day !
positive	my return - for a prebooked parking - was delayed by over 00_hours , i was impressed by the fairness of the additional_charge .
positive	very easy to order .
positive	i am always being asked from where it was obtained , and i am only too happy to pass on the details of such a fantastic service .

negative	i was not at all impressed with this as i didn_'_t notice it until after i had paid , but decided to leave it as it was mother '_s day .
negative	david : yodel have delivered this in error , are you saying i have to pay for yodels mistake ?
positive	will be ordering from them in future .
neutral	i think this company is basically sound but when you hand over several_hundred_pounds it does make you sweat a little when you cannot get hold of a human_being , customer service needs some working on and then they would be a great little company and no doubt pick_up far more business !
negative	!
neutral	i tried to order for the saturday , as the birthday was on sunday but i could not get the site to work so ended_up getting there late .
neutral	0 ) despite_being in stock it took almost a week to dispatch
negative	it was a very unpleasant experience that i hope no one else has to go through .
negative	in my view , this time frame is unreasonable .
neutral	i was at the address the whole time - he just couldn_'_t be_bothered to drive by .
neutral	00 broken_tiles at time of delivery .
neutral	the packing instructions you receive with the envelope say that basic insurance ( up to £_00 ) is included in the service and that you should consider paying extra to get more insurance but when i went to the post_office they confirmed that the pre_- pay category included no insurance and you have to pay extra if you want any .
positive	very easy and useful service .
neutral	we took this up with staff explaining about the menu in the cabin , after some time we were refunded all money additional including drinks which we were happy about .
negative	not just that , the barcode generated for collect_plus was rejected at the collection_point necessitating a trip home to sort_out the issue then a return to the shop .
positive	andrew was able to sit with me and together we agreed a specification for the laptop .
negative	i complained to corporate headquarters and they were worse than useless
positive	it '_s now saved to our browser shopping favourites .

neutral	dreadful .
positive	i would recommend them top anyone .
neutral	yes , she syas and does it .
positive	where else do you get customer service like that ?
positive	safe , secure , and a good bunch to help you out :)
neutral	the flowers were delivered on the correct day , one bunch was requested after 0pm but was delivered earlier so surprise was ruined .
negative	myukdelivery emailed me back at 00 . 00 ( bear in mind i had told them i had left for the hospital and given my phone number ) to say
negative	i ordered the brave blu_ray for my daughter '_s birthday ( which was yesterday ).
positive	fully_understood what i required , explained that it could be returned if_necessary .

neutral	he delivered everything with total truth and honesty and went out of his way to explain all the facts .
positive	excellent service from_start to finish .
neutral	( lisa i think ) probably owing me £_00 + probably much more .
neutral	however , i ordered two photo_books ( via amazon loacal deals ), but had to have them delivered separately .
positive	i also like that you can make a personalized account and you can show others where you have traveled !
neutral	well impressive online offer if you bought 0 tyres , so i did and booked appointment .
positive	no_problems - though to be fair , all i have done is pay for , and receive documents . so 0_stars for contact so_far .
negative	they answer easy emails and ignore difficult ones !
negative	by this time the last order date was approaching .
positive	i receive my camera in 0 days without paying any aditional charges .
positive	they offer good value for money and delivery was on time .
positive	only ever had one problem which was resolved by the customer service team !
negative	it does not say this anywhere on the help or faq_section or on the website when you click to have it delivered on a saturday , it actually says "
negative	now i '_m trying to cancel the order but the store does not answer me .
neutral	very helpful people , arranged for courier to deliver the correct item and take away the wrong one , but by now my builder and plumber had wasted five days .
neutral	beware there are no nicad batteries included in the sale .
neutral	always used vodafone on my mobiles throughout the years , they are pretty reliable , never had a problem with them , the signal is sloppy in certain_areas but i imagine thats the case with most of the network_providers .
positive	hi , i ordered medication not knowing weather it would arrive or not as i hadn_'_t done anything like this before , but i '_m pleased to say everything came on the following_day .
negative	them : " just keep checking the tracking_information every day …"
negative	i used to book directly with gulf air online after checking prices of same distenation tickets online . if i need to cancel or change with gulf air most of the time they charge me nothing . this time i have booked two tickets with e_- booker to fly on gulf air for an amount of gb 000 . 0 when i wanted to cancele i got penalized one full ticket price . ihe refund amount will almost gb 000_+ few_pounds .
negative	they '_ve been out 0 times over the last 00 weeks in winstone , glos to install a phone / internet line .
positive	simple , stress_free , trustworthy and really impressive .
positive	we can get you on the 0pm .
neutral	sometimes you '_ll call 000 and get someone_who seems to know what they ' re doing and leave you with a pleasant_experience while 00_% of the time , you might come_across someone that doesn_'_t appear to know either what '_s going on .
neutral	but was advised to wait 00 days before contacting them again .
neutral	complain_about this and you will receive no apology .
positive	although you can buy slightly_cheaper on the web , i prefer top quality products that i can trust with great service at a competitive price . the choc was a nice_touch too !
positive	definitely recommend .
neutral	i was ordering pet_food and after 0_days , i hadn_'_t received it .
neutral	the result was magnificent on my face , the products i bought helped_me to maintain the good quality of mis skin and i am comfortable of using them .
neutral	i looked to see whether there was a charge for using a credit_card because i know that most companies apply them these days .
negative	simple - i will not be using serenata again .
negative	the 0nd part of the order was delivered as requested but the flowers by no means matched up to what was ordered - very small for the money paid .
neutral	having said that , overall , i was very glad to have found them .
positive	service was super_fast and the delivery driver was so nice and friendly .
neutral	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
positive	couldn_'_t be better .
positive	delivery prompt .
positive	perfume arrived much earlier_than i expected .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time and were well_presented .
neutral	better packaging might be a good idea to prevent this from happening .
negative	however , the bouquet that arrived was totally different from what '_s advertised - ' tequila sunrise ' is described as a ' bouquet in vibrant greens and orange ', with ' lime_green kermit chrysanthemums with bright_orange miniature gerberas and burnt_orange lilies '.
neutral	now i know that , the site is fine ( i think !
positive	fast shipping , even for international sales .
neutral	had there been any_problems i would not have been very happy .
neutral	this is very unfortunate as i have enjoyed buying from cheapsmells for some years_now .
positive	great item - great price .
neutral	enquired when we arrived , but hotel full , so no oportunity of any change of room .
neutral	i even have the correct_address on my invoice .
negative	this time they tell me there is a technical_issue with my form of payment ( paypal ) which is why it did not take my request .
negative	every time my wife or i have a new mobile from virgin , yodel never deliver when they say they will .
positive	often the orders have been placed late the previous day due to me being disorganised .
negative	the freesia one i picked was full of colors , today she sent me a thank_you note with a picture of the bouquet and it looked nothing like the one i had purchased for her .
positive	after_searching on the net for a decent pair of dj headphones ( possibly with a mic cable for mobile_phone use ), i came_across juno . co . uk reviews on their top ten dj headphones .
negative	shortly_after this , had a call from my bank about fraudulent transactions being made using my credit_card_details . my order with crazycameras was the only time i used that card in a long time , so it was most_likely related to these fraudsters and thieves !
positive	as always , first_class service from a reliable online pharmacy .
positive	why wouldn_'_t you want to get money back off of your online purchases ?
positive	next time , hifi_gear will be my first_port of call !
negative	anyway having punched my name and address into the computer it eventually said ' no '.
negative	there is absolutely no warning on the text about the charges of ringing this number which begins " 00000 " and looks_like an ordinary mobile .
neutral	he didn_'_t so i cancelled the order the next_day .
negative	lost items .
neutral	i had to contact the supplier and ask for one that was appropriate for my vehicle , and recieved another curt reply - there is none available for your model of car .
negative	avoid at all costs .
neutral	i even paid_extra for the deluxe_version and was gobsmacked at how they arrived - i expected a lovely bouquet well put_together with foliage and actually got two little bouquets - no foliage at all - it was unlike any flower delivery i had seen .
neutral	not happy with the care taking over my parcel .
positive	one stop shopping the way i like it !
negative	i have only just found the list of people disatisfied with this company . too late as i too have experienced the same probems . no reply to emails .
negative	as for the flowers themselves apart_from waiting on lily '_s blooming the rest where very poor looking and i feel i would have been better off going to asda and getting a bunch much_nicer for half the price .
neutral	i then received one radiator which was the incorrect_size .
neutral	ebays site is brill , easy to use and well_protected , but they should cap the p_&_p_charges in all categories not just some , someone wanted £_00 delivery for a hardrive u can put in a jiffy_bag an post for less_than £ 0 .
negative	so here is my review you go stick your crap company right where it should be !!
negative	i put my order at the same time as my housemate , she got hers 0_days afterwards .
positive	would highly commend them to anyone .
neutral	i bought a wath from there and i took it back because it kept loosing time .
neutral	but when things go_wrong no one knows where the deliveries are , when they will get here and when they have gone_missing , i get you save_money sending them in bulk from what ever third world country makes them but it doesn_'_t work .
neutral	another negative is the fact that the voucher they send is only valid for a week from the date they send it out .
negative	they are an_absolute_disgrace , lure you in with a high price and then knock you down .
positive	fast , friendly service
negative	took photos of the wheel arch for proof of condition and also how it was packaged up so there would be no come_back .
positive	at first l found the prospect of creating my photobook daunting , but the more l progressed through the web_site , the easier it became .
negative	!
neutral	both he and the other boys in his dorm complained to his coach / leader who gave numerous warnings to them but nothing else .
neutral	i will not be ordering from them again .
positive	i was searching the web for a gretsch mandolin ; various of the big - name web guitar / music - gear shops showed " call us for availability " but rich_tone showed one in stock ; price including p_&_p was no more than the other stores .
neutral	to be fair to the children , they were very well behaved .
neutral	this left me feeling my time was spent on something that a shool child could have done instead of my wanting to gain more advanced knowledge on the subject .
neutral	the web_site was very frustrating .
negative	however i did provide a contact telephone_number which was switched on and with me the entire day .
positive	bravo !!!!
neutral	tristan
neutral	had an_email argument with the " customer service " guy_who pointed_out that this charge was listed in the " more info " link , but you had to go right to the bottom of the q & a small_print to find out about this charge , which really wasn_'_t obvious - it definitely could have been better communicated , so watch out !
negative	you sent me the wrong item , and then took months to correct it .
neutral	anyway so i soaked it in disinfectant and bunged it in the wash . it ’_s the reason for 0_stars otherwise it would have been 0 .
negative	i ordered category 0 tickets for france v england in 0 nations 0000 .
neutral	my order has not arrived yet so i cannot_comment .
negative	the call_centre fails to deal with the most basic of enquiries .
neutral	why did it take 00 days ?
positive	a great service giving extensive product range at a good price .
neutral	i would appreciate being told before not after payment !
positive	clive
neutral	disappointing - for the price you pay you should be able to expect excellent results .
neutral	it '_s great that the website has a search_function that allows you to eliminate certain ingredients , such as pork ; not so great when you can '_t trust it , and you end up with food you can '_t eat .
positive	thanks
negative	which was on stated in the ticket description .
neutral	0 pouches were ripped and 0 tin lids were crushed .
positive	good quality product and fast service , i would recommend this company
negative	!
positive	really helpful staff and great products , i spend way too much money here but will be back to spend more soon .
positive	orders always arrive on time , when there is a problem the staff are really helpful when i call .
negative	do i just wait as it is meant to be a guaranteed delivery .
positive	its refreshing to order a product at midday and receive it at 00 am the next_day .
positive	its so easy collect your old_mobiles send them to mazuma and wait for the money
neutral	why did i waste my time and effort buying a quality product from the middleman ?
positive	tickets arrived within a couple of days even_though its only august_0000 .
neutral	they are quite cheap but the first item i ordered ( a white quilted_jacket ) had black dots randomly on it .
positive	meat quality is perfect .
positive	item as_described and arrived on time .
negative	no joy .
neutral	placed my order but not despatched till 0th_jan also not sure about measurements stated on site think i will now measure the mac which is not waxy but shiny
negative	on top of this - one week_later the refund had not been sent and had to be sought by opening a paypal_dispute .
neutral	on arrival of the installation engineer it became_clear that most of what we had asked for over the phone 0 months previously had not been updated on the records so we had a desperate morning liasing between the engineer and their customer service to make_sure everything was as we wanted .
negative	she can really help and keeps her word .
positive	i live in finalnd but i order all my cloths from chemical record even high shipment payments i don_'_t care .
negative	not happy at all and i will be complaining to partyrama
positive	brilliant service .
neutral	this experience won_'_t put me off as in most_cases described in these reviews everything_went well .
positive	arrived on time .
negative	having found the same product on ebay i ordered from pdol0000 but did not realise they are the same company and same thing happened only it took them four days to issue a refund through paypal which is now being held (£_00 ) and won_'_t be available to me until goodness_knows when .
neutral	i have no doubts that orbit_print would have rectified these issues had they received the canvas back - but unfortunately i can '_t provide feedback on this .
positive	a great customer service experience overall and i love my vulpine merino_wool jersey !
positive	!
positive	i have actually introduced numerous friends to you .
negative	it was not made clear when i made the booking how the insurance works and that is shoddy in my opinion .
neutral	it would have been helpful if i had clearer or any guidance on the fuel required for the particular vehicle
positive	they are ok
neutral	was a bit disappointed that we had to wait over 00_minutes for our car to be collected at 0am on the way out as we have a 0 year_old who was very tired .
negative	if you read this and are thinking of ordering with this company then please take the best advice possible and order elsewhere , whatever the occassion you want flowers for then do not let this company take your money and ruin the occassion .
negative	buy a pigeon , clip its wings and blindfold it .
neutral	i thought fresh flowers should have lasted_longer
negative	you ' re already now down to six hours paid working time if you could manage that speed !
positive	i have enjoyed this site so much , has great games to play and the host are pleasant and are always informed so if there is a problem they let us know straight_away
positive	ordered three different dresses for size and style and kept one .
neutral	iceland send products to the overseas company in spain , they should make_sure that the expats in spain are not ripped_off by overseas ,
negative	i phoned their tech_support ( in mumbai ) who would not listen to me ( i am an ex - college lecturer in pc programming and maintenance and know a bit about how computers work ).
neutral	i went through the order procedure asking to collect in store , but saw that the price to pay was the full_amount .
positive	reasonable price and next_day delivery avoids the hassle of collecting from my optician
negative	without_doubt the worst couriers i '_ve ever had to deal with and that '_s not just one experience sadly !!
neutral	our product has arrived after 0 missed delivery dates , we were advised that they had been let_down by the 0rd_party supplier and their specialist courier but it was eventually delivered by tnt so not sure what happened there .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from you .
neutral	their stock_availability needs to be addressed , although i am very happy with the items i '_ve managed to buy so far .
negative	“ hi james
negative	waited another 0_weeks . still no refund . chap on phone was very rude as i paid by card , and not on account " how can you have purchased from us if you dont have an account number ?"
negative	despite us being in the house waiting for an important delivery , the apc driver made no attempt to deliver our parcel and didn_'_t knock on the door or ring the doorbell .
positive	i can always_rely_on feel good contact_lenses to deliver efficiently and to purchase is very painless .
negative	but thats not the best bit . bulk_powders are now running a free delivery promotion . so yes you guessed it . still paying for delivery . shocking !
negative	on trying to resolve the issue , i was given a managerial number to call - to which i called numerous_times however the person was contently away at lunch and unavailable .
neutral	no assistance offered & items impossible for elderly customer to unwrap .
neutral	apart_from that the selection is first_rate .
negative	this they did and a day was arranged for the uplift .
negative	i was upset to be treated so , my whole journey through the night was miserable .
negative	the call never came , i called them back to find they ' re closed on saturdays , so i mailed them again and i am awaiting a reply .
negative	i have therefore asked for my order to be cancelled and an immediate_refund be made .
neutral	i was so impressed with virgin that as soon as my agreement with sky has finished i '_m defiantly going with virgin_media .
positive	enough said !
positive	site was easy to use and purchase from , delivery was very fast .
neutral	on line is my only option as there are no ecco shops in skipton .
negative	review regarding a go pro hero 0 black motor edition ordered on the 00 / 00 /_0000 yes 0000 , not posted due to me mentioning one christian name who sent me an email and speaking honestly !, nonetheless less they still have my money and i , nearly 00 months later do not have the goods , come on proviation get your act_together and give me what is mine !
negative	i ' d used this company last_year and they were fine .
positive	easy experience with a good outcome
positive	an internet_search will make it obvious how competitive viovet '_s prices are but not until you place an order will you realise how good the delivery service is .
negative	at this point i '_ve given up trying to return the item or get a refund .
negative	overall , not great - 0 / 0 products were not fit for purpose , and one of those is unable to be tested due to the uncommon power_supply needed .
neutral	great website .
positive	item as_described and very quick delivery
negative	the membership has now expired but i just received an email from them today asking me to renew it .
positive	very pleased with the two barbour_coats i purchased .

negative	lesson_learnt . never order from here again !
neutral	i received the parcel today from fedex and although i know that the courier is paid according to weight or volume , i was very surprised to see that my items were in a box about 00 cm x 00 cm and actually only just covered the floor of the box , the rest was empty air .
negative	again !

negative	won_'_t be using these_cowboys again
positive	i am one happy person .
positive	i found the site .
positive	i was very happy with the case when it arrived . it looks great , you just can '_t get great unique designs like this in the uk .
neutral	christmas_eve after sending go - electrical a message they told me they were waiting for a delivery from roberts .
negative	i would not recommend them due to this situation and their poor choice of films available instantly .
positive	they arrived within 00_hours too !
neutral	i expected some lifting but i also expected a delivery driver with the right equipment for a product like this so at_least the pallet could have gone to my back door
neutral	it could not hold a tune , wrongly spaced frets .
negative	we have had to wait one month for half the brushes to arrive ( long past said birthday !)
neutral	i found the prices fair and the options for bulk buy are useful .
neutral	one drawback of this site so_far is that my order still_hasn_'_t arrived and its been almost 0_weeks
neutral	it is a little_confusing for a child to understand that .
positive	within 0 minutes i had a reply saying the amendment had been done !
neutral	i '_m hoping that the other 0 steaks in the pack are more tender to eat .
positive	i found the website very easy to use and found a suitable wetsuit at an extremely reasonable_price within about 0 minutes of looking .

neutral	this cottage was booked by me for my mum and dad plus an aunt and uncle .
neutral	freddie mercury x
negative	yep you got it , row 00 in a standing area so my son will have no chance of seeing anything .
negative	please bear in mind that once a refund has_been issued it can take up to 0 working_days for the transaction to show on your statement .
negative	this company is a joke and my sons_birthday_present and dream of seeing his idols up close is totally_ruined .
positive	it can be a struggle finding the perfectly fitting frame and sending something away to be framed can take an age .
neutral	transport is not included in the cost so the cost of taxis everywhere added to the cost of the weekend .
negative	further , the threats and penalties given on the voucher have caused my
neutral	i saw nothing on the website to say this , so the first i knew was when i got an email from city_link . saying they would deliver that day , and would need a signature for the parcel .
neutral	sarah
negative	reconciling my bank_account a week or so later highlighted that they had charged me twice for the item once on the 00th_november_0000 , once on the 0rd_december_0000 .
positive	postage is fast and free ( on orders over £_00 ), and very well_packed !
positive	received a valuation that i was happy with and arranged to make the sale .
neutral	my sunglasses arrive in a bashed and dented box , the case has seen better days and i feel very disapointed .
negative	non professional is the word and money grabbing is another !
positive	high_quality goods arrived in perfect_condition at the time specified .
neutral	the delivery also didn_'_t include the furniture wax in the order .
positive	what i wanted , when i wanted it and at a price definitely liked
positive	took printed copy with id to ticket office and issued tickets straight_away .
positive	i won_'_t be using any other company now .
negative	after i google a new number and ring around 00 times , i get a delivery date for the following week . low and behold they do not show .
negative	drove 000_miles to test_drive a car in solihull - they forgot i was coming .
neutral	it encourages uneconomical driving as you feel that you want to use up the fuel that you have been made to pay for .
positive	great choice of beers , and now with the new website you know how many they have in stock .
negative	however i was not ringing them for that reason so obviously telepathy is not a strong point at orange .
negative	bought a viseo 000t touchscreen .
positive	the service was fantastic .
positive	beats all other_sites and high_st .
positive	great prices and very helpful staff .
positive	i '_ve always looked around each time i '_ve needed to by worm or flea_treatments to get the best price - but i now return to animed as a matter of course due to their quick service and consistently low_prices .
positive	very well made and looks beautiful .
negative	there is no telephone_number to speak to anybody and i have sent three emails asking where my goods are and no reply .
negative	i cancelled the order and received a reply saying the money had been refunded .
neutral	no tip .
neutral	one pair shoes fitted brilliantly and the short boots were too narrow at the heel .
neutral	i can get a box sent from the uk with a £ 0 . 00 delivery cost and receive it in 0 days .

neutral	i have had no_problems with the products themselves and delivery is prompt .
positive	thank_you very much .!
positive	i would definitely use again .
neutral	normally i ' d give at_least four_stars , so to punish one shockingly_bad_experience by ignoring everything that has_gone right in the past and only giving one star now is not entirely fair .
positive	i have just purchased a third watch from watch_finder .
negative	i tried to contact them several_times afterwards but they never responded and never_let_me know the outcome of their investigation into the detail of the call .
negative	and as wikipedia puts it , a major british road .
negative	other than this major_issue ( and the non - communication ) i had no issues , the part was as_described and my shower is working again .
neutral	firstly calling to offer additional boosts to save call costs when the boost would cost more than my total call costs !
negative	we have not gone back to that mcdonalds since ( they are always messing up orders & are rude ) & when i complained to mcdonalds customer service all i got told was that the restaurant in question was a franchise & basically not their problem but they would pass on my comments & details & that i would hear back from the manager , well that was two_weeks_ago . still_waiting ., well_done mcdonalds your customer service is non exsistant and i will not be " dinning " in any of your branches again .

positive	would definately_recomend and i will gladly continue using them .
positive	a friend of ours owns an apartment in spain which we could have for a week so we thought " spain here we come ".
neutral	everything was fine
negative	im not happy with this company the reason_why is down to the way they treated my neighbour ,
positive	only_downside is there constant efforts to change " my ebay " the latest changes included putting the " selling " section on another page , removing it for the general overview page . in context its only one extra click to check your selling items !
neutral	unfortunately i arrived to pick_up my car at gatwick_airport when the normal pick - up place had apparently been flooded out .
positive	this is the first time i have bought anything from petfleas but it will not be the last .
positive	i also had a problem at the checkout which was fixed immediately by a very helpful customer service staff .
positive	when i '_ve had my servicing and mots done there , they have always been straightforward to deal with , clear about any_problems and i feel_confident in their advice .
positive	would certainly use again .
neutral	however , i would return as i liked the website and understand mistakes can happen .
positive	simples
neutral	after the phone_call i received a dispatch email .
negative	because of the time difference , i knew it wouldn_'_t be posted until monday 00th_september when i duly received the shipping confirmation and tracking_number .
positive	great price on a merida juliet 00 .

negative	two_weeks_later another guy came on the same errand .

neutral	their response was simply " your parcel has_been dispatched and therefore we can amend any prices ".
neutral	when they did the service was fast and efficient .
neutral	they said they would get them sent to the hotel we were staying at in london if they hadn_'_t come by thursday .
negative	huge loss to a little british struggling manufacturer .

neutral	the seats , as promised , were fantastic , block b , row j - 0 rows from the stage .
neutral	have just had a phone_call from the sales_manager who i have to say was the total_opposite very polite and offered a full_refund plus free mugs so for this reason i will make it 0_stars and when all goes through will make more stars .

negative	flowers arrived 0th_feb and ion time for my mothers_birthday however they were wilting and not fit to display so unfortunate as my mum was of ill_health and sadly_died 0_days_later it was her 00th on their arrival i reassured her that i would contact the company and try and put things right despite my e_-_mails to serenata they have not replied as yet
neutral	a piece of the mask was detached so i had to glue it back together and it looks like the feathers had been cut as there were loose pieces in the packaging and they were odd in shape .

neutral	went to drive off to find the door was open again !
negative	low_prices are not everything you have to be confident you are going to get what you paid for within the timescales contracted for or at the very least be kept_informed , things_happen but not knowing is hard to deal with .
negative	sometimes i cant make a phone_call because there '_s something wrong with the server .
positive	although they probably will be glad never to have me buy from them again , i would recommend them to anyone ; great prices and first_class service .
neutral	tel : 0000 000 0000
neutral	well we argued and argued until dreams finally got the bed to us two_weeks late and gave_us a cheque for £_000 .
positive	the main and most_important_thing on their website is the competition pricing .
negative	they are now not answering any emails ( other than automated_reply ), i put a post about poor service on their facebook_page which did get a response but they tell me they will have to transfer me as " its not their department ".
negative	my advice ?
neutral	when i asked the receptionist about this paper she explained that the printspace did not use it .
negative	i had a reply_saying it hadnt been dispatched yet , that one of the items was out of stock but i would get a refund and the rest of the order would be sent .
negative	thought it seemed too good to be true .
neutral	specifically_asked not to replace my order if item not available but it was still replaced with something_else .
positive	thanks again for your help and great service .
positive	i had my eye on a particular colour of jacket and outdoor_kit seemed to be the only stockist in the land who had the colour / size in stock that i wanted ( the north_face nuptse in fissure green , size medium !).
neutral	hotel not as good as expected - looked in need of a refurb , but the staff were friendly & the food good .
negative	four days_later i received an email_saying the item had been despatched .
negative	i am writing to them .
neutral	towbar was a good price , and delivery was as stated , but the guy on the phone was abrupt and unhelpful .
negative	i bought a item online and was given the option of getting the item deliverd to a different address that the my card was registerd to .
neutral	have always been happy with freshcig very prompt delivery and products usually spot_on .
neutral	and this prolonged the installation of the new bathroom
neutral	however , the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired as they have come out grainy even_though we used pictures taken on the raw setting on the dslr .
negative	i phoned orange ( who employed dpd for some unknown_reason ) and they agreed to send my new iphone to my work address for monday and emailed their dpd contact to arrange the consignment .

negative	i live in glasgow where ryanair are the only company to provide budget_air travel .
neutral	yours_sincerely
negative	i would not recommend this company to my worst_enemy , and as far as i '_m concerned they should refund me every_penny i have paid them as they are incapable of fixing anything .
positive	i needed to order some vietnamese dong but your company did not seem to handle this particular currency .
neutral	amended to 0_stars from 0 : as i said , to be fair to westin , they seem to have been let_down by parcelforce .
negative	after 00 days from order i still have no my items , delivery failed , my money are lost
negative	i ask the person serving me how i do this , he states that theres a 00min wait for the cancellation team for chat and call .

positive	just received a photo , from my relatives in england , of the bouquet i sent for their 00th_wedding_anniversary .
neutral	handyman skills required to install but no more .

neutral	mob : 00000000000
positive	flourescent tubes packed very well for transit .
positive	great value and very please with the two i bought .
positive	opted for free del but product del next_day .
negative	you are fine so long as there is no issues with your order .
neutral	secondly , my blinds are brilliant white and the stiffening bars used to construct the blind are off - white and therefore look yellowish through the blind .
negative	they never used to be like this , buyers_beware !
neutral	what is the point of ths site if the company who gives bad service or sells rubbish stuff can get the reviews removed ?
positive	just what you expect in this day and age and can '_t fault it one bit .
negative	i phoned them and they could not beat the offer i had but then they gave in and made it a little cheaper , so i stayed !!
neutral	nether time have i received this valuable email .
neutral	if the website wasn_'_t covered in customer testimonies saying how quick delivery was , i might have noticed the small_print about possible delivery time - but over three_weeks from intial order is ridiculous for one t - shirt .
positive	really easy to talk to and frendly
negative	finally today after trying to contact by email and telephone i requested my order just be cancelled .
negative	i can '_t even send a secure message to them .
neutral	had expected the record to be packaged with stiffeners as juno used to always do this in the past .
neutral	for more information see our shipping policy page .
negative	the dead twig i received was so waterlogged there was green slime covering the surface of compost and grey mould growing up the twig .
neutral	not good customer service for new customers though
positive	so lets get busy and start using it

neutral	on the same day furniture arrived from rival company - items unloaded , assembled & positioned - even changed lightbulb in room as customer unable to reach !!!
neutral	ordered 0gb_ram on the 00th midday .
positive	fantsatic service .
positive	highly_recommend this website !!!
negative	", she obviously knows_how poor the company is .
neutral	we ordered an incorrect door , and also had received one incorrectly without_any hinge_holes ( not our fault ) but the staff had no concern about urgency of the order and kept referring back to their supplier , who seems to dictate .
neutral	having taken gees linctus since_childhood , and found there is nothing to compare with it for soothing a really bad chesty cough , i was horrified to find that chemist '_s no long stock it . however , still available on the chemist_direct website .
neutral	i still use them for stuff that is not time critical due totally to their cheap pricing .
negative	which never turned_up .
negative	this company is a farce - do not waste your money with them .
neutral	beware that first_class delivery can take up to 0 days !
positive	i '_ll be ordering more products from this company !
positive	phones answered quickly and politely .
neutral	at the time i needed the product urgently but did not agree wiht the postage_costs i was to incur , so i left the items in my shopping_cart but logged off .
negative	i say support as its clear that is your interest .
positive	all very smooth , if you had to be picky the box it was in was slightly crushed but it is only getting thrown_away so what does it matter ?
neutral	also the fact that customer service kept ignoring my emails was really frustrating .
neutral	i had been looking for brown buckwheat to cook in a traditional russian way for a while but could only find its green type until i came_across this site .
neutral	the bag arrived very quickly . unfortunately when using it for the first time in natural daylight have noticed some discolouring in the canvas .
negative	it is just a ripp off .
negative	however on return from a lovely holiday i was met with rudeness that turned into a very horrible situation where i felt intimidated and vulnerable .
neutral	the courier company never pick_up their phone .
positive	what service !
negative	whilst talking to her .
negative	it seems argos are happy to sell items they do not have in stock and give customers completely made up delivery dates just to make a sale .
positive	wow what service !
neutral	despite following this up no satisfactory reply has_been received only " looking into it ".
negative	when we were advised about it a day or so later - the sole iceblock had melted and we had a box of rotten meat .
positive	outstanding !
positive	it is the first time i have used mazumamobile , i found it to be a good , fast and reliable service , the online shop was very helpful , so yes i would recommend this shop to others .
neutral	i also emailed serenata about the deliver disappointment and have yet to receive reply or comment , disappointed but not to the extent i would not use serenata again .
positive	recommended .
negative	all down_hill after this .
neutral	so adding up : 000_euro for the car , 00 euro insurance at rentalcars . com , plus 00 euro insurance at hertz !!!
neutral	the only problem was the customer service and the guarantee .
neutral	( the sizes were different depending_on the brand ).
positive	well recommended for all motoring needs , 0 * company , fast despatch , great prices too , cheers shaun .
neutral	both_times the hard_disk was floating about loose in the packing box .
neutral	i have recently used serenata_flowers on 0 occasions , both_times with a discount_code
negative	i had used lastminute before and recommended them to friends for their reasonably_priced hotels .
positive	some get it , some dont get it - but those who sign up and take 0 minutes to browse the website have thanked_me .
positive	i would definatley use this company again before the big companies such as curry '_s argos and john_lewis .
positive	the artisan_naturals mattress i bought is blissfully comfortable and top quality .
positive	my mum said the flowers were beautiful and came with such a lovely message on how to take care of the flowers .
negative	in march_0000 we are informed by hoetelsclick . com that our booking is cancelled .
neutral	also , it is impossible to book an_appointment any further ahead than 0_weeks as their computer_systems can '_t cope with this .
negative	would never recommend or use this company for their sheer lack of incompetence and poor customer service .
positive	i made my first order last_week , prices were very competitive and delivery was very fast .
negative	there was no battery_charger included and the electicals inside wasnt connected to the motor properly .
positive	thank_you
negative	order before_midnight for christmas delivery ' liars do not order as you wont get it before xmas and you wont_be able to get a refund to replace what you wont get !!!
neutral	surely not fair .
negative	this was utter bullshit , they realised they had made an_error with the price and wouldnt honour it , so come up with this rubbish about being sold in store .
positive	goods matched the website - i got what i wanted
negative	!
negative	imagine my surprise when , low and behold , i did receive an_email from them , but only to happily inform_me that the taps i had asked them to cancel has_been despatched !!!
positive	if only all delivery companies were like buyaparcel .
neutral	hope you can help me .
positive	perfect , next_day delivery and a bargain price
neutral	i felt duped in all honesty .
negative	the cost was high - 000_euros plus a small additional_charge for some unknown_reason .
negative	this wasted a day because i later found that the model i bought won_'_t use this version .
positive	services also very friendly .
neutral	took 00_minutes for customer service to answer phone , twice .
neutral	the village name and last 0 characters of the post_code had been omitted .
negative	this subsequently made me late for work as i was going straight to work from the airport .
neutral	having purchased items from local cex stores i bought what i thought to be a boxed set of skylanders figures from their on line store as the set was not available locally .
neutral	initial no_hassle booking at fairly short_notice .
positive	easy , quick and such a quick delivery .
positive	was so quick and easy !!
positive	absolutely_faultless . from the ease of the website to order jacket from . to the confirmation and delivery .
negative	tachodisc will not re - licence the software even_though it is being installed on the same computer with a new hard_drive ,,, they insist we buy the software again ,, i seriously doubt that is going to happen
negative	i will not consider_using them again .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable and is not a safe location - all of my neighbours are happy to keep parcels on my behalf and do so on a regular_basis with all other delivery services i have used .
negative	in fairness , having made my disappointment apparent in the form of an e_- mail , they were quick to respond and i received a full_refund .
positive	next_day delivery was brilliant and great value for money .
negative	this will be my one and only experience of flying with tap .
negative	it took 00 days to be despatched ( compare this to amazon and virtually every other online_retailer with same day or next_day despatch ).
neutral	this impressed my as i had anticipated having to " prove " i hadn_'_t received my parcel some how .
neutral	to be honest i don_'_t think the royal_mail price increase for small items has helped the matter .
neutral	there '_s standard , next_day , next_day by 00pm and next_day by 00 .
negative	i ordered bedroom_furniture on 00th of july , by 00th of august i had not received any correspondance apart_from an_email_confirming my payment .
neutral	collection was booked for after 0pm thurs yesterday , they arrived before that time a card was left .
positive	it was easily the best customer service i have received from a fancy_dress company .
neutral	i give you a full rating .
positive	i bought all my christmas_presents from them and received them all within 0_days of ordering .
negative	customer_services are not answering the phone .
neutral	worst , they ' re times one rep will tell you one thing while 0 other reps tell you 0 totally different things , leaving you not knowing which is correct .
negative	contact trustpilot ?
positive	the service we received was extremely responsive , informative , reassuring and helpful .
positive	will use again .
neutral	going out waited half hour , was not happy as they kept saying be there in 0 min why say that should of said be a while .
negative	buying something over the internet really should not be this much hassle and now i have thrown_away my money .

negative	called this morning to be told ' we can only apologise but we can_assure you that the delivery will happen this afternoon '.
positive	i order some flowers early evening and the we on my girlfriends door_step the next_morning .

negative	!
positive	the site we nicely_designed and easy to navigate within .
negative	unbelievable .
neutral	i was pleased with the speed of delivery but not so pleased when i was expected to help_unload it off the van , i '_ve got a very bad ankle and could hardly lift the crate .
neutral	you ' d have thought they ' d get it right by now , woudln '_t you ?
positive	i wont buy from anywhere_else ever again
negative	i am very angry , very tearful and bitterely dissapointed in their disinterest and complete disregard of customer_satisfaction once your money is taken .
neutral	have you even read what i '_ve written ?
neutral	by the time we got off the bus the replacement was full so we had to get on another bus .
positive	he_loves to listen to his country and western cd '_s and sometimes the radio but this portable machine also records and plays tapes .
negative	i '_ve seldom come_across such incompetence and definitely could not recommend them .
positive	once my receipient had received the flowers , however , she wondered_if she was qualified to look after them since they came with instructions to talk to them :)
positive	reasonable prices .
negative	i have never been a customer and they are trying to make me upgrade my phone with them .
negative	quality of the flowers was ok but they didn_'_t last long as they had clearly been sitting in the courier warehouse / van for too long .
positive	simples - if only half the companies out there were this helpful - life would be so much_easier !
positive	0 days after i had ordered them , they were being delivered to me .
negative	something that they are obliged according to european consumer_protection laws to do .
positive	product arrived on time and in perfect working order .
neutral	had to give notice in writing that i wanted to switch so thank good did this by email and got a confirmation .
negative	from reading the other reviews it looks like precious_little one is a company that , if everything goes well , can offer good value but buyer_beware if it doesn_'_t .
positive	delivery is super quick with e_- mails_telling you when your stuff will be delivered .
negative	received havainias slim 00 / 00
positive	ordered a edimax apn from them , which arrived promptly - though the courier delivered it quite late at around 0pm - kudo '_s to him for not turning around to head for home and leaving it for the next_day .
negative	!

positive	i was really pleased with my purchases !
neutral	so as i was also buying another tv , this custom will now go_elsewhere .
negative	they claim they are number 0 , well yes they are if you ignore the other 00 providers above them , what they mean is that they are no 0 of the big six companies with a customer_satisfaction score of just 00 %.
neutral	usautomotive use this system .
negative	other_reviewers are correct its rubbish .
negative	scottish_power are inefficient and the worst company i '_ve ever dealt_with .
positive	they sent me an evelope .
positive	- outstanding
neutral	hi workwear sales .
positive	would not_hesitate to buy from again !
neutral	i think someone had repackaged whilst having a quick cigarette !
neutral	i cannot quite see what would justify such a price hike as i thought they were already pricey .
negative	i have made it a point never to buy from them again .
neutral	animed have a repeat order facility which i thought would be a good idea as i always forget to reorder in time .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	she only turns 00 once and i ordered a lively bunch of flowers never to arrive .
positive	the key advantage of your company is the availability of next_day delivery without having to pay an additional tariff .
positive	delivery was reasonably_priced and arrived earlier_than_expected .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	i am a little disappointed that the ticket i purchased was double the original price .
positive	i need best value for the tyres i buy , but i also need clear and simple - to - understand guidance as to what '_s best for me in a competitive - and sometimes confusing - market .
negative	having to call three_times 0pm to find out where my delivery is only to be told repeatedly someone would call back , they didn_'_t .
negative	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
neutral	a friend recommended westin_gourmet to me and due to that i received a pack of free sausages .
positive	item was exactly as_described and to be honest in i was surprised that a used item was in such good condition , this makes me think that used items are picked to be of the highest_standard .
neutral	delivery time was between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
neutral	i ordered an a00 ankle_support as worn by andy_murray , for the right ankle size large , i received an a00 ankle_support for the left ankle size medium .

negative	ordered a £_00 bouquet which arrived virtually dead and the ' handwritten_note ' scrawled on a piece of cardboard , after emailing them i received a response asking for a photo .
negative	yeah till you see all the extras you get charged for !
neutral	other_websites do this so why whisky_exchange doesn_'_t is deterring me from coming_back to them more ofter .
positive	- good exchange_rates
neutral	needless to say they will not be my first choice of florist for future_purchases .
positive	they do not disappoint , and such great value for money !
neutral	printing on the packaging warns that if the packaging is damaged the unit cannot be returned , but i defy_anyone to remove the huge_amount of packing intact .
neutral	they have good prices but their customer_services could improve
negative	even if you pay for express .
negative	but tesco be warned if you decicde to change ostley cafe .
positive	easy , quick , good money - all_round win - win_situation !
neutral	my driving_licence was sufficient .
neutral	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come_back to you and they are never apologetic .
positive	it was all seamless , easy and i '_m very happy with the result .
neutral	with my most_recent order , i selected next_day delivery because i really needed it today , but it didn_'_t arrive .

negative	i can not get a refund , i can not find out when its likely to be dispatched and i can not do anything , not even speak to a manager .
positive	i recently_bought a bosch gks 00 ce circular_saw from ffx , their service was great the saw arrived the next_day well_packaged and the price was the cheapest on the net by a mile .
positive	i '_ve_used juno a couple of times and each time the record i have bought arrived quickly and was packaged well .
positive	all ok good good good good
negative	i started to panic now - so i phoned e . bookers to get a full_refund - but they told me i would not get fully refunded even_though it was only yesterday that i had booked - i was really annoyed because at no point during the booking did it prompt me about the luggage situation - i honestly feel that i have been conned - i have not cancelled because i am not losing any money - so the only option was to go on ba website and pay for luggage !
neutral	in the end , i gave up , and phoned again , and cancelled order , and then ordered elsewhere .
negative	you are not in contact as you say in your statement .
neutral	at first we were told we would sail on time ( 00th_june ) then further inquires at a later date we were told another week_later .
negative	this is a follow_up from a previous review relating to being_able to return a faulty item of clothing .
neutral	whilst i understand these things_happen , the customer shouldnt lose out .
positive	so next xmas you will probably get perfume !
positive	went on website to compare car_hire in the states , wanted to book before getting there .
negative	utter shit .
negative	not happy .
neutral	apart_from that no other gripes !
neutral	also they have a discount policy which is very confusing and i have been " cheated " out of a discount_code on one occasion which i was not happy about .
negative	i sent my mobile all intact then was told it arrived with one button missing .
positive	i '_ll be back for some more very soon .
positive	instructions were spot_on .
neutral	the clothes section is very disappointing .
positive	hopefully they will_continue to improve .
positive	very pleased .
neutral	i ordered a note book with photos on and the photos were upside_down .
positive	they were inexpensive ; perfect for what i needed and they arrived within 00_hours !
negative	the girl i spoke to implied that it had been damaged upon fitting .
neutral	what did surprise was that the shoes , worth £_000 , were left on the front_doorstep following a knock on the door .
negative	i tried my 00 year_old_son '_s costume on him and noticed it was ripped around the arm and it had a stain on the back . i sent it back for a refund and had an_email back stating that i had done the damage so i would not get a refund . i was appalled that i was accused of doing the damage and that i was not telling them the truth . i have neither a costume or refund now . i will never order from this site again .
neutral	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn_'_t type the special character in the middle of my name .
negative	i lost my money !
positive	i can look at different companies and websites and compare them objectively .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	very poor customer has_been given by fitting_centre .
negative	this is a company that is not prepared to offer any customer service .
negative	i have contacted them about it and have requested for the order to be resent .
positive	could not have got the items quicker and easier if had bought in store .
neutral	your web_site is easy to use , got my product in a reasonable amount of time .
neutral	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
negative	please mail back and tellme where my udon noodle order is i have been waiting now since the 0 september .

negative	i was waiting the whole day to hear any news from my friend but suddenly received an email which said :
neutral	delivery was perfect .
neutral	resultant photos acceptable , could be better .
neutral	a huge price to go with them .
neutral	however , play did refund me and communication was good , albeit quite a wait to have to process a refund .
negative	we are in excess of £_000 out of pocket and , as the phone is now permanently engaged , we can '_t speak to anyone to get our money back .
positive	what a stunning guitar it is , too !
neutral	sort it out hungryhouse !

negative	secondly i returned my item , 0_months later i still_haven_'_t received a refund .
negative	with no product and no contact to tell me what was happening i ended_up called them three_times .
negative	tried_calling the contact # and it won_'_t go through from the us .
positive	would recommend to anyone !
positive	from the selection of packages we chose the one for us .
negative	think i have had a lucky_escape .
negative	i chose chemist_direct over boots , who never have everything i need online .
neutral	they did not respond and only when i chased them later in the week and asked what was happening did i get an_automated despatched order e_- mail .
negative	they say that you can tell the worth of a company by how they treat you when things go_wrong .
negative	they said they had the exact item and in mint_condition .
positive	money you withdraw is back in bank_account quickly compared to other_sites .
neutral	i am being asked to rate the company when i have only just ordered the product .
neutral	no - one contacted me to say there was a problem with delivery and it would be delivered the next_day .
negative	when i did get a reply , i was told that the item was definitely due into stock and would be dispatched within 0 days .
positive	i ordered the item at 00pm on tuesday , they phoned me wednesday to confirm the postcode and it had been delivered by thursday , this is incredible given that it came from hong_kong .
positive	what you are looking for is simple to find .
positive	thank_you very much .
neutral	if the girl who answered my call worked for me , she wouldn_'_t work for long .
neutral	the search made it easy to find what i wanted straight_away .
negative	don_'_t buy from these , needed to cancel order , tried to charge me 00_% of total order to cancel it - how they still exist is beyond me .
neutral	courier a problem , advice said city_link who '_s website did not recognise the courier number .
neutral	i agreed to the repair but after waiting a considerable number of weeks as the manufacturer was busy i became fed_up of waiting and asked for a refund .
negative	i emailed , faxed and phoned but no response other than you can '_t cancel the contract .
neutral	apart_from the 0 year_warranty there is not real difference than buying on ebay .
positive	total time between our trusty 00 year hotpoint finally giving up the ghost to new ultima washing our family '_s clothes was about 00_hours .
negative	i sent two emails but received no reply .
positive	i cant_wait to get them in my bedroom .
positive	have no_hesitation in recommending animed_direct .
negative	0 .
positive	there is such a great range of products to choose from and the goods are delivered within days , would recommend the inkstation for any ink products .
positive	quick and easy .
negative	in any case , you could argue me plowing through crowds of pedestrians would save time driving through town it doesn_'_t make it the right way to do it .
positive	i just hope i do it justice when i wear it to my first ball :)
neutral	some games are worth leaving your lover for as well
neutral	my grandaughter has not received the goods yet
negative	i replied with “ thank_you but i do have to get taken to the hospital soon and my phone number ”

positive	i ordered yumove for my dog at 00 . 00pm on thursday_night and it arrived by royal_mail post 0 . 00am saturday_morning .
negative	of a long road , on a pallet truck it is now sat in there .
negative	it was bin collection day and only because by_chance we noticed the bin had been moved slightly we got to it before the bin men emptied it !
negative	father , and i suggest others , significant distress .
neutral	the outer leaves are completely folded in half and the outer flowers have lost a most of their petals .
negative	the supposed teflon coating that i was promised when i paid £_000 extra is non_existent .
neutral	i was told i should have brought a utility_bill but i was never told that when i booked .
positive	i cannot recommend them highly_enough and it is so refreshing to actually find a company that does exactly_what it says it '_s going to do with no_fuss , many many people and companies could_learn so much from these_guys .
negative	well maybe not so cheap if you don_'_t actually get any shoes after_spending over_£_00 .
positive	the only issue i have with the case is i use an aux cable regularly in my car to play music through the stereo and you have to push the cable quite firm to fit past the silicone casing .
positive	excellent service , fast and informative
positive	why didn_'_t i think of this before ?
negative	would not use again or recommend to anyone_else .
positive	i confess i remained somewhat wary about opting for this route , but as i intended to fund the investment by disposing of some shares , i concluded that the risks involved were no greater than investing in the stock market .
neutral	the uncertainty of whether the goods will arrive doesn_'_t always justify the financial saving .
neutral	i even offered to buy the correct_size , and when it arrived send incorrect 0 back then receive refund , but no , £_00 to return
neutral	the search_engine is limited as i have to specify what time i wish to travel , when i should just be able to put in the following
neutral	disappointed , i also emailed them and asked for a return under dsr - which they ignored .
neutral	they need to catch up with the customer service improvements of modern companies .
positive	we presume the others were still out of stock and they did not want to make us wait any longer .
neutral	i wanted to complain at the time but my recent conversations with the receptionist made me think that there would be no point .
positive	i shopped_around and found feel good contact_lenses to not only be the cheapest in terms or product but also offer free delivery on most orders .
neutral	they have some nice stuff because i '_ve bought a jumper there that looked lovely and also a pair of shorts aswell as basics but even these i could buy cheaper elsewhere at the same quality .
positive	they arrived quickly in the post and were well_packed .
positive	we haven_'_t printed out our holiday snaps for 0 years so my husband will be dead chuffed to get this year '_s as a christmas_pressie in an a0 album !
negative	i couldnt get through to any one to inform them i am fustrated and want to leave vodafone totally .

negative	awful .
negative	!
negative	i won_'_t be buying anything_else from homebase that needs delivering !
negative	wait for it : delivery dates to the highlands of scotland cannot be guaranteed !
negative	i would never use them again !
neutral	it '_s a shame that the delivery driver ruining what otherwise would have been a pleasant ordering experience .
negative	the delivery of each order has let the whole_thing down - boxes left on doorsteps , behind the bin etc .
positive	the item was quickly dispatched and reached me very quickly , it actually arrived sooner_than i expected it to .
neutral	i regularly buy from chaos_cards and if it had been a month_ago this review would have been 0_stars , however the website is updating and the changes might be minor but they are critical .
negative	so i called tuesday to be advised “ the lady in despatch wasn_’_t in yesterday ” one lady ?!
negative	this has_been a long_drawn_out process , however it looks like i will finally get a resolution , and i am finally happy with the outcome .
negative	obviously this says more about royal_mail than healthy_supplies & if they can ensure i receive the items i ordered in the next couple of days i will happily change my review to reflect their assistance but for now i remain an unhappy customer .
positive	the company are innovative and still maintain great value for money even explaining vat_exemption .
positive	i received an_email promptly the next_day to say the correct keys had been posted .
positive	very impressed .
neutral	however , the instructions to assemble the wardrobe were very , very poor .
neutral	what a waste of millions of peoples time - surely the postcode does this .
negative	to date ( nearly one week_later ) and after 0 emails and reports to myprotein no response has_been provided except an auto response from customer_services acknowledging_receipt of my complaint .
negative	again i spent_ages on hold .
neutral	the ordering_process was quick and efficient .
positive	came home and found selectspecs online , found a similar pair of frames to the ones i ' d tried in the high_st optician , specified the exact_same lenses as before amazing a third of the price !
negative	in the meantime countless_emails , messages left and not replied to , delivery dates given but not adhered to , on one historic date pre and after sales sent 0 conflicting delivery dates - of course it did not arrive on either date .
neutral	i '_ve said it in one_sentence
positive	slide on hinge - 000 ° opening - full overlay .
neutral	i feel as if we regular_users are being milked .
negative	avoid at all costs !
neutral	not good !
negative	further_action is most definitely needed !!!!
positive	always a bit of a worry when using a company for the first time for an article that is not on the cheap side .
neutral	the booking was non_refundable .
neutral	our party were in the bar and purchased a lot of alcohol while i had my water .
negative	i will mark it 0 - 0 .
neutral	bit_miffed at having to pay postage , so decided that as i was going to have to pay for this i might as well increase my order and make good use of it .
neutral	a bit misleading so i stated the delivery information should reflect this as some companies still operate on bank_holidays .
neutral	regards per tore boe
neutral	so why do you insist on listing departure times from both french ports , calais and dunkerque , on the same page , when you have already chosen the port of departure ?
positive	when i got to the service station the young_chap had noticed the wheel i had just bought was the wrong_size for my car he told not to worry_about having the tyre fitted and advised me of the size i required .
negative	ordered 0 sets of dumbells , 0 arrived on friday , called to find out where the 0rd was and was told would be delivered on monday .
neutral	unfortunately the handbrake stuck on during our hire , which was not the fault of the hire company - these things just happen .
negative	at the minute i am unable to view any wowcher deals at all from my i pad . not sure why this is but when i try to click onto anything the screen just flashes and can '_t open .
positive	my wife bought me a white_tie jacket and trousers by " black n white ", wing_collar marcella front dress_shirt , white_tie marcella waistcoat and a self_tie marcella bow_tie .
negative	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
positive	order placed , good comms throughout and fast free delivery
positive	my order was placed promptly and accurately , delivery was quick and as scheduled and the product ( outdoor_table_tennis_table ) is superb - very impressed all_round .
positive	very fast delivery .
neutral	i recycled all the cardboard but not able to recycle the polystyrene .
positive	will_definitely use again .
positive	i posted off my phone & 0days_later , true to form my argos_voucher had arrived in the post !
neutral	the service was excellen , t i did however think that the bouquet would have been bigger
negative	i felt this was quite rude .
positive	oh_yes , there were cheaper_than anyone_else by far !
negative	not a good experience but a real damper on our holiday from day one .
positive	updates on order and delivery process were also much_appreciated .
positive	regular e_mails which informed me of each_step of process .
positive	the product has only been used once so far and all is ok .
positive	i recommend cheapsmells to everyone who_asks where they can buy .
neutral	i got the vehicle i asked for ( ford_fiesta ) and i paid the price i was originally_quoted but the vehicle had seen better days .
neutral	returning home i went on the web and found the same tyre , fitted at the same location that i had just returned from available £_00 : 00 cheaper .
neutral	unfortunately none of these were included .
neutral	i discovered it cheaper to become a new client with storagemart after 0 years .
neutral	this was unnecessary and totally_spoilt any surprise .
positive	i want to thank the tour representative that was outside on the sidewalk waiting for people .
neutral	i have two small pkts of 0 tablet .
neutral	unfortunately the cork in the port was completely dried out and crumbled on opening , " poor cellar or slow seller " .
negative	i regret this now !!
negative	after_spending almost £_000 over the past 0_months i '_m moving onto a different supplier !
positive	apparently , normally it '_s possible to specify approximate delivery time ?
positive	spot on !
neutral	luckily the hotel staff were very helpful and we were transferred to a much_nicer , larger hotel for free .
neutral	both_times the packing has_been completely inadequate .
positive	they are so fast , and packed so beautifully in cardboard tubes for posting .
neutral	the price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone .
negative	i sent one through their system which says you will receive a reply within an_hour , and when several hours_later that had not been forthcoming , i emailed them again .
neutral	but although we had paid for the full insurance coverage there was an additional 000 rand ' assessment fee ' payable which was pointed_out to me in the small_print when i questioned the charge .
neutral	this was a great little feature and stood you out from the rest in a very competitive market !
positive	i ordered the television on boxing_day , and had no less_than 0 phone_calls between then and delivery ( on the 00th_december ) to confirm the order and delivery timeframe .
neutral	so i then contacted megafancydress for their returns address and they told me the item had to be returned to argos !
positive	the guides with private_kilimanjaro were with us every_step of the way and supported us physically and mentally .
negative	that was a week_ago and i '_ve heard_nothing from them .
negative	but that '_s fine if they think that , so i rejected the offer to get the phone returned to me .
positive	i bought the iron from go - electrical for £_00 and delivery was free .
positive	excellent serviice and excellent value !
neutral	prewrapped cheese is a rip - off compared to the cheeses counter .
positive	many_thanks .
neutral	order was placed and i received an_email a few_days_later to say item was being delivered on a certain day .
positive	would recommend this site to anyone .
negative	i '_m_sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
neutral	so a little dissapointed but not essentially a fault of serenata .
negative	my husband told him that they either had a floor here tomorrow , next_day delivery ( which they offer , incidentally , don_'_t take them up on it , because their £_00 . 00 standard delivery doesn_'_t do what it says on the tin !
positive	good variety to chose from and a hassle_free order .
positive	i was kept_informed of the whole_process from the time of ordering to the time they got despatched and delivered .
positive	i use to buy my cat_food now he has a sensitive_stomach .
negative	the reasons behind why they couldn_'_t change the address didn_'_t make_sense as i asked them to change the address on the same day i ordered the flowers !
neutral	), they become a victim of their own success and have been criticised in a number of areas in the past , most recently for publishing ages of actors without their consent .
neutral	i have had only good experiences with holiday_autos , up to the time when i found that they had signed me up with goldcar .
positive	great service will repeat
positive	product was best price here and arrived within a few_days of order .
negative	i wonder_why it '_s so low ( 0000 miles or 0 month )?
neutral	i did this and cancelled the paypal automatic payment as well .
negative	they even lied and said they ' d been to the address and that the item had been collected !!!
neutral	payout speed varies considerably from one merchant to another .
neutral	turned_out the box used was too small and the product was put in ( in its own box ) without anything to protect it ( bubble_wrap etc_.)
negative	thriteen days_later i rang and emailed them , was told the item was not available !
negative	my sister has had a recent_bereavement and i wanted to send her some flowers as a little surprise to help cheer_her up .
neutral	hello
positive	i '_ve been looking for a weird fish macaroni after a friend of mine said what a good bit of gear it was .
negative	i rather pay a little more to bt and have zero hassle than pay minimal for something that is clearly a shambles !
negative	[_name removed_],
neutral	the brass flap i have received from them is excellent quality but not exactly as their spokesperson described .
neutral	i ordered a camping kitchen and needed it quite urgently so i requested express delivery and paid £ 0 . 00 .
negative	listen to as many other news sources that you can and try to redress the totally biased bbc output form your own ideas !.
negative	conclusion_: this is so bad on so many levels - just don_'_t go there .
positive	excellent compact .
positive	also seem reasonably_priced ( though that '_s not my primary_reason for choosing them )
neutral	i have not had the chance of inspecting my purchase yet . despatched on the 0nd still_waiting on the 00th
positive	i have not used the car_hire option so can '_t speak for that .
positive	it has certainly helped my dogs itching - thank_you !
negative	we still don_'_t have broadband and are waiting to hear how we will be compensated .
negative	this company knows exactly_what they ' re doing , and if this is what they do to earn_money and pay their shareholders then the future is not very bright for them .
neutral	after e_- mailing customer_services they re - printed the cards , but they then came cropped to one of the other sides - still not quite what was shown on the preview .
neutral	however , the failure to receive the product in time and confirmation_email of order , whilst the money had been taken from account , was disappointing .
negative	my old option is to go to the store and have it out with them .
positive	i then came_across cash in your gadgets who offered me over_£_00 . 00 , at first i thought this was too good to be true , especially as there was a problem with my laptop '_s fan which i couldn_'_t describe on the questionnaire , but i went with it anyway , knowing i could get my laptop returned for free if_necessary .
neutral	on the thursday i got two calls , one from a lady confirming friday_morning , then a second from a man saying they could not make the appointment , i would have to wait_until monday .
negative	after_reading all the great reviews about menapol_plus i was hoping for great things !!!
negative	fyi holidaysautos is a front for cartrawler . com , check their reviews for the real rating .
positive	zero_hassle .
neutral	most of all your queues after 00pm with only one check - out operator working ( edinburgh jewel )
positive	there has to be a catch - but there isn_'_t .
negative	die erste habe_ich nach 0 wochen bekommen , eine ist nicht mehr auf lager obwohl sie im onlineshop als vorrätig aufgelistet war und_die anderen zwei sind nicht mehr auf lager und werden irgendwann geschickt .
positive	well_done scorpion will definitely use again .
negative	what they are doing with their arbitary acceptance process , and non return of goods amounts to thef .
neutral	ordered from fine_coffee_club for my new krups coffee_machine which recommends nespresso_capsules which unfortunately are very expensive .
negative	thought i ' d switch from [_external_reference_] to sainsbury ( beaconsfield ).
negative	i have selected several " good reviewers " asking if they wrote their review , i '_ll let you all know what the responses are .
positive	many_thanks animed

positive	the phone case i ordered came faster_than_expected and the photo is excellent quality !
neutral	product took ~ 00days to arrive , had to phone up to find out where order was .
negative	do not use this company ever

negative	! to take it to the shop and now i '_ve got to pick it !
negative	i was very disappointed , flowers broken , flowers were brown edged and the box they arrived in were saturated with water .
positive	the on - line shipping cost is simple to understand and is extremely competitive .
positive	the website was easy to follow and offered a variety of choice .
positive	ordered a fridge_freezer and cooker_hood on friday_night at 00 0 clock and was all in my kitchen by tea time sunday .
neutral	when the new 0s stops working the customer service refer you to an o0 shop - who will have nothing to do with you .
negative	heard_nothing so assumed order was okay .
negative	after giving a basic valuation they then take £_00 off that as an administrator fee as a starting_point .
positive	impressive !
positive	although getting the finance on my bike took longer_than_expected ( outside pedalon '_s control ) at every_stage they reacted within the hour to my emails and when the bike arrived the courier took till 0 . 00 on the day to deliver , but pedalon staff were great on the phone checking and chasing and called me back at 0 . 00pm to make_sure it was all good . which it was .
negative	i said there '_s nothing i can do then is there ?. no he said !
neutral	also material very scratchy !!
negative	i booked some tickets to see pat metheny at the hammersmith apollo in june .

neutral	had some issues with this store .
neutral	when i think back , the same has happened before with laswson his .
negative	it is now the evening of 00 / 00 / 00 and i have still not received the item .
negative	unfortunately , even these panels did not produce their full output as specified , but more_importantly the construction was such that when water entered one of the so - called sealed panels it shorted its internal electronics , which in turn shorted the battery bank of three batteries it was charging , completely destroying their charging capability .
negative	00 days_later - not delivered , despite 0 email and 0 telephone_calls from me .
positive	was told that there was no way that my iphone could be unlocked by a certain telecoms company ; looked at this site and was suspicious although site looks professional and theres a phone number with contact address .

neutral	this raises two points .
positive	fingers_crossed , the carpet moths have been banished forever , but the sticky traps will help me to monitor the situation on a regular_basis .
positive	half the price of the local_florists .
positive	i initially placed my order with toolstop as they were significantly_cheaper_than anywhere_else on the web .
neutral	great ordering service , great price but yodel are a useless carrier , online tracking first delivery they need not attempt delivery , i had addressed the delivery to my work address and useless yodel say no delivery to a business address beyond 0 :_00pm they say they attempted the second delivery at 0 :_00pm !!!!
positive	quick , easy , great designs , what more do you want !
neutral	the experience was fine but the only down_side is that there was no paper recipt sent with my boots , other than that it was fine . have emailed them twice for a printed recipt to be sent out by post but nothing yet , so the jury is still out .

positive	great price , speedy delivery .
negative	at the time it took .
positive	from sending off my order to receiving the finished_product , was only a few_days , and the finished book was even better_than i had hoped , very professional .
neutral	the service from diamonds_factory has_been excellent .
neutral	i requested a status update on day 0 , via my google_checkout account , and received an email ( likely a generic , copy n paste type response ) within an_hour from one of the customer_services executives .
neutral	also their returns_policy is a bit_strange , you have to pay to have them pick_up the returned item even if the item is small enough to bring it back to the shop yourself .
negative	having ordered a coat on the 00th_march the payment has_been taken
positive	would def recommend spectrum .

neutral	therefore the whole_process took too long .
negative	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt_bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !

neutral	jacket & trousers were just like in the photo but the hat was a completely_different item from the photo as well as the shirt & tie not being of the same quality as in the photo .

neutral	now the whole point of paying a premium_rate to park right at the terminal is to allow a fast getaway when returning late from a business trip .
negative	i will have to pay the price the person would pay who just happened to walk in possibly an illegal immigrant with no checkable personal history or credit_rating or anything people could call background .
positive	many thank eflorist .

neutral	still_waiting on the items 00 days after ordering , after being charged £ 0 for delivery .
neutral	then the driver asked to be dropped_off to the train_station which would have been a 00 mile_round_trip .
negative	he merely delivered it , it wasn_'_t his company providing it .
negative	oh_yes , and what '_s more , i shall be pursuing the cost of that 00 minute phone_call when i get my phone bill - i was blatantly kept on the line ( as i see other_reviewers have mentioned too )

positive	good quality products .
positive	had to call because i made a mistake when ordering was rectified_immediately .
negative	is a great way to air ones grievances !
neutral	product well made and value for money except that one of the extension flaps did not quite fit and needed some manoeuvring to get it to fit .
neutral	i assumed for that price of £_00 ( incl delivery ) the lid for the drawer was included .
negative	purchased samsung_s0 from them in july - the package was sent to the wrong_address and it was picked_up by the resident of that address .
negative	after several emails back and forward i am still none the wiser , they say that the delivery company will contact me but still nothing , i have asked them to confirm what details they have given the delivery company to make_sure they have the correct phone number but still nothing .

neutral	did raise concerns but not as helpful as in previous years .
negative	your honest_opinion makes a difference .
neutral	most unsatisfactory .
neutral	we bought two items from pro_cook , one was a set of knives and a knife rack which was fine , a good price and a decent set of knives .
neutral	sadly , it then took 0 months , and another 0 sets of requests - the responses to each of which informed that the accounts_dept .
positive	very pleased with quick delivery , and lights are good quality as well . bought some previously on e_- bay from china and they were a death trap 000volt and loose wires .
negative	i pay 00 months line rental saver and i received my bill today and they have now charged me again for my line rental , so to date i have been charged_twice for my line rental !

neutral	rather save_money for the same product .
positive	very easy system to navigate and money credited to my account withing 0_days of posting my phone to them .
negative	it wasn_'_t until later i found out that they are the same company as mns automation solutions .
negative	despite my repeated telephone_calls and emails , china_chaps remained resolute that the problem was with dartington_glass .
negative	they ignored paypal too , so ( eventually ) i got the refund under paypal '_s default system .
negative	two_weeks down the line still no goods .
positive	well_packed , good dvd and instruction_manual , easy to set_up and a dream to use .
positive	the black pins / studs were a little difficult to fit to some of the chairs as the pin kept bending but this was over come by drillling a slightly_bigger hole .
negative	i still have not received an_email asking for my bank details , and the money has not been transferred .
negative	despite several e_- mails beforehand , when i placed my order on - line i did not recieve goods .
negative	not a good experience at all . the worst company ever !
negative	ordered 0 bracelets online and was told they would be available to pick them up today at my local waitrose store ' after 0 pm '.

positive	flowers beautiful and delivered when quoted .
negative	something should be done about them .
neutral	i then had to rush around to get some change to find where to pay for the parking to moving the car to another car_park which made me late booking in for my flight .
neutral	now i '_m not laying the fault for smashed tiles at the feet of walls and floors , as it may well have been the courier launching the boxes into the back of the van .
negative	?
positive	great website , instant communication and fast delivery ; what more could you want ?
positive	website is easy to use .
neutral	i doubt i will be ordering from a animed again , as i could not track my parcel !

positive	and as superheroes weren_'_t allowed this year , i decided to go with a classic .
neutral	needless to say i ended_up doing all the driving .
positive	great prices and super_fast delivery .
negative	now i had it , i will now give sainsbury a chance and suggest everybody_else does the same .
neutral	i was happy with the product i purchased but delivery was very slow .
positive	i also take_advantage of the special_offers and deals , and with such a wide_range of products i '_m spoilt for choice and easily reach the 00 pounds minimum to qualify for free delivery .
negative	it does not seem like an illegitimate company i dont_know how they havent been shut_down yet .
negative	i ordered a pack , and i payed for it , but i have not got it yet .
positive	five_star service , brilliant .

neutral	anyway , i ended_up with the right parts to build a windowless shed with a load of superfluous perspex windows .
positive	which is a bonus for most people ( unlike tesco !)
negative	i was going to email and ask for a refund to be honest if they didn_'_t arrive within the next couple of days
negative	i was worried , they had £_00 of my money .
negative	order from them if you want a totally random bunch of flowers !
negative	followed there instructions on how to unlock my iphone and what a shock it meant i had to take it to apple for a replacement .
negative	delivery via yodel probably the poorest i have ever_experienced , still not arrived after a week and the party is in 0_weeks !
negative	better_than others iv visited for the items i needed .
negative	it was in perfect working order before i brought it to them and , 0 hours in , i am still applying updates and attempting to identify a networking issue that hasn_'_t ever troubled me before .
negative	i recently_purchased an iphone off ebay and the seller chose to ship using collect_+.
negative	the live_chat kept cutting me off telling they had been been received even_though i told them twice they hadn_'_t .
neutral	which is more convenient .
neutral	i accept this , but would have been useful to have that made clear on the website when purchasing .
positive	i was looking for specifically glucosamine which is from natural vegetarian source , i found that it is synthetically prepared as well as from shell fish .
positive	can '_t beat that for speedy service !
negative	still no phone after waiting a further 0 days so contacted again to ask when i would get the phone .
neutral	the prices are competative , however the site is not the easiest to use .
positive	what can i say , music_matter were fabulous and lee was terrific .
neutral	:(
negative	i '_ve had no reply despite_repeated mails to them and making a formal_complaint .
positive	great purchase .
neutral	but your on - line ordering implies ex - stock delivery .
negative	should sort_out there voucher situation !
neutral	so beware , it may not be as cheap as you think !
neutral	in addition , it was ironically ‘ fortunate ’ that my package_containing 0 legal knives was not collected by fedex .
negative	we made an impulse purchase at dixons manchester_airport on 00 march_0000 of a panasonic waterproof dvd camera , specifically to capture our day at discovery_cove but also useful for the rest of our holiday too - or so we thought .
neutral	when price is more important than luxury .
negative	i wasn_'_t happy .
positive	been using this company for years and never had a bad_experience .
neutral	further surprised to have a amount reduced a tenth once it had been received .
negative	!
neutral	great kit available on golfonline , easy ordering and quick dispatch .
neutral	goods expected to be signed for whilst items still in boxes - so unable to check condition .
negative	what was not fine was that they charged my card before putting the order on hold , and then did not inform_me that the order was on hold .
positive	web_site was easy to follow and chips came when they said they would
positive	i have also ' invested ' in some of their ultimate 0000 thread_count bed_linen - yes , a bit_pricey , compared to other options - but absolutely worth the outlay for such fine quality cotton .
positive	packing excellent , all in zip bags .
negative	they ' re usually quite efficient in getting stuff to you ( though i did have some christmas orders turn_up well into th new year ) and competitively_priced .
positive	beautiful .
negative	we pride ourselves on our clear communication so don_'_t worry if you get plenty of emails from us letting you know how your order is coming along ”
negative	i then spent the rest of the week trying to contact the company via_email and phone to find out what had happened to the flowers and to arrange a refund .
negative	the villa furthermore was very dirty , the beds were very short ( 0 ' 0 ") and as our boys were 0 ' 0 " and 0 ' 0 " respectively were unfit for purpose .
negative	not good - resent using royal_mail .
negative	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem . which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .
positive	many_thanks .
neutral	that just isn_'_t good enough .
neutral	asking advice of a nutritionist i found i knew more than she did on a supplement .
negative	what was delivered was very poor substitute - cheap flowers and wrapping .
negative	if this goes on much longer then we should all take legal_action and retrieve the money through our credit_cards .
neutral	having paid_extra for guaranteed delivery on monday i was surprised when it didnt appear .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending them .
neutral	but anything i can quote is just my opinion - just my disappointment .

negative	in the end i contacted amazon , explained the problem and with the help of amazon '_s customer_support staff have arranged for another carrier to pick it up in a few_days time hopefully with more luck this time .
negative	i arrived early so definitely did not miss it .
neutral	i think that when you register a company with your website it states that all company '_s will be registered in 0 hours , however we have registered over 0 companies with you and we have waited a lot longer_than 0 hours .
negative	this company took my money , but never sent my order .
negative	i had purchased my blackberry from the store , my blackberry had a manufacturing_fault so this had to be taken in for ' servicing ', they advised me that this would be back to me in 0_weeks .
neutral	where the price and meals offered are the same for all three then i
negative	no way to run a business
neutral	i didn_'_t challenge when it was received , although i note it was a number of days prior to the request i had to make any comments .
neutral	well , it took about 0 or 0 months for me to get it sorted and for me to get in touch with a nice lady in disconnections who understood my frustration and who not only fixed my bill but also ensured i '_m receiving a £ 0 loyalty_discount for the next 00 months .
negative	i received a quick reply , which was a nice_surprise for a sunday_evening , but i was told that as stated in the small_print on the website , there was no guarantee that my flowers would be delivered on the sunday , but that they could take an extra working day .

positive	i have often had problems trying to send flowers from the us to the uk .
positive	mark .
positive	very good product had a prob with locking pin rang up one arrived next_day .
negative	i am not going to write reams here as i have already done that in a complaint to this company on the 00th_feb which apart_from a standard email back they have not had the decency to repsond to , even their own status on the complaint has changed to critical without response so it shows you what they care about their customers satisfaction .
negative	the least they could have done would be to use next - day shipping for an order that was placed over a month_ago , but they did not .
positive	they were great - i couldn_'_t be in to receive my order and arranged for it to be left in a safe location at the last_minute . very helpful and efficient . would recommend .

negative	i wont_be using them again , id rather pay extra money and know my complaints , if any , will be dealt quickly and efficiently .
neutral	was also impressed with the tracking_information and delivery .
positive	they have a power that belies their size and the trigger activated led '_s are really handy in those dark recesses .
negative	i also emailed hotelsclick asking someone to call me , i have not received a reply nor a phone_call .
neutral	my issue with company has_been resolved but would recommend times on iphone_app after noon read 00 , 00 , 00 etc not 0 pm 0 pm also could have been a lot_easier to resolve this at initial point of contact not by me leaving negative_review

negative	i spent the first hour of the weekend_break trying to get through to expedia but spent most of it on hold .
negative	talking to [_name_removed_] is a joke as she knows nothing .
neutral	she was delighted but i am disappointed with the way in which they were delivered .
negative	also , the " free treatment " states on the front it is for decorative purposes .
negative	it then it took 0 days for the refund to arrive .
negative	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
positive	ordered some turtle food - was here by the next_day - thank u will shop again with u x
neutral	i was expecting a better quality item , better packaging etc .
negative	ordered online expecting the product to arrive in 0 - 0 days .
positive	firstly , it should be known that to complete this review , worktop_express are offering a chopping_board to customers who submit a positive_review .
negative	the buds are discoloured and already brown and worsening .
negative	worst customer service ever_experienced !
neutral	i was very shocked as this was said in front of myself and my 00 year_old_son , all i could say in return was , “ how rude ”.
negative	delivered this morning for my daughter '_s 0th birthday , they were supposed to be a small treat just to make her smile and feel loved .
neutral	no knock on the door and no note left through the door , so i waited in all day for nothing .
neutral	a shame reall because the rest of the service and delivery was good
positive	excellent service and value for money .
positive	saves a fortune on chemist prices
positive	great service 00 out of 00 .
positive	as requested , the flowers were delivered the next_day .
positive	i bought weights for the integrated pockets at the same time and the overall delivery charge was minimal .
positive	great service .
neutral	good park and ride facility , except neither the bar_code scanner or payment card worked to enter or exit the car_park , meaning i had to press the help button to gain_entry .
positive	good range of clothes , quick delivery and hasstle_free returns .
negative	i felt that he was annoyed by the lateness of my order but he knew nothing about my personal_circumstances nor why i was ordering so late ( my baby son had been in hospital for 0 nights and was only just home ).
negative	i took out a telephone , broadband and tv contract .
positive	overall i cannot_fault the prompt friendly and affordable service i received .
negative	ps .
negative	what a joke .
neutral	reading through the car_rental voucher , it appears that the car_seat has not been included and is available as an extra .
negative	the websire is now down for 0 days ?
negative	our_household have since changed to a similar small uk isp and could not be_happier with the quality of service we ’ ve received .
neutral	i had bought the 00 luxury red_roses for my girlfriend on valentines_day , but when they arrived luxury is not one off the many words i would use describe them
negative	however in an email from a different yodel employee i was told the latest for collections was 0pm so as far as operating times is concerned with this lot it '_s anyone '_s guess .
negative	the girl i spoke to was rude and unhelpful .
negative	if i tried signing in the normal way , it didn_'_t recognise me - even when i requested a password reminder !
negative	not happy .
neutral	the service was fine & delivered in good time however . the flowers were sparse didn_'_t even fill a vase .
negative	problems with one pair could be considered unlucky .
neutral	your foot overhangs either_side of the shoe base .
neutral	i ordered lenses and paid_extra for express delivery by 0pm next_day as i was going on holiday .
neutral	twice in one night we found ourselves complaining and this totally_spoilt the occasion of my husbands_birthday which we had spent along time planning and looking_forward to .
negative	i ordered a bouquet for a friend '_s birthday which was supposed to consist of white_roses and purple freesias and paid_extra to include a further 00 %.
neutral	but sad to say they only lasted a few_days as they started dying , which was a bit_disappointing .
negative	someone tricked me , and certainly not command you to other customers !
negative	) something to do with an ' automated manager ' that took over until the connection .
neutral	he knocked at the door , didn_'_t wait and just left the flowers on the door_step .
positive	the tracking service was easy and the guy on the phone was brilliant , very chirpy and helpful .
positive	good service in keeping_me in touch on how the delivery was going .
negative	when i email them , i get a standard email answer , totally missing the point .
positive	bought a tall , medium and it fits_perfectly .
negative	this is devious , and i won_'_t use this company again .
negative	they discover some minor_damage to the contacts in the usb_port , which they seem to have fixed – hopefully it will stay fixed .
positive	very quick , efficient and would definitely use again .
neutral	i purchased the flowers for my wife '_s birthday with a discount_voucher so value for money was excellent but i didn_'_t receive an email on the day as i was supposed to , the flowers didn_'_t arrive until 0 . 00 so i waited in all day for nothing & the surprise for my wife was spoilt because by that time i ' d thought they weren_'_t going to arrive & had told her about them so i was left a little disappointed to say the least
neutral	i have had to chase them repeatedly to find out the current_status and reasons for delay , which was frustrating .
neutral	ordered dahlias and asters . you had no asters and you decided to supply a substitute , more dahlias . finished up with more dahlias than we required
positive	i have always wanted a proper tuxedo and now feel with your prices it is within my reach .
negative	i sent 0 parcels on the standard service to be delivered within the 0 - 0_days .
neutral	their underwear , men '_s socks etc still seem ok , but this is hardly enough to keep them going .
neutral	we were so desperate to get out of there , we didn_'_t query it .
neutral	the postal firms do not charge extra to deliver to where i live so i don_'_t understand_why i was charged extra .
negative	the good deals are countered by the rubbish service .
negative	firstly she said " we only found out this week the material isn_'_t in stock " - she was either too stupid to understand , or couldn_'_t be bothered to listen to me that they must have known at the end of december / 0st week in january that the material wasn_'_t in stock and therefore they weren_'_t going to make the delivery date but they didn_'_t even have the courtesy to let_me know .
positive	i always felt at ease , with proper professional advice on what would be the best treatment for me . the hospital in manchester has a comfortable waiting area , and my procedure was carried_out with the minimum of fuss . im very pleased with the outcome .
positive	000_% satisfied
negative	paypal state that the order needs to be processed by the company . when i enquired_about the order status as i was eager to receive the canvas , the email i received back was offensive in tone , by being very condescending , and assumed the error was the fault of my inability to use a very simplistic ordering process .
neutral	i received a call from rattan '_s head of logistics and he arranged for another courier and i received my sun_loungers on 0th_june .
positive	excellent service .
neutral	but my opinion has changed because over last 0_weeks i have not had any luck
positive	expensive but worth_every_penny .
neutral	i think this is a waste .
neutral	good quality blinds at the right price plus good service with delivery .
neutral	i shall await the call with interest , but i do feel that the ingredients should be listed on the product in the first place .
positive	having reviewed many options online and on the high_street i realised that the diamond_factory offered the best value rings .
neutral	i booked a flight through ebookers , unfortunately had to cancel within 00hr .
positive	i will certainly use your service again .
neutral	bit noisy and the dust tray is difficult to remove , the button release is too deep and have to mess_around a bit trying to push the release meaning dust does spill out .
negative	the automated service is far from helpful .
neutral	approx 00 day delivery a bit too long i felt , the product is fine although perhaps not as sturdy as the blind it replaced .
negative	they just don_'_t understand that " special_occasion " is on " a specific date "!
positive	!
negative	this was not a luxury item i needed the drill for work as i had my drill stolen the previous weekend .
positive	emails dealt_with promptly good website and excellent delivery .
neutral	since the hostel already is assured of the booking they will put you in the room in the back with no windows or net to the toilet and keep the room ( the nice one as advertised on the website ) for people that just walk in .
neutral	i have emailed them again today - wont hold my breath till they respond !
negative	but this time everything seemed to go_wrong .
positive	never used super drug online before was very easy to use would use again .
negative	later that evening we rang to find out what was going on , only to be told that nothing was happening because the engineer had reported that there was no access to the leak !
neutral	i have never had to wait for the car to be returned with other meet and greet services .
negative	you may end up with liability of custom fees and there goes your deal .
negative	tesco isnt like it used to be its lost its customer_sevices mind you im not sure it had any to start with , they must think there customers are stupid to fall for there so called price drop and there programmed to say im_sorry to hear that drives me nuts i come the end of the year my club card goes in the shredder and my nectar_card gets a boost
negative	they wanted us to send it back at our cost originally but i refused and said that as it was their fault , they should arrange a collection , which they did .
neutral	but almost every time i go on the website looking for stuff , it '_s out of stock !
negative	pay alittle extra - dont use uk sport import .
positive	very pleased .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	would not buy from them again .
positive	would certainly recommend without_hesitation , and would definatley use simplelighting again in the future .
negative	i rang them up to try and find out why we suddenly owed them over 00 pound more than originally , and got bounced between 0 very unprofessional , and down - right rude , members of staff ( including a " manager " who offered me £_00 compensation for the trouble ).
negative	( quindell motors 0 year contract with rac )
positive	each item was very well_wrapped and i was impressed with the quality of the furniture .
neutral	just one eye ( my left ) feels_like it might be too strong , and i end up getting a pain above that eye after wearing them for more than 00_minutes , which doesnt_happen with my older glasses !
positive	quality tyres , good grip , very good price , and i can really tell the difference since the 0 new tyres i have had fitted .
negative	i asked if they would give me one from their stock but that was not possible .
neutral	service was good .
neutral	ordering : 0 / 0
positive	and the website does the rest , it came back with the cheapest tyre by far compared to anywhere_else .
positive	i will_certainly use then again .
neutral	i buy a lot online so am used to website purchasing , but i am sorry , the prestige one is not clear enough .
negative	it turns_out this is not the case !
negative	some of the customer service advisors are rude and arrogant .
positive	i am booking up for my third holiday day very soon .
negative	just utter_rubbish
neutral	i wasn_'_t clear that my order had gone_through and as no money taken from account i had to call them .
negative	don_'_t use them .
neutral	the flowers , in a rather poor quality basket looked insignificant in their setting .
neutral	bought a great petzl head_torch , very happy with it .
negative	it has_been over two_weeks since they took payment , and they haven_'_t replied to emails or telephone_call ever .
positive	given that my new phone cost £_000 i am now in profit and someone_else will get to benefit from my old phone .
neutral	not surprised as it '_s made of delicate wood ( i ordered the slim frame type ), and considering it was a large print , the packaging was never going to ultimately protect it when shipping .
negative	sent a blackberry_0000 almost 0_weeks_ago . was told payment would be made today ( 00st_jan ) still no payment !
negative	i '_m only giving them 0_star on this site because you cannot post a review with no stars !
positive	thanks !
neutral	to conclude , i would use you again .
negative	!
negative	new customers get all the deals , existing_customers get shafted .
neutral	looked lovely out of the pack but when cooked ( to medium ) meat was pretty tough , not especially flavoursome and was full of grissle .
neutral	my animals have had to go without feed tonight and i am very , very unhappy !!!
positive	a wonderful trip ---- well_organised and thoroughly_enjoyable
negative	!
negative	i ordered a perfume during the first week of december , giving me plenty of time for the last christmas order date of the 00th .
neutral	product fine , however , delivery took two_weeks !
negative	i don_'_t realy want to have a public conversation - so can someone from easygates please call me as i have gates that don_'_t open !
negative	they advised that they would not be dispatching this until the 0rd_january , the same date as the manufacturer .
neutral	on closer_inspection , the side_panels seemed to have warped and are letting cold northerly winds penetrate deep into our home .
negative	my bank have now launched a fraud investgation against them .
negative	when i '_ve asked how long it will take them to get this item in , where told that they are not going to order this in .
negative	should not have even made it on the list !
negative	booked a parcel to be collected its still here 0 days_later !!
neutral	quite a high - maintenance item .
positive	pensions can be a mine_field for mere mortals but key_retirement_solutions made it easier to understand .
negative	i sent them my phone after they offered me £_00 , guess_what , i then received an_email_saying they had decided it was only worthy £_00 .
negative	he had not been !!
negative	i said i would get bill from t mobile showing phone_calls made day phone was sent .
neutral	i have never had this problem with ordering before , otherwise i would have given a five_star_rating , as your service is excellent
negative	despite 0 hours on the phone , they refuse to cancel .
neutral	not flexible for example i have annual_insurance for 0 but only i ski so when i asked for a week add on for me to ski the answer was just a straight no .
positive	have recommended to others and will certainly buy from them again .
positive	great sales !
negative	i balked a little at the £ 0 +_vat but was told that was because it was next_day delivery , so reluctantly i sucked it up .
positive	cheers !
negative	what does this mean .
negative	they took my money in seconds , but nearly a week_later they were still " processing " the order .
positive	in addition they provide lots of clear and helpful information for newbies to the world of vaping as well as posting interesting_articles on the subject .
neutral	charger is cheaper_elsewhere on the net .
positive	we purchase our salcura shower_gel on - line from natures healthbox and pay via_paypal .
negative	as it hasn_'_t ever actually worked , how can it be repaired .
neutral	regrettably , due to data_protection regulations , we ' re not able to communicate the specific reason_why the order has failed . please take this email as confirmation that your order has_been cancelled ."
positive	second time i '_ve_used serenata_flowers & ordered some for my mum '_s birthday .
positive	well_done " perfume - click ".
negative	easy money for them ?
positive	we sold 0 phones and got a good price .
positive	impressed .
negative	initially the response was good , understanding over the phone and had a good record of my past corespondents .
negative	bought 0 beyonce tickets for my wife for her xmas she was over the moon .
negative	0_weeks before our holiday they emailed to say accomodation was no_longer available .
negative	you company collect_+ really are incompetent and hte replies you are sending should be read by all future clients before they make the same mistake i did .
positive	despite this an excellent service and will definitely use this service again .
positive	many_thanks the delivery was very quick :-)
neutral	in store prices seem to be confusing and as long as i have my glasses on i will find the bargins .
negative	i am now waiting to chat to customer service again and have been waiting in the queue for over half an_hour .
positive	happy to use again
neutral	i was told it may take a week for me to receive them !!
neutral	i think it could be done more quickly if you could receive the credit against whatever you buy from them in one transaction .
positive	in all my dealings with trophy suppliers over the last few_years , this one is simply the best !
positive	very good experience .
negative	i now had a 00 month_contract and a tv package i did not want .
negative	just the clerk needed better training .
positive	the tuner i bought was broken by the postman forcing the package through the letter_box , but guitarbitz replaced it promptly without_question .
negative	then i called them back to cancel both contracts and they made the whole situaition lengthy and started_playing pass the parcel around with me .
neutral	always apologetic and polite responses but really , please , just sort_out city_link and get them to collect on the day they are supposed to !!
neutral	on a positive_note i would definitely use ' national_tyres spon end , coventry ' again as service was first_class a very ' can do ', professional and friendly service .
neutral	funny_thing is , all i received was the two items of which there were two of each which were sent by royal_mail in an envelope .
negative	do not bother ordering on line with this company .
negative	repairs 0 normally ask trust_pilot to remove these negative_reviews claiming they are not from real customers .
positive	if you need a site you can trust and provides great prices then this is the one to use .
negative	never will buy with this website anymore .
negative	the delivery would have been anytime the next_day however and they could not specify a time , even_though they had admitted it was their mistake they wouldn_'_t do a before 00am ( this is the reason for the 0_star ) also their refund policy is shocking at 00 days .
positive	for anyone_thinking of buying a stand for your guitar , then contact normans , they are a great company .
neutral	as the parts were dispatched the same day as the phone_call , i can only_assume the original email order was misplaced .
positive	great advice given
positive	no_quibble 00 day returns guarantee .
neutral	but i placed another order and had it delivered to my work place , not problems with this one .
positive	i was given a choice of a similar ring to the one i was initially looking for that could be delivered within 0 days so i ordered it .
negative	i was in a quandary ?
positive	0nd time i have made a purchase from eye_wear outlet and delivery and goods were excellent will allways recommend them and have done allready done so thank_you
neutral	i used this company for a while although i was never thrilled with the service .
positive	we have already_recommended them to others and told people of the ease this company made of our dealings .
neutral	although the products are great and i constantly got messages updating me on the order i placed , i feel as though the delivery has let the whole_experience down somewhat .
neutral	booked glasgow_airport_parking the week after and they do not charge anything for paying by credit_cards .
neutral	i then phoned hq_hair who advised that due to low stock the other item would be sent when it became_available .
negative	you '_d think my husband would be apoplectic by this point .
positive	one of the best things i have done was to join saa .
negative	sometimes cheap is not better , this is one of those cases .
neutral	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
negative	not good customer_relations really !
negative	the lady i spoke to was rude , lacked empathy and literally asked , ' what do you want me to do ?
neutral	i don_'_t think there is anything wrong with the mattress - certainly not enough to justify sending it back ( and i am sure if i had asked jr would have probably accepted / swapped it ).
neutral	order never arrived .
positive	used next_day service and was delivered at 0pm so you might want to got for timed optional_extra if delivering to work address
positive	travel_republic showed excellent communication keeping us informed of monarch '_s decision to cancel our flight by 0 day . they quickly reimbursed us for the loss of one nights accommation . all in all great service . will_definetly use them again .

positive	will use again in the futer
positive	delivered as promised and the product cost 00_% less_than b_& q
neutral	however the pain and discomfort was well_worth it i can see excellent now and i have no need to wear glasses .
positive	i had my free home_trial then ordered my glasses and they were delivered within a week , good quality glasses very happy
positive	thank_you
neutral	i tried to communicate with them but they use a message portal which does not confirm the content of your message for your records and invokes the usual numb call_center reply .
neutral	firstly , the label was put on the hem and therefore was visible through the blind .
neutral	decided to keep it because didn , t want the hassle of returning it .
negative	they kept me hanging on at_least 00_mins , then the girl who replied was so rude .
positive	ordered sales pack tues money in bank fri morning fast secure safe
negative	wasn_'_t too impressed when i made the order on some of the prices but the total was over £_000 so i went_ahead and used the free courier service .
positive	instant notification of funds received , and where required , funds immediately transferred .
positive	exactly as shown in the picture .
negative	could you please explain this ?
neutral	i have had big problems with wren also , they were aware that my wife had just recovered from cancer and i was recovering from a heart_attack but it made no difference they still treated us appallingly .
negative	i had a ' welcome ' email from them , and then a confirmation_email .
neutral	advertises payment same day until they receive phone and email_saying payment will take another week to clear
positive	jonathan winkler was great .
negative	!
neutral	having paid_extra for two day delivery did not expect to have to wait a week for delivery .
neutral	i ordered them for the day before her_birthday as we were going to france on her_birthday for lunch .
negative	i have been contacted by my very unhappy customer that he has not received his parcel today and when looking at the tracking , he will not get it until monday .
negative	sent away to stockport for a philips mp0_player .
negative	ordered coffee_table and occasional table .
negative	this company and any company associated to it is completely illegal and will either park your car in an unsafe place or they will steal your money .
negative	i was then sent an_email that said i had put in a new order for the tablets and would be charged accordingly ( again a second time ).
negative	who do they think they are ?
positive	the exante_diet is far more varied and much_easier than the cambridge_diet and a lot_cheaper .
positive	very easy and straight_forward .
negative	it '_s simply shifting of responsibility onto the purchaser .
positive	will definitely be using you again
positive	i '_d be using it even if there weren_'_t discounts , and there are lots of those .
positive	i am very pleased with the company and have bought from them befour , and will again , good and speedy service , and quality goods at a good price .
positive	the goods arrived promptly and in excellent condition .
neutral	their negatives are :
positive	!
neutral	i will try the service once more and if i see this type of behaviour again , i won_'_t continue .
positive	the customer service is second to none .
positive	très_bien , à_recommander
negative	it was a fees exempt form which i would have thought was a fairly standard form .
negative	we received an email_confirming that the duplicated payment would be refunded but we have now strated to receive the duplicated items by post .
neutral	after a week of not hearing_anything , i checked the order to find they were awaiting stock - this was not shown when purchasing the twin stroller , nor a follow_up email to say .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable and we will not be using this company again .
neutral	it is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone , email or forum .
negative	want to pick_up a trojan , adware , nagware or any other kind of malware ?
positive	excellent service .
positive	i was called to see if i wanted an_alternative , or if i was happy to wait .
negative	interesting to see if they bother to respond again . will keep you informed .
negative	i will be contacting them to get then to remove me from the mailing_list as they usually_write to me reminding_me regarding my service , not wanted any longer !
positive	excellent packaging too !
neutral	id_0000000
positive	bought some nike roshe sneaker boots .
positive	first i acturely phoned to check items where in stock and got a lot of help on the phone on the items i wanted and how they would sound ( speakers ) and all questions i had where answerd very well i acturely orderd after 0 and i still got my items next_day cant get any better really .
positive	a better car than i had booked .
negative	i checked the tracking at 00 . 00 supposedly they had tried to deliver and left a card .
neutral	was disappointed when the goods arrived as for two small storage racks i paid £_00 ( inc_vat ) for delivery and yet 0 of the uprights were just thrown in the delivery van with no protection on them , they were just taped_together at one end and in the middle with the kind of tape and labels that tears and leaves residue when you try to remove them .
negative	but not very impressed with the flowers !!!
positive	excellent service .
positive	it was a nice trip , didnt have any_problems and the staff made it enjoyable ive been useing dfds even before they changed their name and ive_seen their growth and changes and its good to see they havent forgotten who made them as big as they are . us
positive	absolutely , without_hesitation !
positive	wow , posted my phones on saturday_morning , money in my bank_account by monday lunch time .
negative	that is totally_unreasonable .
neutral	it was a bit_slow getting here but the return , bizarrely , was much_quicker .
neutral	the shoes i ordered were meant to be white but were a horrible cream colour , then i had to pay recorded post to return them . so not very happy
negative	when i rang to try and order it separately they updated the website to list it as a separate item but increased the price to £_000 !!
positive	the prints are amazing and really good value for money .
positive	bottom_line is this , the website is easy to use , and doing the required online stuff is quick and easy to make the sale of your used phone .
neutral	never was notified that the shipment was picked_up or that the payment went through .
negative	we had to cancel the sale of our suite and pay her £_00 compensation for her inconvenience .
neutral	that was such a feeble excuse and its absolutely rubbish .
positive	must be the best service you can get !
negative	yodels tracking_number starts with jd00
negative	will not be using again !
positive	pc_specialists - helpful information from the telephone support line , updated every_stage of the build and delivery process , swift postage ( even to the northern scottish_highlands !)
negative	when it was completed i was very pleased with the product .
neutral	we '_ve taken this tour a couple of times on our last 0 visits to london .
positive	i will also be recommending you to my friends .
positive	a good place to start in the world of vaping .
negative	paid £_000 for a pool less_than 0_months_ago and a hole has appeared on the bottom along the seam . they say that it is not a manufactures fault and won_'_t be taking my complaint any further . they still_haven_'_t bothered to contact me and from the picture i sent to them you can clearly see the hole is along the seam . i really can '_t see how they can say otherwise , their customer service is disgraceful
neutral	both are also very thin when mixed up so i don_'_t find them filling .
negative	cancelled order but they still took the money and no refund to date .
neutral	.
negative	i rejected it .
negative	neither i nor the intended_recipient had any communication during that time .
neutral	i got regular email_updates from the moment my order was placed .
neutral	if some of these points could be improved it be be and excellent service
neutral	you have say you call me ?
neutral	interesting that i then received an email_saying it had been delivered at 00 . 00 - yeah_right !
positive	they have unusual clothes for boys and girls , love their bits !
neutral	not good enough !
positive	will be returning again soon to choose more from this beautiful range .
neutral	not sure yet if i start getting calls from canvassing companys because my information has_been sold on ile stop useing the internet
neutral	however they were lost by the transport company , i found this out after ringing workwear_express on the 00th_jan .
negative	explained that i had said it was their fault but it was the reason_why i wished to have them changed quicker_than 0_days was told that they were not an_emergency service but i shouldn_'_t drive my car !
neutral	the speed of return was excellent , but i shall be very wary of including b_&_w images in any future orders .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 are you saying i have to pay to get it back after its yodels mistake ?
positive	saa shop has an amazing range of art_materials and i have been really pleased with the paints , paper and other materials i have purchased since i joined a year_ago .
positive	product just as_described .
neutral	she told me that the parcel had been dispatched but could take up to 00 working_days for delivery .
negative	ordered flowers well in time for valentine '_s day then got an e_- mail at 00 :_00pm on the 00th_feb to say the courier can '_t find the address ?
neutral	waltons were friendly and helpful , but the actual supplier could only offer one delivery date , which wasn_'_t brilliant given that this was the first day of term and the shed was for a small pre_- school .
negative	on opening the box i found the sink was covered in mud and dirt with deep_scratches all over !
negative	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
neutral	these capsules just do not work well in my nespresso latissimo machine .
positive	would certainly use again and would recommend to anyone_thinking of buying from you .
negative	considering we live in telford and they were going to middlesex - this is really inconvient .
negative	please do not use this company - shocking service
negative	having checked now though , i see it '_s gone .
negative	never again .
negative	sure_enough they were trying to bill me in advance and also had the cheek to try to add an extra £_00 for the direct_debit being cancelled .
negative	the colours are darker_than my photo .
negative	it is incredible that they are cheating on you .
positive	both deliveries were quick , cheap prices , and no_hassle .
negative	being a corporate customer of ups , i know that ups will not charge parcelhero full - rate for this .
neutral	bought this as the option was for next_day delivery .
neutral	wwhere the service fell down was that had i not have logged on to the tracker i would not have known .
neutral	checked with their online help to make_sure ok for my jag x type .
neutral	- and wanted to charge an extra £_00 for delivery !
neutral	code recieved within 00_hrs , there was a couple of steps missing on the instructions , but as there was a link to a video_tutorial that sorted the issue i had .
positive	oh , they do glasses from £ 0 . 00 too and they are stylish so a set of readers or distance lenses for sport are on the cards too !
neutral	it is however a conveniant service and one i have used for many_years .
negative	it has taken nearly a week and my customer still doesn_'_t have his parcel .

negative	therefore , making early settlement impractical and very expensive .
positive	a very good service .
negative	had to remove my review after [_name removed_] ( well , that '_s the western name he went by then ) deliberately withheld my money and required me to remove it before refunding me .
positive	great delivery and a nice and helpfull website .

positive	delivery excellent nothing to fault .
negative	no sign of goods .
neutral	a similar brand at sw was more exp and their ship rate was over $_00 , totalling $_000 .
negative	calling the customer helpline is of no use whatsoever ; yes they are very kind and borderline helpful in that they can tell you your order will ( yet again ) be sent out the next_day , but i '_m afraid that '_s no good when the driver doesn_'_t bother to show then claims you weren_'_t home .
neutral	yes , what was nice that i got second bunch as compensations for free .
negative	am planning on ringing bedeck later as only one if two items has shown up and the receipt in the box said two items should be there .
negative	ebay buyer blaming me for damage .

negative	selected the shower we wanted , and although not in stock the website confirmed could order and would be available for collection monday 0th_june .
neutral	my order took over a week to arrive , after having requested 0 - 0_days ' delivery , but arrive it did , in good condition .

positive	i find i '_m using naturesbest more and more for my vitamins and supplements .
positive	this wasn_'_t available on line so we phoned and they couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
positive	funnily , you only make contact with a companies personnel when there is a problem , and its at these times , it can make or break your experience .
negative	the refund took_ages , i eventually had to threaten them with a letter of action to even get it through .

positive	after_placing my first order with viovet i was anxious that the tablets would not come on time but viovet even phoned me to advise that they thought i had ordered the wrong medicine .
negative	probably the worst experience i have ever had .
negative	well .
positive	my honest view about powerbeck is they are amazing !
positive	the young_lady was very polite and knowledgeable , gave the appropriate advice and took my order .
negative	so you can try by the products elsewhere thinking it '_s in stock , get charged , then the same thing , they finally tell you they own the companies too
neutral	i called to book my delivery it never arrived on the friday so i called to chase and they denied all knowledge even_though i had the guys name they said they '_d never spoken to me , he said he was the only one who answered the phone but after he hung_up on me mid call i called back and an equally rude_woman answered .
neutral	it was agreed the tyre would be fitted the day after , but in the morning .
neutral	so why did i pay almost a tenner for a ups delivery that didn_'_t ever happen ???
negative	so we assumed that we would receive the machines within a week .
neutral	i have not complained again but will not be using clare_florist again as the quality of the flowers used appears to be below_par .
negative	informed that order had not been put on delivery truck .
negative	i ordered the same product from another company on the wednesday and it was delivered on the saturday which is the service i expect .
positive	i would definately use them again as the display was very unusual and were worth the money .
positive	bought a mains / cigarette lighter adapter .
negative	poor company in general .
positive	good service and great prices every time .
negative	so anyway conclusion is that i have been charged_twice for no service what so ever and on top of that no one will talk to me , i would not recommend this service to anyone , if possible use another company , maybe one with a bit more people skills
negative	why was i given the option when i order it to have it delivered to another address if this is not possible .
neutral	thankfully none of the contents were fragile nor were any of the bags of food broken as previously .
neutral	it arrived satisfactorily .
neutral	quite a lot of effort when i only received £ 0 . 00 for my old_mobile !
neutral	probably not .
negative	i informed paypal that the order had been cancelled and that i was due a full_refund .
negative	!
neutral	i '_m not sure_whether i didn_'_t read everything properly or things weren_'_t made clear on the website but it wasn_'_t what i expected and put a bit of a dampener on the start of our_honeymoon .
negative	fortunately for me as this was paid for with paypal , i have been able to open a dispute case via them so it '_s now in the trustful hands of paypal to get my money back for me .
positive	would recommend to anyone .
negative	all in all my experiences with kwik_fit was incredibly disappointing and i will not be using their service again

positive	the service they give is exceptional
negative	i just told them , to put them back as i '_m sick of asda ripping me off with fake offers .
negative	we will certainly reconsider before using iflorist again .
neutral	ford_fiesta durashift seized after 00000 miles bought from jennings middlesbrough as an automatic turns_out it is semi automatic !!!!!
neutral	and it was delivered today without the extra_charge .
neutral	i am pleased with the bed , it looks nice and went together easily enough .
negative	only a vague email which i thought meant i didn_'_t have a seat .
positive	recommended highly .
negative	which is ok , it '_s fine .
negative	i then have been sitting on the phone daily to speak to someone but never anyone answers .
negative	this isn_'_t a corporate bank or law firm - flowers are a personal , human thing .
positive	the one miinor thing that is not very good is when they send orders by royal_mail over whom they have no control and who are particulary bad in my area .
neutral	i have friends who have had great experiences with this company ; sadly , i think it very much depends on the luck of the draw as to which guide you get .
positive	the bottle of hine i ordered for my mother '_s birthday was delivered directly to her with a birthday message .
positive	i have always used collectplus to send returned items back , never an issue .
neutral	to add even when i called the store by phone i was told an email would be sent out and no email was delivered .
negative	jeg_har også kørt en klagesag i forbrugerklagenævnet ( som_jeg vandt ), da telenor nægtede at reparere en løs home - knap , da deres eget værksted insisterede først på , at der_var tale om en vandskade , og telefonens garanti derfor ikke var gældende , men ændrede deres vurdering til , at vandskaden var årsag til at home - knappen sad løst (?!

positive	caroline was very helpful , told me exactly_what would happen and put my fears to rest .
neutral	however , my reading_glasses keep slipping off my face .
positive	old_fashioned service , updated on delivery and order status throughout .
negative	advertising stated free delivery on orders over £_00 .
negative	if you would like to check the status of your account , you can log in at any time .
neutral	however size came up small so wanted to exchange .
neutral	the advice was to go for the larger_size .

positive	the order was despatched very quickly and arrived in only a couple of days !
neutral	a little_disappointing but i couldn_'_t tell them in australia that it was anything other than ' spectacular ' ( which , sadly , it really wasn_'_t )
positive	from sales through order processing to delivery very professional and efficient .
negative	and losing loyal_customers throucj your prtniship with c0sta .
negative	today is february 00th and they have still not arrived .
negative	wouldn_'_t really mind but £_00 for 0 cardboard_boxes is outrageous .
positive	i would definitely recommend mazuma_mobile to friends .
positive	with excellent , polite and considerate service from every member of staff involved .
negative	it would seem that as long as the order is straight_forward then a good service , sadly , please be aware that if a problem is encountered you may be left hanging , or ignored .
positive	the first time i have used eflorist .
neutral	because of this one order went to a home address and the other had to go to store - because the cost wasn_'_t high enough , i emailed customer_services within minutes of placing the order to ask for all items to go together as spent quite a bit but was told this was not possible . i just think its a shame that this could not have been done for me as now i have the 0 rolls at my house but still need to drive and collect the other 0 .
positive	they didn_'_t pressure me into buying anything ( i did that all on my own ).
neutral	i sent an_email about this and am still_waiting on a reply !!

neutral	i ordered a nest of tables from argos about 0_weeks_ago .

negative	i would never consider_using or recommending this company .
negative	said i would get a refund at some point in the future when they had followed all their procedures to find the parcel and determined that a refund was due .

positive	just the sort of company that i like to deal with , good iitems plenty of information , speedy delivery !

positive	the online site is clear and easy to use .
neutral	shame about delivery , ok so i didn_'_t pay as i opted for the free service , but if i knew it would have taken over a week to receive the parcel i would have defiantly paid for postage .

neutral	all and all a great website and idea but the customerservice does need to improve .
neutral	i will use you again , but keep that person away from me !
negative	i understand you pay the market rate for this sort of thing , but there is no competition - as far as i can see viagogo were the only option - and can therefore charge what they like .
neutral	they say you ' re saving 00_% but in fact if you shop around a bit the saving is more like 00_% or even 0 .
negative	unfortunately , my package was in the street , two road away where i lives ; the box was damaged and three items were laid around the torn box with another two items missing ; which i ordered five in total .
neutral	it means you have to watch the traffic entering the airport and wave to the driver to catch his / her eye when you have identified your vehicle .
negative	your postal_system was crap , my goods wre given to my neighbour , and i will not be using dive_inn for future , unless you can make it more secure .
neutral	but looking today , the website still is showing the green & white .
positive	thanks to everyone_involved .
neutral	the flowers were tightly_packed and all the roses were on one side - not well displayed .
negative	however , i forgive you and will not be replying to anything_else you say as i do not wish to lower myself to your standards .

positive	i ws particularly in the personal e_- mail i received updating me on the status of the delivery and giving me the option to wait for certain items or receive two deliveries .
neutral	in addition i was told that the shoes would be delivered on a particular day by email only to find that the seller did not even have them in stock on that day .
negative	i have learnt my lesson .
positive	the website is simple , the choice of clothing is very broad .
neutral	the other channels just don_'_t float the boat , 000 channels and nothing on .
neutral	it has to be said that my wife ( who went for a soft as she is lighter ) does not have this issue and is happy .
positive	👍
neutral	when i complained and offered to send two examples back , your technician got back to me quickly enough but said that the quality was in the suitable range .
positive	a simpler way to do your shopping .
neutral	i ordered 0 separate items together and yet you delivered them separately .

positive	thank_you
positive	this is a first_class company for all your shower needs can '_t recommend them enough .
neutral	- very spacious_villa , there was only 0 of us ( sleeps 0 ) but you never felt on top of each other
negative	another wasted day .
negative	i for one will never use a company who_uses_yodel again and if any yodel courier steps foot on my property again i have told them they will be trespassing and i will call the police .
positive	bought this as a birthday_present for my son and he is thrilled with it
positive	quick and simple to order .
positive	from the very moment i ordered my watch right up to taking delivery of it , chris and his_team were incredibly professional , communicative and always went the extra_mile .
neutral	easy to find the desks and cars at the airport , nice modern car and at a reasonable price .
positive	available to the customer and very secure online .
negative	the most recently delivery was attempted to an incorrect_address then dropped_off at the corner_shop ( our preferred place when we are not at home , at_least they got that right this time ).
positive	great website , excellent selection and super_fast free delivery !
neutral	surprised it was packed and posted !
neutral	so i had to make a bank tranfer and pay the pertinent fee .
positive	i can_honestly_say that it '_s changed my life having_laser_eye_surgery .
neutral	the bljnds i ordered arrived on time but not made as i ordered 0cm short in width and very long but i was able to use them after adjustments i should have checked them before hanging them
neutral	and you sample order charge is too high at £ 0 . 00 is too high also
negative	item ( premium jeans from a leading department_store ) delivered on time and undamaged , but by the rudest delivery man i '_ve ever_encountered .
negative	does that look like 00 days notice prior to suspension to anyone ?
neutral	and don_'_t start me on the delivery !
neutral	the badges were lovely but the colours have turned_out very dark :( almost unreadable .
neutral	when we took pool cover off on first day there was a dead grass / seaweed we had to get out of bottom of pool
positive	we bought a high_quality real oak chest of drawers - ready assembled - at a bargain price .
negative	two hours_later i have still not received a phone_call thus meaning that i will possibly have to try to borrow money to feed my family for the weekend and beyond until i can actually purchase my intended items from a different company .
negative	fair_enough , we called them .
negative	i bought an iphone_0s on contract as a present for someone overseas , all was explained to orange company and they said they were going to unlock the fone within 0_months .
negative	paid £_000 + for trainers that i found slightly_cheaper afterwards with next_day delivery .
negative	so i rang talktalk and was told i could transfer my contract to someone_else ( i '_m not lumbering someone_else with this rubbish ) pay the extortionate cancellation_fee in a lump_sum that would be taken from my account or put up and shut up and get on with another 00 months of this garbage .
negative	if i could rate with no stars , i would .
negative	there are friendships and relationships riding on it .
negative	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
positive	i will definitely check out cheapsmells first next time .
negative	no notice left ?
negative	purchased a vehicle workshop_manual online download .
neutral	i do not think with the reviews that hermes are getting on trustpilot . com and also facebook that they will be around for much longer .
neutral	placed my order on their site , was advised in stock and would be delivered the next wroking day if ordered before 00 .
neutral	no explanation or apology offered .
neutral	you couldn_'_t ask for better value broadband and calls than my deal with talktalk ( previously tiscali ) but the different parts of the company don_'_t talk top each other and when something_goes_wrong the customer_services_department simply cannot fix it .
negative	from then on they charge us double and do not quite doing it .
positive	the price for the lens i got was also the cheapest i could_find so overall i couldn_'_t have been any happier with how the whole_process went .
negative	the service from bsm is very poor indeed .
negative	0 employers then tried to get a walnut key onto my alloy and all failed .
positive	well lets just say , what i would pay for 0_months at the vets , i can get for a whole year at petmeds .
positive	on the one occasion i had any difficulty venere were quick and helpful to ensure the matter was satisfactorily_resolved .
positive	it would have been great to be told exactly how this should have been done .
positive	fast reliable service beautiful bouquets
positive	excellent machine , easy to assemble , once on it you will not want to get off .
neutral	great service
positive	arrived on monday just after 0 . 00 a . m . driver named alan very nice .
positive	we were given a lot of good advice - in my opinion - and not once given the hard_sell .
negative	pine_solutions , appliances on lines and , bath store for proactive customer_services and efficiency .
negative	in 0 emails sent over a 0 week period , i have one reply .
positive	the product was good and fairly_priced .
negative	judging from their track_record so_far , i '_m not holding my breath .
negative	if they can debit my account with speed and efficiency , then they can credit the money back with the same speed and effciency !!!
negative	i checked at 0pm that night and the tracking_info said it was last tracked at the east_london depot at 00 : 00 - so at_least it left the post_office - but then , against the tracking it said " collection attempted - parcel not available " and also " refused acceptance " at 00 : 00 which looks like the receiver would not take it .
positive	no_problems on any occasion just a swift delivery of my order - no_fuss - no_problems
negative	never in all my years of online shopping have i received such appaling service .
positive	very well impressed and will use again .
positive	fab item and very stylish !
negative	the value of the beds and the expertise of the sales_staff was completely undermined by the attitude and carelessness of the delivery crew for dreams .
positive	i visited a store in brecon at the weekend and was impressed by the competent staff and good range of products .
positive	would use shoetique again and highly rec
negative	perfect iphone , absolutely no_problems with it , great condition .
negative	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
negative	do not trust anything they say .
negative	in july they mysteriously stopped taking my dds , unfortunately i did not notice for a few_months but having presumed they would have spent the money in my account .
neutral	won_'_t use again !
negative	false_advertising comes to mind especially as all the deals shown did not include the bundle pack .
neutral	i was informed of my delivery day so i arranged to be in all day so that i didn_’_t miss the parcel only to check online at 0pm that apparently my goods were back at the depot due to a failed delivery attempt !
positive	this item was so beautifully made that it was even better_than on the sales screen .
neutral	asked several questions about proposed purchase and no one was able to help , had to go and risk the item being sold while i consulted the web .
positive	pawel our local delivery driver is polite , efficient and cheerful which gives a human side to the delivery service .
negative	worse of all the headset was loose so when i pushed down on the handlebars they rotated .
positive	goods ordered were delivered by the next available post , securely_packaged .
neutral	that '_s worth of it to sell some old_mobiles & give money to charity .
negative	the fast payment statement is a joke as my phone was tested and accepted on the 00th , but i won_'_t get my money until the 00th as it can take up to 0 working_days to send the payment apparently .
negative	sent 0 cards on the 0 / 00 / 00 and the 0 recipients of the cards only received them 0day . thats 00 days for delivery , thats too long , especially with it was £ 0 . 00 for the delivery .!
negative	update 00 weeks on from wrens response below :
positive	will_continue to use in the future and tell everyone about the great service .
neutral	repairs were required to get the blind up in the end .
positive	once found the door was easy to collect items ( could do with an obvious sign to say ring the bell near the collection door )
neutral	easy to order and prompt delivery .
positive	size quoted was 00 / 00 , my daughter is a size 00 , and she couldn_'_t fit into it .
negative	not very reliable at all
positive	i was kept_updated with the order progress and it arrived the following_day .
negative	this was not made clear at all when i made my order .
neutral	it might be that it is how it is supposed to be .
neutral	good delivery but immediately started sending adds with no unsubscribe facility .
negative	i even allowed an extra 00 days from order date before i needed the card .
neutral	three_times in the last 0_weeks they have failed to pick_up and then delivered my products up to a week late .
neutral	this will help force more repetition and more learning rather_than writing a few poor sentences that get badly marked and then proceeding to the next unit without actually learning anything .
negative	i phoned again in the evening and they actually gave_me the drivers number and when i spoke to her i was told after a large huff that she had just been in my area and that she had finished work for the day !!
neutral	i spoke with the sales director who explained that this was due to delays by suppliers , but still i feel something needs resolving in the process since the customer outcome is the same .
neutral	we agreed another day and told that we would need to phone the day before to get a time window for delivery .
positive	i completed the order and it was quick and easy to pay .
positive	very straightforward to deal with , deal completed within 0 working_days with no_hassle from potential_buyers on ebay .
neutral	you see if i don_'_t
neutral	i noticed that the dates had defaulted to the date i had made the booking .
negative	!
neutral	i have contacted national_helpline , they come_back to me straight_away , they were very quick to find out what i need it help with , after that i just got a letter that they want be able to take my case .
positive	brilliant service thanks - shame i have no more old ones !
positive	thank_you
positive	we arranged to have old machine collected and whilst driver was not aware of this on their paperwork they still took it away .
negative	i then gave up , got my money back and went elsewhere .
positive	i will definetely shop again .
positive	the best service from ordering to receiving .
negative	i am a loyal and regular customer and the question should never have been asked .
negative	a month had past and still no refund !
positive	a good range of products and at good prices ( and i have trawled the net looking !
neutral	easy to book and items collected and delivered as quoted and good price .
negative	none in stock .
neutral	however , the packing wasn_'_t good .
neutral	ten_minutes into trying to make the purchase above i lost the will to live !
positive	if you have to get one i highly_recommend this one
neutral	fast delivery , but envelope with bubbles and torn boxes , containing the cables did not appear damaged .
positive	if you ever need anything give them a try .
positive	being a grandad makes easy use and good service essential .
negative	for a communications company with hundreds of staff , i '_m_sure there is at_least 0 person that i corresponded with that could have helped_me out !!!!
negative	there is a problem with the online procurement system .
neutral	slower_than second class postage .
positive	when my glasses arrived ( surprisingly quickly ) i realised that the prescription had been entered into the system wrong , somehow .
negative	my sister put an order in for an easter_egg to be sent to me , i didnt find out about this till a month after easter when my sister asked me what i thought of it and my reply was ' what easter_egg ?'.
neutral	really quite disappointed now that i should have chosen to buy with sta instead which is £_00 higher than travel up .
positive	very happy with it .
negative	i explained that at no time was this ever mentioned in the initial call selling us the deal , but he was equally adamant that we keep it or pay £_000 as the telephone and broadband deal we were on prior to this upgrade was not now available .
neutral	i rather next time if the person would take a minute just to knock .
neutral	rose is beautiful . really pleased however delivery was a nightmare . gave clear_instructions to leave at moxoms joinery if we were not in , card was posted at number 00 next door not the annexe as written on my adreess , had to track parcel on internet to find out where it had gone and then try to locate thepost office where it had been left . luckily we have a god relationship with our neighbours at number 00 but meant that delivery was unaccounted for fofr 00_hrs so missed the date i wanted it to arrive for . apart_from the delivery i am extremely pleased with the rose
negative	a couple of hours on the radiator sorted it – but that ’_s not the point .
positive	told friends what good value qtag is , hope they will visit your site
negative	my experience is similar to many others here , place order , money taken , thats the last i heard from them !
negative	after booking a double ( see above ) i was told was getting an upgrade to a double ?!
positive	the flowers were delivered promptly and were , by all accounts , large , beautiful , handtied , heavy flowers !
negative	goodbye healthspan you will not get another order from me .
positive	we stayed at the villa atlantico in corralejo , fuerteventura in may_0000 .
positive	if you are a small animal_lover little pet wharehouse is a must use website .
negative	the worst back to ocado for me .
positive	thank_you !
neutral	all they had to do was to report my review and now noone can see it till it is put back , and then it will be at the bottom of the tread , so noone will know . a bit too easy for the retailer to manipulte i think . trustpilot should not take down reviews without having looked at them in my opinion .
negative	i don_'_t know how they have the cheek to firstly charge double for the actual ticket price on top of a booking_fee and n enormous delivery charge .
negative	you would expect more from the company like this but hey they just lost a customer as we are spending at_least £_000 a year on a sporstwear ( or even more if i include cycling_kit ).
negative	as if i would want to go through this experience again !!
neutral	hermes who were the culprit got away scott free ( or so they think ).
neutral	i clicked on it to find more info , and was directed to a page ; this , at the bottom , mentioned another course , taking place on a different day , which i could book at a special price if i booked both together , which i did .
positive	great selection , great turnaround .
neutral	that was good from viagogo i liked the reassurance .
positive	this company is easy to order from and has always been very efficient at getting the products to me i wouldnt_hesitate to recommend them
neutral	this is a bit of a con , had i know this i would not have made the purchase .
neutral	dont like the new timeline and dont_think we should be made to swap to it !
neutral	i opted for monovision ie a reading eye and a driving eye and personally i would not recommend this perhaps for me the sacrifice on long vision for reading was too great .
negative	order 000000000 the entire £_00 of roses was dead within two_days and the other bunch resembled a garage bunch if i '_m honest and nothing like picture .
negative	after getting no help from selectspecs i took them to a high_street_opticians and got them to test them for me and even write up a little report that shows of the 0 measurements needed to made a pair of glasses , 0 of theses measurement were different to what i ordered .
negative	if , like me , this is a reason to stay , rest_assured , they don_'_t .
positive	why_bother with the high_street ?
neutral	i sent my phone off but had a few problems with checkmend , fonebank were good occasionally on keeping_me in the loop of what was going on , but where i was meant to receive £_000 for my blackberry ive only received a cheque of £_00 without_any note or phonecall to say why they are taking £_00 off the price they said in the first place which i think is really unfair .
negative	so i ordered the calendar from photobox ( again which only took a few mins and was much_easier to use than jessops ) but i had no option but to order the cushion from jessops because i couldn_'_t find anything similar elsewhere that would still deliver in time for christmas .
positive	great product - keeps my pup happy for a little while so good buy .
neutral	i tried to pay with 0 different debit_cards unsuccessfully .
positive	excellent service , have used mazuma about 0 times without_any_problems
neutral	so not a very good start .
positive	this website had the best price with fsat delivery .
negative	i have placed many orders with this company and while despatch is often very slow and they advertise items they have no stock of , i have always lived with this but now they have gone too far .
positive	the banner is amazing and the quality is great .
negative	and like a lot of reviews .
neutral	i would say the wardrobe took me 0 hours to assemble by myself .
positive	excellent .
negative	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
neutral	i have upgraded from 0_star to 0_stars , as i believe everyone should be allowed to get the chance to correct a problem , and i did notice i had a swift response from interparcel themselves very quickly so watch this space and see what happens .
positive	thanks
neutral	how exactly could the delivery have been made if the lock on my oil_tank had not been busted ?
negative	you have been warned .
negative	paid altogether nearly_£_000 for these tickets .
neutral	left it a few_days .
neutral	not just sat on top of the router .
negative	i called buyfencingdirect and was sarcastically told " it '_s not hard , you screw them to the gate ". not very useful and a little rude !
neutral	tried every diy_store possible and couldn_'_t find one .
neutral	was pretty good .
negative	if , however , you or any member of your family enjoys online gaming , streaming online television services ( netflix , etc_.)
neutral	this means i won_'_t be ordering items form here often .
negative	as you were the specified courier i was surprised by this .
neutral	when i called the office , the woman_who answered simply kept_repeating ' well that '_s where you have to leave it '.
neutral	i would want better packaging .
neutral	chap said he would have to look into it and would ring back .
negative	there was a rose ' plant ', which was weathered , had only two flowers left on it ( the remainder were in the bottom of the package !
negative	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing_ones .
positive	i ordered raw meal from blue_herbs which arrived immediately and is an excellent product !
negative	two_weeks_later , i call them ( note , not the other way round ), only to be told that suddenly the part is out of stock , that someone must have coincidentally ordered the same ( very rare ) part at exactly the same time .
neutral	the process was straightforward and went well .
negative	for eight_years it was a great little service but now it seems that they no_longer care , shame .
neutral	i am not stupid and i know what breakdown insurance is and i also know i can get it far more cheaply than ao '_s offer .
neutral	after putting my call on hold for a long time , she then said there was nobody available to provide the information .
positive	from attending a krs seminar to receiving my cheque took just over ten weeks which , considering the work involved , is really very good .
negative	?
negative	first pair ripped as i put one foot in .
neutral	asked for flowers to be left with neighbour if no one in but instead simply but a card through door and put them over the wall into back garden where the dog was and could have destroyed them .
positive	ordered a replacement track for my mother , which came very quickly .
negative	where indicated a fully working charger must be included
neutral	as the ingredients are not listed i won_'_t risk ordering again .
neutral	on the whole not bad service but i should have been kept_updated immediately after the two_weeks .
positive	cv_knowhow took all the stress out of compiling all my information together and presented it in a very professional way , which i '_m_sure played its part in gettig the interviews that led to my new job !
positive	great next_day delivery well_packaged an quality goods
neutral	however , it didn_'_t work .
neutral	only when i enquired_about price match did i get a problem .
neutral	the villa was spacious and the garden area was lovely as per previous reviews , however the villa could do with updating as it is somewhat tired inside , ( especially the kitchen area and bathrooms ).
neutral	then my 0nd dealing_with this company was just as farcical , firstly trying to use the prescription upload system which is clearly broken and then being told a week_later after i ' d already had an order confirmation_email_stating they are waiting for my prescription before they can send the items out , clearly not good enough in my book .
negative	i could not change this and , therefore , could not buy the offer .
negative	nothing .
negative	i contacted jessops_photo and as i was not going to be in glasgow apart_from that day , i asked for the photos to be sent to my home address .
negative	howveer the really funny part is that they then delivered the thing a few_days_later but seemed totally_unaware of until i asked them why they had done that .
positive	early on in the process daniel was very understanding and we discussed in depth budget , location and duration .
neutral	my second took about three_weeks to come with no contact about the delay until initiated by me .
positive	both arrived next_day from the orders being placed .
positive	it looks exactly like my design .
positive	i '_m delighted with the table ( cornilleau_sport 000 ).
neutral	i asked her if she could change it , but she said it wasn_'_t possible .
negative	see eflorist there are florists in her area who will deliver at short_notice !
positive	all in all , a fantastic service .
negative	!
positive	i use this company regularly for batteries for my mac [ remote keyboard and mouse ] and have never been disappointed by the purchase .
negative	but the story dosent end there . then they say weve got keys post them up £_00 . 00 but no way to buy them on the site i ask on facebook how to the as if by magic the price goes to £_00 . 00 and you can buy it what a joke !!!!!
neutral	we ( parents ) were told that our children would have ' studio shots ' taken which would be of professional quality .
positive	very pleased with the first_class service and great price i will be using you for all my future pet_supplies
positive	i posted the phone back .
negative	no communication from wae_+ at all , and no delivery .
positive	confirmation of offer once phone was received by them was quick and payment was treansferred on the day stated .
positive	i will definitely be returning in the future .
negative	disgrace disgrace disgrace no matter_how you change your name your still crap !!
negative	as they charge interest daily , by them refusing to take your payment because of their system problems , you '_ll pay more interest as items are charged from the date they appear on your account , so if it takes you longer to get your money onto the account they are raking up even more interest and its not your fault their systems fail .
neutral	i booked 0 people in 0 different flights , need vegatarian on all and aj was very good but he had to keep putting me on hold .
neutral	they accepted my cancellation & organised the collection of what i cant eat for the next_day with a refund .
negative	i have used quidco for years but they seem to be declining more and more cashback .
negative	no telephone_number available anywhere .
neutral	i am not so happy to have received your email today telling_me that if i had delayed placing my order until this week i would have received a 00_% discout !
positive	if you are ever having a moment where the spark of an idea of a purchase comes into your head .
negative	would rather pay more and receive my product .
neutral	i understand that tesco '_s money currency is managed bu travelex .
positive	very good company !
neutral	does anyone really fall for it ?
positive	a well_known high_street shop quoted me £_000 . 00 just to replace my lenses in my old frames .
negative	i first used logodesignguarantee . co . uk in april_0000 for my partners window cleaning company and was pleased with the simple yet personal design i received , so when my mother in - law asked me about a logo for her business i was happy to recommend them and placed the order with all details of what she wanted and attached pictures .
positive	! always 000_%, and the prices are fantastic highly_recommend
negative	the lady at the travel centre said that there was nothing she could do and it was the choo choo trainline '_s responsibility .
neutral	some of the information the sales_assistants gave_me was conflicting or incorrect , better knowledge of the prams i felt was needed .
positive	it was just over a week until my girlfriend '_s 00th_birthday fancy_dress party , so i was a bit_worried_about what to get and whether it would arrive in time .
neutral	its a lot of work for what turns_out to be only a small refund , but if you have nothing better to do with your time , give it a go !
neutral	so straight after the assembly i had to lock the costume away in a cupboard and it won_'_t be seeing the light of day again .
negative	by this time it was midnight so i emailed the help_desk and went to bed .
negative	then she was telling_me to speak proper english and hanged up .
positive	hopefully my girlfriend will be as impressed as i am .
negative	i find out later this is all lies .
positive	i got new lenses from contactlenses . co . uk and not only were they a fantastic price they were with me really quick thought being cheap the lenses would not be that good of quality but how wrong was i they we ' re comfy straight off and even after 00_hours still didn_'_t who '_s i was wearing them so much_better_than my old spec_savers ones
positive	i have now ordered via their website a medium and a large size of both the rover and the titan mitts , so that i can try them on at home , decide what i want and send the other 0 pairs back under their free return service .
positive	easy to use website , good products and fast delivery .
positive	so_far i would recommend this company
neutral	love my iphone .
neutral	the bottle of bubbly , so would be hesitant_about ordering from the site again .
negative	i cancelled orders for deposit protection and rent collection due to lack of faith .
positive	they delivered what was ordered on time
positive	a wonderful model that takes time to build but well_worth the effort .
neutral	the girl on collections desk was absolutely_brilliant in that as there was no paperwork to mention i was collecting the strimmer from 00pm onwards , she had to phone round and chase up paperwork only to not get anywhere , but luckily there was a strimmer in stock and she was able to sort something out for me .
neutral	for some reason after a while they seemed to change their mind and send me the code anyway . am i no_longer suspicious then ?
neutral	it was exactly as i expected inside and i '_m_sure they '_ll all taste lovely but the basket seems a little_bit cheap and the bow tied around it wasn_'_t cut , it was hacked .
neutral	i have been on diet_chef for a while and planning on stopping this due to fact that i have felt ill consistently since been on this .
neutral	chat box popped up on several_occasions , but no one replied , and we could not shut it down or move it away from the centre of the screen , so could not read what was on screen behind it .
positive	well_done on a first_class service from_start to finish .
positive	i ordered two pair of glasses , when they came they were fabulous and of good quality but one pair didn_'_t fit me so i contacted glasses_direct , the service was fabulous they let_me return them and pick a new frame , i would defiantely shop with them for the next pair of glasses i need , the service and contact from then was 00 out of 00 .
neutral	i complained about this to the nice and helpful cutomer service .
negative	two of them would have made an equally_impressive bouquet .
neutral	i must_say the english description will be better_than chinese .
negative	i ordered a bunch flowers from serenata for my mother , next_day delivery as promised .
positive	i received the cd_key within 0 minutes of placing my order !
neutral	ordered two_pairs and was told they needed more details about my prescription .
neutral	a few_days_later it stopped_working and the battery had to be replaced .
positive	very helpful customer service staff who helped to locate some srock for me and made sure it was all okay before sending out to us .
negative	!
positive	0 frame broke within a week .
positive	cost_effective and fun uses for magnets !
positive	the price was competitive and there was a free leather wallet included in the deal , along with free delivery and a discount_code .
positive	and i was not disappointed , the worktops arrived right on time to be fitted by my carpenter .
negative	update , update , update !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	a very good quality product supplied fast however the guy manning the phones at the bury branch let the company down .
negative	i ordered my domain on friday ( it '_s now saturday ) and they have said i have to wait for monday !

negative	only stayed there 0 nights .
negative	these people are impossible to reach on the phone , and calling an 0000 number from a mobile and holding on for 00 - 00 minute stretches at a time costs a fortune !
neutral	it was easy to buy my bracelet but can '_t actually feel any benefit after wearing it for a few_weeks .
neutral	i should not have to explain_why i don_'_t want your insurance nor should my decision be questioned .
positive	i don_'_t often return things as sizing is generally spot_on with their own branded clothing and the brands they supply , but when i have had to return it has_been free and the refund is actioned really quickly .
neutral	tyres and price ok garage used one stop not so good .
negative	im tired of online site when they updated after you pay them for something which is out of stock
neutral	the photobook we received was really good but the 0st time i tried to upload the photos i got an_error_message and didn_'_t know if the order had been processed .

neutral	free delivery was offered but maybe that meant smaller bouquet
neutral	however , when i tried my glasses on for the first time , the frames were wonky .
positive	they arrived 0_days as advertised and took us 00_mins and a rolling pin to put_together , they are exactly the same as the more_expensive ones in the other classroom and we paid much less .

neutral	the instructions on the paper_work about where to drop_off were confusing and when we called for help were told something different completely .
negative	well someone_who had no common_sense did just this !
positive	they did the work and pointed_out some other issues that needed attention in the future .
positive	i then got several emails to let_me know the status of the order which is great .

positive	atom00 has_been a partner agency for a few_years on a major client - and they certainly know their online onions inside out .
positive	very simple and easy process !
neutral	delivery did not meet the final 00 day deadline and i chose a 0 wheel vehicle to make it easier for the company to deliver which_meant i did not receive discounts .
neutral	regardless , i was asked lots more questions ( information already provided ) and put through to a solicitor .
negative	00 pounds service fee ???
neutral	i do appreciate the resolution to the problem , but it '_s a shame it took so long to sort_out .
negative	gave_me 0 different emails to send it to then said it was to late .
neutral	however the man who answered the phone on my return 00 days_later was much more helpful and did in fact leave the car as close to the arrivals area as he could .
positive	i got nearly as many free items as i purchased .
neutral	the reason i started_using approved food was because of my terrible financial_situation , so when i see how much i '_m supposed to be spending in postage_charges it really puts me off !

negative	them : " no the courier will phone or text you "
positive	i thought about it for months .
positive	i came_across this website and the description matched exactly_what i was looking for .
negative	this in no way reflects on the service received by the fitters at national - they were fantastic .

negative	faulty , damaged furniture , wrong products
positive	sleek , trendy , cool , smart , cost friendly and great to deal with .

negative	i felt that he could have at_least asked me to rebuild them and he would make_sure the orders were dispatched on time or he could have offered a discount but nothing , just rudeness .
neutral	i '_m_sure this will be addressed at some time but it '_s a bit of a pain and needs some joined up thinking .
neutral	it all seemed to be going so well .
negative	this didn_'_t stop asos from calling me a cheat , liar and a thief .
positive	the rose basket was very impressive and unusual coloured roses and fresh looking flowers were perfect .
negative	completely_unhelpful line staff and managers - i wouldn_'_t recommend this lot to anyone .
neutral	considering the day permit for the loch was £ 0 , this isn_'_t worth £_00 .
negative	no refund yet .
positive	mazuma_mobile was so easy to use .
neutral	0 .
neutral	hired a mercedes e_- class - for a special_occasion - good that it was a 00 plate - 0 areas of damage worthy of note not so good - car had been given a quick wash down and water drying marks were still evident - wheels had been given a quick wash over and were left dirty in all the nooks and crannies - tyres were left dirty .
positive	however with pest_control supplies it was first_class .
negative	al markedsføring er ren trick - bl . a .

neutral	package came quickly enough but the box was too small , the mask was crammed in and scratched a little , item was returned due to a change of plan , but still was unhappy with the delivery condition
neutral	being a bit of an old fogie i prefer stability in my service providers .
negative	they would not give me my money back or let it be used towards another group on ( as some other_companies do ) they may as well have robbed me as they have my money for nothing at all .
negative	tried to place an order which was cancelled then tried again thinking it was just a glitch and again order cancelled .
positive	my advice would be go for it you have nothing to lose
negative	the meds i order are £_00 a month and are life saving .
neutral	once you have been done there are no signs to the terminal_building so you end up going through what looks like an office block to find the terminal - all in all - long_winded , stressful and you are left late !
negative	i took a day off work to be at home for the delivery and they then turned_up with the wrong cooker .
negative	this is the response from the advertising_standards authority who just walk_away like shiply - if you use shiply ever read every item on the website and be aware that the cowboy couriers who use their site can cancel your job at any time , walk_away , and it costs them nothing but it costs you bigtime .

positive	it also matched my stainless cooker which i was planning to fit it below .
positive	i could pay through paypal which is always a bonus , both in terms of ease of use and being_able to trust them .
neutral	!
neutral	i returned the item and was sent a refund by return of post .
positive	i have been using amazon for years . usually the cheapest on the net for most things , quick to dispatch and always keep you updated on your orders . the free delivery service is a big plus if you don_'_t mind waiting a couple of days extra for your items .
positive	i bought a topgun dress from escapade to wear to a fancy_dress_party a couple of weeks_ago !
negative	i had to agree to this as the guy stated there was no other option .
negative	?
neutral	you will probably spend a lot less_than $_00 dollar in a week but you will need exact change ( usually between about 00c and $ 0 ) at any tolls that are not staffed .
positive	its nice to see a company that puts the needs of peoples pets before their costs , which also helps those of us who have to look after every_penny we have .

negative	chimp electronics did eventually reply_saying they '_ve sent the replacement pair but will send out another pair this was 0_days ago and i '_m still_waiting and i reckon i never will see a working pair of headphones or see my money .
negative	terrible site and an_absolute waste of time .
negative	when i bought the two bed side_tables i was told that if it is damaged then they will replace it only to be told we will repair it so i paid full price for damaged goods .
neutral	i waited on hold for an_eternity and this is somthing that really needs to improve .
negative	if i accept their offer it will cost me £ 0 to send the bracket back .
neutral	cartridges ok but took over a week to be delivered !
positive	can definitely recommend this company for their professionalism and customer service .
positive	a quick and speedy delivery it does what it says in the advert a good family run bussisness with puzzles to suit all tastes
neutral	hi , i booked a 0 day delivery , so it would be delivered on monday as the recipient was home all day .
positive	good effort .
negative	it is now 0 months since delivery .
negative	unfortunately , due to us regulations , you can '_t have the fake review removed by the site owner and they don_'_t seem to care about it anyway .
neutral	the bouquet looked sparser .
negative	believe me , they wont be contacting you .
negative	having waited 0_weeks i still have no footmuff for our pram and will have to buy one elsewhere .
neutral	when they did do the work , they sat in the car without_any seat protectors and left grease on the steering_wheel - this matched the grease hand print on the wing !

positive	hi i recently formed a company on behalf of a client using ukplc . com .
negative	she couldn_'_t help but said she would put a fast track on our email to try sort it out .
neutral	word of mouth is good enough , we all know what the sites are we don_'_t need to pay to contact them or receive a million text '_s , e_- mails and calls from " company '_s that can help " so go direct to them .
positive	the text_messages gave_me the assurance that the flowers had not only been dispatched on time , but had arrived .

negative	ive read .
positive	i purchased a couple of bamboo '_s from here a couple of years_ago , i went to this company because they sell such a wide_range of bamboo plants .
neutral	while the product remains good , i would urge the company to improve communication with buyers and to notify of dispatch , with parcel tracking_information .

negative	i sent my perfectly working iphone_0s 00gb in white , lock to o0 to bozowi .

positive	i like the choices i have while shopping here .
neutral	the deal that was offered represented good value .
negative	thinking i had got it wrong i said so the problem was with the store not the vehicle .
negative	the alternatives which would take a couple of days afterwards were in lower quality and they couldn_'_t offer any better mattress .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again .
neutral	to top it all they have stopped letting you ' redeem your money ' to paypal and only offer limited other options , a complete let_down .
positive	" brilliant " is not an_understatement .
neutral	driver was there when we got there , but had trouble trying to drive my automatic car .
negative	i bought an item which they showed as available .
negative	they simply told me to return the item to them .
negative	its obvious that they are only interested in making money for their shareholders and have no morales .
positive	easy website to use , product arrived quickly and was of a high_quality , arrived in great condition
negative	so when i decided to move home i checked the cost of cancelling my contract £_000 . 00 not the kind of money most people have to throw_away .
neutral	i called that as did our hotel concierge and still no response .
negative	!
positive	described as a value product and it most definitely was price_wise , performance wise no_complaints and its already been put to the test !
neutral	in my mind i had an image of a graceful bouquet full of scented lilies , roses and other gently coloured flowers .
negative	they said we weren_'_t there and i begged to differ .
neutral	barcode check in at tower_bridge worked well when we had identified the proper bus operators staff .
neutral	on the first occasion the order was promptly dispatched and the quality good at the price .
negative	as i had two refunds i rang up to check that the third item was being delivered as it was marked as dispatched .
positive	paced my order and i received it within 00_hrs

neutral	i wonder what will happen ?
positive	all in all a brilliant experience from beginning to end product .
neutral	cheap get aways . thanks

negative	like so many of you , i ordered my bigboy beanbag as a xmas_present for my kids .
negative	i '_ve now managed to get most of the settings working myself and today tried to get a bit of final telephone help .
neutral	i feel as though the frontline customer_care let olotels down .
neutral	however , the box itself said it was the ordinary ( non - collapsible ) model , and indeed that is what the box contained .
neutral	we told the guy but he wasn_'_t bothered .
positive	by mid_afternoon the promised money was in my account .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for any sort of refund .
positive	i bought a cheeseboard which was personalised to give as a house_warming present .
negative	i asked for an explanation as to how a holiday_inn in one of the worst areas in london is a 0_* top_secret_hotel only to be told these ratings are from a person from lastminute who goes to the hotel .
positive	great service !.
neutral	nan did not know they were from me .
neutral	ironically travel_nation staff still deserve to be complimented on their communication_skills since they managed to prevent me from losing all my patience for so long .
positive	items ordered were the cheapest i found on the internet .
positive	my son will love his christmas_present i am sure .
negative	web sales grow on customers confidence , as a previous customer to bed room pleasures , i certainly won_'_t be using again a
negative	i got an_email from them today saying they were out of stock .
neutral	i find this rather stupid .
positive	price was better_than any i was quoted as well .
neutral	i was not that happy with the flowers at all .
positive	some friends recommended vertigo .
neutral	meanwhile i will probably go and buy some of the same product from boots .
neutral	this experience will not stop me from using them again but i will probably phone unless the website is very clear about availability and delivery
negative	i will never use them again .
neutral	one niggle - we were told by the salesman that they only had one sale per year and that we were getting a bargain !
neutral	besides - for other bookings with them that are " off airport " in the past - they are very specific about where to go to collect the car ( even_though on occasion this has_been wrong ).
neutral	my email with proof of identity sat in his inbox for a week before i chased for a response so that the paperwork could be issued to me - this then seemed to take a while - and then an_error in signing the paperwork ( on my part ) meant that i had another 0 day wait before the " cooling_off period " could start .
neutral	next_day on all other orders but the last one had to chase up
positive	after a thorough_search , watch supermarket had the lowest_price for the watch i wanted .
negative	i was once an_avid customer of maplin , but i then realised many of the products i had purchased from them were just not giving a good life span .
neutral	the cross however was beautiful .
negative	i am sorry for this .
neutral	as the item has_been sent from europe first and the first_class delivery only occurs once it is in the uk !
positive	we found the web_site very informative which made ordering the underfloor_heating easy to do .
negative	they told there was nothing they could do and they could not even match the price of the flights .
negative	left empty_handed .
neutral	just eat is okay if you know what food place you want to order from .
negative	i had no voicemails on either my mobile or my house phone .
positive	wouldnt_hesitate to recomend .
negative	avoid .
positive	the website is one of the best laid_out i '_ve seen .
negative	then suggested i go to my local_store at my own cost to get a new one .
negative	ordered an item on the 0th of jan for my girlfriends_birthday on the 00th , i thought this would be sufficient time for an item to arrive .
neutral	the night before collection , we used online facility to extend the rental_period and request a collection earlier in the day .
negative	still nothing !
positive	people shouldn_'_t think that couriers are any more_expensive than regular post because they are which you would expect .
neutral	however , since the new flexi ticket was introduced late last_year , and despite always choosing this option , we were very disappointed to be denied vip on our last return from dover even_though , when we got on board and the purser let us into the lounge , we counted only 00 passengers in there .
neutral	merry_christmas
neutral	i wrote and let them know i was not happy and they sent me a free_postage_label to return what i did not want .
negative	they kept my phone for 0_weeks when they promise to repair in one day .
negative	i immediately contacted iflorist and spoke to a customer_services rep , who could provide no explanation , no satisfactory solution to the problem .
positive	the fuel we pay for a small car is outrageous and really pushes the price up so if you have any say in this , please , please try to stop the car_rentals from charging so much .
negative	it is a criminal offence to falsify documentation .
neutral	probably_won_'_t use cardtown again
negative	amazing .

negative	i am now minus a holiday come 00th_december , i am taking this to the highest extreme to get this company closed_down . beware . scammers
positive	i was a bit_skeptical because my friend had warned me about buying an id online that theres lots of scams . but i thought_id give it a try and im sooo glad i did , it only took 0_days to arrive .
neutral	firstly can i say the lights , accessories etc .
negative	they then offered £_00 compensation for a £_000 item !
neutral	the tea and coffee was very welcome but nothing for children .
neutral	kept telling_me there were " server problems ".
positive	many_thanks
negative	i was simply told we '_d have to wait our turn in the ' queue ' and that there were obviously a high number of referrals that have been passed over that day .
neutral	it could also be made clearer which outlets provide cashback - many seem to be for on - line purchases and it appears that numerous stores provide this function on - line , but not for actual shopping in store .
negative	on the phone i was told by a rude lady that i couldn_'_t do this and would have to fill in a form online .
negative	we got a bat onesie from there for halloween and it was amazing and much_cheaper_than joker '_s .
neutral	i can '_t say who the fault lies with ( probably not with animed '_s dispatch in fairness ) but a budget delivery company gives budget results .
positive	golfgarb are great , i bought two items from them because their price was most competetive and the speed of shipping was fantastic .

positive	my sister rang me to tell me how lovely they were but not leaving close by i haven_'_t been able to judge personally .
negative	i duly ordered and paid and rearranged my day accordingly .
positive	would not_hesitate to recommend !
positive	it is easy to download and quick to install .
neutral	issues only began when the parcel courier used couldn_'_t deliver on a saturday ( even if i paid_extra ) or after 0pm ( i get home from work around 0 : 00 !).
positive	i '_m_sure i '_ve created a whole new customer base in sydney from myself alone .
neutral	we departed the bus on kensington high_street .
negative	i rang up again an_hour later and spoke to a different member of staff .
negative	having sold some things on ebay i thought that would try to send one of them by collect_+.
neutral	competitive price and promptly delivered but was disappointed to find the bookshelf bracket strips were slightly_bent and 0 of the 0 were scratched .
negative	yodel tracker ;
neutral	not good as this has cost me £ 0 . 00 so far so not very happy at the moment .

positive	so yes - read the reviews and especially look for the latest ones as places and people do change over time .
neutral	didnt have time to send back , so just used it with problems .
positive	will definitely be using kezie whenever we ' re planning events .
positive	what can i say , i applied online ( monday ), got a bag well a small box ( wednesday ) posted on ( thursday ) and about 00_hours_later ( friday ) money was put in my account i was blown_away by the services , contact and all_round ease of selling my old_phones .
neutral	battery arrived in four days and is ok and does the job .
positive	they even took away the packaging we no_longer required .

positive	our furniture arrived exactly when promised and is much to our liking .
neutral	another issues where we found was unnecessary was the cost of postage .
positive	kind_regards , paul .
positive	i would definitely buy from eflorist again .
negative	i bought these tickets as part of my daughter '_s christmas and now she isn_'_t getting to go and i am very out of pocket !
neutral	the day i needed to change flights , it actually ended_up being less expensive to just not show up at the airport and book new flights by myself , rather_than requesting travel_nation to change them .
positive	great service from golfbase .
neutral	i actually questioned whether bbw was closing_down !!
neutral	emailed back saying hope this was a typo and was meant 00th_january as didn_'_t really want to wait 00 months for my order .
negative	i did like using wowcher but after the service i have experienced i will not be using it again

positive	will_definitely order from wiggle again .
negative	customer service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
neutral	having to enter the code off the post_office reciept into the web account before the refund would be actioned was not good .
positive	will use this supplier again .

positive	i can '_t speak too highly of them .
neutral	luckily once the the service was quick and efficient and a nice clean car waiting for us .
negative	having navigated to a co . uk site , i instantly assumed that my order would be processed and desptached from the uk .
neutral	my order took several weeks to arrive but credit_card debited_immediately - shame

negative	they seem to have stopped now , as i asked for my account to be closed .
neutral	i would say that there was £_00 - ish worth of meat in the hamper rather_than £_000 so you get what you pay for rather_than the hamper being half price ( we are beef farmers and i am used to good quality beef and know what you have to pay for it !).
positive	it ’_s just about to get its first try out on a ceramic floor .
negative	do not touch this company .

neutral	texts sent to let_me know that my flowers had been dispatched and had arrived .

negative	they completely_ignored the fact that money had been taken and i had not received a voucher !
negative	the website says it takes 00 days to moscow and customer_services have told me that once it leaves the uk there is nothing they can do to find my parcel and i have to contact the russian postal service myself .
positive	on arrival very straightforward with regular buses to airport .
neutral	the blinds are well made , it '_s just the mechanics of the bar showing through , which spoil the look .
positive	i was out and the delivery company came out again the next_day withoutany effort from me .
negative	from very dissatisfied mum ,
negative	this company is in beach of contract , and , under contract laws , i am now entitled to a refund and compensation ; i will pursue this and take to the small_claims court if_necessary - then they will end up having to pay costs as well as possible a higher compensation amount .
positive	finally the tips for a successful installation a really good idea

negative	when i finally got to speak to technical_support they laughed at the customer support and then told me they haven_'_t done any of the internal tests they said they were doing .
negative	i wrote to them on 00 . 00 . 00 explaining all this .

neutral	apart_from issues picking_up parcels a decent easy to use service .
negative	they would not do anything so i complained to the manufacturer who replaced the panels .
negative	manager as useful as a chocolate_teapot .
positive	i would not_hesitate to recommend them to anybody !
negative	rooms over_£_00 include and english_breakfast served at the duke william and car_parking is available @ £ 0 for 00_hours .
positive	the whole_process was so clear and easy to use .
negative	they are not a real car parking company and are not supported_by any organisations that regulates car parking .
positive	great service .
neutral	so the saga_continues .
positive	the service was great couldn_'_t really fault it .
negative	in the end we had to get the coach home .
neutral	replacements were sent straight_away .
positive	first time i had ordered from viovet and certainly not the last .
negative	!
positive	all sizes .
negative	i '_m_sure they ' re fine if it all works , but we had a pretty expensive and shoddy experience .
positive	arrived in a blink of an eye .
positive	you have my opinion above .
negative	the only_reason i got o0 in first place was shawn bean .
neutral	its not so bad , when you , think britain , is known as rip_off , capital of europe .
positive	picked it up off their d0t which offered it at a better price than its competitors .
neutral	the only_thing i would say is that there was a mistake in your catalogue where under the wooden guitar puzzle , it had the piano code instead .
negative	the amount of time we spent on the phone to this sad excuse of a company i should have just paid the £_000_pound each they wanted for new tickets .
neutral	i was intending on booking 0 night in a hostel in a dorm room and then 0 night in a private_room at the same hostel the following night .
neutral	same as for dvds .
positive	it is a fantastic item .
neutral	kind_regards ,
positive	a word of warning , should a pimper find a crack in our blinds we ' re both coming up to 00 years old and the veiw could put them off sex for life
positive	i got what i wanted at a lower price than where i do my grocery_shopping .
negative	it has taken seven weeks to get a refund from them during which time i have sent innumerable e_- mails , telephoned and hand to stand the interest charges on my credit_card .
negative	i went off on holiday little realising that i should have sent a voucher directly to the company .
negative	which i '_d already given them .
negative	categorically no attempt was made and no card was left !!
positive	i would truly recommend using this company .
negative	bit of advice - invest in some proper training for your staff !
neutral	this was not disclosed ' in the interests of security '.
negative	0pm arrives .
positive	.
neutral	one thing i will be watching out for is the charge on my credit_card .
negative	0_days before the event i received an e_- mail advising the seller couldn_'_t provide the tickets .
positive	i thought cdi , meant a button start .
positive	i would recommend to anyone .
positive	i know when to expect deliveries and trust their quality .
positive	order processed and delivered next_day .
neutral	i sent it back for a refund but apparently they never received it ???
negative	scary staff they know everything about you !!
positive	0 * service indeed .
negative	received terrible service was given the run around for 0_weeks , i was told my items were in stock then when i still didn_'_t have them 0_weeks_later they said they are out of stock and can '_t deliver anyway cause the vans not in my area bearing in mind they had already taken £_000 out of my account !
neutral	we got there in the end . after a couple of early communication hiccups .
positive	i ordered a brush_set from crown which came with super_fast delivery .
positive	product arrived within two_days of ordering .
neutral	i have ordered monday_morning and friday is the due delivery date .
neutral	super pour_les_délais_de_livraison trés rapide mais j ' ai_du payer des frais_de douanes
neutral	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
neutral	the game description says instant delivery of the key - not true .
neutral	neither when the wrong fabric was delivered , or the right one , was i sent an_email to tell me the order had been dispatched - pure_luck i was in each time .
neutral	still keep_coming_back and is alot_cheaper_than some of the other_sites and dont_bother buying in retail_stores .
neutral	very disappointed !
negative	additionally neither will house numbers help . as they jump from 00 - to - 00 i had a moment of anxiety that i '_d booked a scammers b_& b !
negative	-.
positive	will_certainly be making use of cjs_cd_keys again , it '_s a piece of cake to order and get your key and the prices are a bargain .
negative	we decided to sleep on it .
neutral	he will not move for the customer , he wold rather run you over or wait all day until you move for him .
positive	i got the second smallest_size and really good size .
neutral	but i was charged extra for fitting as i was a long way away , but as fortune would have it i had to travel north on business so arranged to meet fitter and have job_done near oxford instead of ramsgate , kent .
neutral	who on earth would send a christening invite out a year in_advance ?
negative	!
negative	this has happened to another order of ours again !!!
negative	how disappointing to receive broken toy specially paid for to be delivered by christmas .
negative	which basically means they left my goods on full_view for anyone to see and remove !!
neutral	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
neutral	in my opinion efficiency needs to imrove .
negative	i needed this parcel as i '_m going on holiday tomorrow morning .
positive	can not fault it .
neutral	so to rate furniture_market ;
neutral	when i booked on line i did not note any reference to the fact that your office was not at the air port , and was a long trip from the airport on a very over crowered bus
positive	the medium / long collar arrived within three_days and having used it on two seven hour aeroplane flights i can state categorically that the product is top quality , both in comfort and quality of finish .
positive	thank_you for your time and trouble .
neutral	i bought a phone neat xmas from the o0 shop in scunthorpe , and it was a nokia , only cost me about £_00 .
neutral	should have been better getting them from a market
negative	as i write this , i am looking at their website , specifically our product and i see ' mrs x just bought this product ' and ' 00 people are viewing this product at the moment ' and i wish i could reach out to each and every one of them individually and tell them to run screaming in the opposite_direction .
positive	i would use this site again to order pet_food .
negative	after several phone_calls , they claimed that they never received the form and asked for a copy which was sent recorded delivery .
negative	refuse delivery , courier takes phone away .
positive	top_drawer .
neutral	all that said the goods came early and were fine , i do wonder what would have happened had there been an_error ?
negative	to get this zorted onceandfor all , he wouldn_'_t sorry , said he could not put me through , i then asked to speak to someone more senior and he said customer zervices were not available , i then asked him to get customer ssrvices to call me back and hesaid they didn_'_t make call_backs , b ut , as you can see from tuesday 00rd_april they do .
positive	i bought these biblongs online , normally i would buy on .
negative	my order with viovet went very smoothly .
positive	i tend to forget to ask to be parked by the lift . due to a disability .
neutral	flowers not as_described realise its the busy_period ( xmas ) but was not happy with them at all however customer service i cannot_fault at all and was offered a refund or new flowers straight_away - would not put me off using again just not at busy_periods !
neutral	i found the staff to be a bit off with me .
negative	do not order from wally '_s gifts if you expect to get the item you paid for .
positive	the only_thing is the hat has a brown stain on it which makes the item look used but due to my ordering it and needing it immediately i don_'_t have time to return it before wearing it .
positive	i would definitely use e_- careers again .
positive	great price , great service .
negative	the worst customer service ever !
negative	company did agree to a short_term credit_note to exchange the easy plumb kit but seeing as they do not have much to exchange for having purchased everything else i needed am a bit stuck and credit will only last a couple of weeks provided i can get it back to the warehouse within a deadline .
negative	the tiles i order was of poor quality wrong_colour which if that wasn_'_t bad enough the after sale was even worse and rude and un help full making this something i never started and made me not order of a website again
negative	it has not arrived .
positive	i can highly_recommend appliances_online . com
negative	!
positive	got my order next_day and delivery was free , great service especially when you need something quick to help an animal .
neutral	not quite as it should be , the screws in the extension flap did not quite fit into the holes on the extension bars .
negative	even then some flowers were dying and no food in the package .
neutral	but i did ask for some nutritional advise but received no response .
negative	sorry but thatwas the reason i chose this company , cheque still notarrived after 00 days called again at my expense - no one in accounts and there has_been a problem with some cheques - you may have to wait another 00 days !!!!!!!
positive	i am so impressed with the costume and the service received .
positive	impeccable service with a real concern for customer_satisfaction , i especially like the fact they ask for the date of your party as it shows how much they value their customers .
negative	the reply was they cannot log a complaint or close my account as the customer_services is now closed , as this is the breakdown service .
negative	i demanded our money back , but stoneacre said it was their policy to try and fix it first .
neutral	i ordered my girlfriend flowers to be delivered to her work on valentines_day , the flowers arrived and are gorgeous and she_loved them .
positive	attached and i received an email the next_morning to say they have identified my required keys and provided me with the relevant links saying if they did not fit then i can have a refund .
neutral	delivery and information was very good . sister was thrilled with bouquet but the flowers only lasted three day then the roses turned brown and the other flowers started to wilt .
neutral	for about £_000 you can get yourself a tuxedo which is alright considering it is between £_00 and £_00 to hire .
neutral	i found the product easy to use and the effect not immediate i notice the pain in my ankle less pain
negative	only later did i discover , however , that he didn_'_t note the return of the phone on his system , meaning that when , in the o0 shop , they tried to sort me out a very favourable deal because of the trouble i ' d had next door , they couldn_'_t .
neutral	- you do not get any type of information booklet with your first order .
neutral	i was disappointed to receive a geographical puzzle with an_error in it ( 0 counties in wales mixed up ).
positive	the finish and overall expectancy of the produce is excellent and for once it came packaged as though someone actually cared if it got to its_destination in peak condition .
negative	they replied to the complaint addressing me by the previous_owners name and didn_'_t address any of my questions .
neutral	considering you told me i would have my voucher_code emailed to me on the 00th and i still_haven_'_t received it to be able to redeem my item . not very good .
neutral	i have two gripes though :
negative	customer service began shouting and abusive stating it was my own fault .
positive	a range of delivery options to suit all_budgets and timescales too .
neutral	needs to be supplied with stand - off brackets for the rad .
negative	i emailed them again a few_days ago asking for a refund and they have not replied .
neutral	on top of that the postage was underpaid so i has to pay the 00p shortage plus a £ 0 fee .
negative	if you think that is great then blimey :-)
positive	great , fast service .
negative	also emailed this company and had no response at all .
neutral	however the true level of customer service cannot be fully assessed until after i have received my ticket and fly to my holiday destination and back .
negative	their call_centre is so noisy you can hardly hear_anything .
positive	i had be searcking for this connector for some time and could not find one of the quality i wanted ; now i have
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of running leggings , i got the order confirmation etc .
neutral	after lots of schpiel about why it will save me money , and having said ok , thanks , i was halfway_through having the paperwork drawn up before the chap had the decency to tell me that this would set me back £_00 admin_fee .
positive	good price easy to use . you get your own bespoke_design
positive	i would definitely use this company again .
positive	excellent service , good communication kept me it touch with every_aspect of my purchase , and last but not least excellent value will use this company again and again
neutral	so not an amazing experience but i hate paying the crazy prices that lexmark are asking .
positive	returns re a sizing issue in the past were handled_superbly .
negative	use them at your_peril !!
negative	i have family in italy and it is cheaper for me to travel indirect ( via london )
negative	do not use parcel_force please
positive	along with their incredible proficient service i would ceretainly use again .
neutral	i received my sweet trooper helmet quickly after ordering it , which was much_appreciated .
neutral	not so much due to yourselves but the 0rd_party , and the process can be confusing .
negative	seems the best way to go .
positive	i am now assured that it will arrive within 00_hours , so smiles all_round !
positive	easy purchase , good communications and fast delivery in_spite of very bad road conditions !
positive	i always order from animed as their prices are very reasonable and of course the postage and packing is free .
positive	will use the service again when we '_ve worked our way through the 00 bottles .
positive	and their delivery times are one of the best around
positive	great service .
positive	i would use this company again .
neutral	i '_m sorry to say that my products still have not arrived 0_weeks after order and paying for 0 - 0 working day delivery .
neutral	the starlings in my garden are still managing to get a beakful
neutral	i complained to customer service who said they '_ll ask their couriers to be more careful in future !
negative	it has left 0 reviews online that are both fake .
negative	from greece , the questions were cheaper to ask via_email than telephone .
negative	well . the manager did .
neutral	i have made it a bit more comfortable by trimming out a piece on the velcro but this isn_'_t a comfortable fit .
neutral	unfortunately when i did contact them , they were totally_useless - obviously reading from a script .
positive	i was able to send flowers while on holiday - it was so easy !
positive	i got my jeans delivered in less_than 0 days .
positive	+++++++++++++++++++++++++
negative	i will never use sky again
negative	breakfast was well cooked .- well_done chef !
positive	they gave_me a call a few_days after i had received the parts to check that i was happy and continued to help me and answer any questions that i had .
neutral	all in all i would use oak furnture land again as the quality of the product is very good and the staff very helplful .
neutral	i am very pleased with the price but the booking experience left me concerned whether everything will go to plan at the airport .
positive	great site
neutral	i '_m always on a tight_schedule with my work and i have never found a garage that understands this , even on that one and only service i didn_'_t get the car back at the alloted_time because they didn_'_t have an oil_filter for it in stock !!!!!
neutral	this is over half the price .
neutral	which spoilt the surprise .
positive	picked my delivery date , everything arrived on time , as_described and packaged excellent .
negative	and guess_what it had not been collected .
negative	beware .
negative	they then even got a hammer and tried hammering my wheel off .
positive	we were really pleased with the nets and the service we received and we would definitely recommend your company to friends and family .
negative	orginal order took to long 0months to be exact
positive	loads of frames to choose from .
positive	the orders arrive quickly and neatly , the site is easy to navigate and the prices are really competitive .
positive	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
positive	frank answered all my questions and sent me the tracking_details for my parcel which arrived very quickly and great care had been taken in the packaging so in excellent condition .
neutral	it really doesnt cost £ 0 . 00 to post a small trophy !
negative	i have ordered bags before and had no_issues but recently ordered small paper_bags for a specific purpose .
negative	their customer service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
neutral	good priced product but was given a delivery schedule , waited all day but did ' nt show , text me next_day but i had to delay to day after , i think it was delivery firms fault
positive	easy , efficient , straighforward and very expedient
negative	initially i was told this amount would change at midnight - which surprise_surprise did not .
negative	either that or they did not understand because they are based in spain .
positive	brilliant service and fast delivery
positive	i won_'_t be buying glasses any where else
positive	we now await the results !
neutral	they told me that they would call us the day before .
neutral	i had to use an additional credit_card to put up a bond of 0000 euros to pre_- cover for the cdw excess .
positive	could not have been any quicker .
negative	0 .
positive	barbs
positive	a very straight_forward , easy to navigate web_site .
neutral	i would rather of known this before i purchased as its a faff to get them all out of the packs , and hard to see how many approx are left as i usually see how many are left in the pot .
positive	as far as i am concerned i would use this company again .
negative	i asked if i could cancel the order and was told that was fine , but i probably would not be able to get it elsewhere any quicker .
negative	received pelvic toner 0_days after i ordered it .
neutral	received only one despite having paid for two .
negative	i am now pursuing them through my bank and most_likely will go through small_claims .
negative	it seems that the money is managed by worldpay and may still be " stuck in the system ".
negative	i am very disappointed .
positive	quality is great and delivery fast too .
positive	they carry the full range of my favourite bass_strings ( d ' addario ) and i can build a custom set as they sell single strings too .
positive	i have used these to send out to customers and i am sure they will be just as impressed as we were .
positive	good price and quick delivery .
neutral	surely the dispatcher should realise that these are relatively sensitive pieces of electronics and require to be packed adequately .
negative	i tried to review the gate fixings on their website to point out they are not sent with instructions , despite them saying they are .
neutral	replacements are , i '_m told , on the way and should be here in 00_hours time .
negative	do not , do not under any circumstances order a phone from carphone_warehouse on line or by telephone .
neutral	i bought 0 electrics as i call them i put them on to charge up and 0 of them would not work so i willnot get anymore thank_you .
neutral	they were sent to me in less 00 days and the glasses are great .
neutral	package did not arrive for 0 . 0_weeks .
positive	i would recommend this company and will be using them again if we need more usb_drives .
neutral	i gave it to my more normal sized son .
negative	i have sent numerous_emails to the store and their head_office and i have had not even 0 word back from them . shocking .
neutral	so fare so good was accepted on 00 / 00 /_0000 not had my first payment go out yet but if they say i will be deat free in 0 years by paying £_000 a month for £ 00000 that '_s got to be good .
negative	they have been no problem .
neutral	purchased pure evoke 0s digital_radio with an apparent fault when unit switched on .
negative	very disappointed .
positive	will use this company again .
neutral	bought these shoes for a christmas_present for my step mum .
negative	after talking to a representative for around half an_hour , absolutely nothing was sorted_out , " at_least two more weeks " was all i was told , and i have asked them to cancel my order .
positive	would recommend your florist to everyone .
neutral	what a shame this company feel the need to spoil an excellent online ordering and delivery service with ham - fisted arrogant and insulting attempts to sell you their extra_insurance_cover .
neutral	when my plumber realised that the legs weren_'_t included , i contacted betterbathrooms and asked where they were .
negative	and given all their orders are sent from us , then there is possibility of custom fraud .
negative	0_weeks ) to deliver , but the price was very good and i wasn_'_t in a hurry .
negative	do yourself a favour and order elsewhere .
negative	on return our car has obviously been involved in a minor incident , leading to two alloys being scratched and a type being_ripped apart .
negative	it my first time using john_lewis online . i won_'_t be using them again .
positive	the flowers were absoutely beautiful - much_better_than i had hooped for and they were delivered very promptly - i would most definitely recommend them and will use again
neutral	my only issue is having received my order for two 0gb of paired ram one of the modules was faulty .
neutral	i do feel that as there was a problem and i had not responded to the email , then surely a follow_up phone_call should have been actioned .
negative	our order did not arrive on the day after we ordered it as we expected .
positive	i find the cewe site easy and quick to use .
negative	i have only been with scottish_power for 0_months and have never in my life known anything like it .
positive	would ' work '.
neutral	it required another person to hold in place whilst attaching to the velux_window frame .
neutral	would be good if you could book cheap parking with less_than 00_hours notice
positive	the turnaround from ordering to appearing at my door was 0 days .
negative	had my money soon enough though !
negative	this resulted_in the whiskas containers being smashed into tiny shards & the contents to granules , not to mention the amount of cleaning up i was left to do !
neutral	not all fixings were included in box , so because it was a bank_holiday we improvised and cut the fixings down .
neutral	in fact , with more extensive ' googling ' i later found a similar but better deal ( 0m of same cables instead of 0m ) £_00 cheaper .
negative	i sent them several emails but all replies were vague and unhelpful .
neutral	i complained about this , and they assured me that they would all be updated as ex - demonstrators on their web_site .
positive	i ordered a saw blade , and the service i got was fantastic .
negative	i am thoroughly disappointed .
negative	i '_ve demanded my money back in full via_email , and i guess will just have to wait and see if they are honest enough to admit that they '_ve made a massive mistake and will give all these angry customers a refund .
positive	found someone that took my rather old phone .
positive	both were excellent value for money and both accurately_described .
positive	a really good company who offer fair returns for goods bought .
positive	so far the samsung laser_printer ordered seems good .
positive	the dresser is all i had hoped for , and more .
positive	thank_you .
positive	the vet said she had arthritis and recommend she take yumove .
negative	i was charged in chinese yen , then incurred bank charges and different currency rate , then charged import_duty of £_00 .
negative	we are talking_about failure to deliver the goods on time .
negative	i then find out that i have to pay the return postage which cost me £ 0 . 00 !.
neutral	so , actually i picked_up the car at 00 : 00
negative	i ordered the o ring seals kit for a bristan mixer shower .
positive	i would recommend this to all my friends , easy , reliable and easy to contact .
positive	i am delighted with them .
positive	very easy to use to find the right sunglasses .
positive	i had a handset which i knew was probably worth selling , envirofone offered the best price and it was easy to enter the model into the website , select the method i would like to receive my payment and then sit back and wait !
negative	they then took over a month to even acknowledge that they had the order even_though it was couriered in , which i find strange given the order would have been with them the same day it was sent .
positive	we have worked with steven on several_occasions and each time he never_fails to deliver on his promises and always makes us feel_valued as a customer .
neutral	i really wish it came with new pins and a tool or instructions how to put it together .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	the following_day we received a phone_call saying delivery would be between 0 and 0 and someone would ring 00_minutes before delivery sunday_afternoon arrived and along came a white_van which turned_out to be our delivery .
neutral	to date i have still not had an acknowledgement of the email or a responce .
neutral	finger crossed .
neutral	i think it is short_sighted and archaic that any company let_alone a trade supplier , especially online - would only deliver to the cardholder '_s address .
negative	i emailed a complaint to the email address they had given me and i am yet to receive a reply over a week_later .
negative	i then had them transfer some monies to it .
negative	not trustworthy .
neutral	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it '_s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
neutral	a couple days_later it came , but the bag one of the pairs was in was opened and the other was not which suggest to me the opened one could have been tried on by someone_else before he sent it back .
positive	having placed my order a spare frame was sent through the post ( free to keep ) to wear whilst taking a photo of my head to send off to them to enable my eye pupil_distance to be correctly sized .
positive	about arrival was excellent including from call from delivery men .
neutral	also to be fair , they dealt_with my order immediately .
positive	i ordered my latest lenses at 0pm on the friday - they were here next_morning !
positive	kept well informed on the progress of the order and been able to track order was nice .
positive	ordered over the telephone in the morning of monday , 00th_sept_0000 and received the item before 0 . 00 pm the next_day .
positive	thank_you .
negative	received an email yesterday informing_me that the parcel was at thier depot in birmingham along with the usual lame_excuse about the weather .
neutral	i had to carry 00sq metres of tiles in by myself i am 00 years old and 0ft_tall .
positive	reasonable_price
negative	i have seen better flowers being discarded not delivered as a funeral tribute .
positive	the price was reasonable , probably the same or slighlty less_than i could have achieved selling_privately via somewhere like ebay but it was so much_easier .
neutral	everything was going great until website used parcelforce for postage . same thing again parcelforce left a signed for parcel with someone_who is not a neighbour and had to wait 0 more days until i managed to find person_who had signed for it , i thought signed for was for personal only ?
positive	both_times goods ordered were delivered on time and good value .
negative	but until i do , i will be doing my upmost to warn consumers of this company '_s shoddy - and dangerous - approach to business .
neutral	i also felt that some of the pictures looked over - processed .
negative	the irony is that another fridge_freezer was offered for delivery after this .
neutral	on the plus_side however , the site itself is user_friendly , easy to navigate , and easy to reserve items for later pick_up in stores .
positive	excellent i ordered a watch_strap and it came the next_day .
neutral	requested appointment for the sunday , received call to say that sunday was fully booked and would monday am be ok , agreed as had no choice as car was my work vehicle , booked half day holiday then received a call saying that the tyre was not in stock and would an afternoon appointment be ok .
negative	00_minutes !
negative	considering how painful this has_been and after over 00_yrs of loyalty i decide to leave o0 !
positive	good company .
neutral	trouble is nespresso is my morning indulgence and i almost don_'_t want to run the risk of not having great coffee to start the day .
positive	would highly_recommend and will use again .
neutral	took me less_than 0 minutes to select and but the tyre online but over an_hour at the fitting_centre :-(
negative	wrote a poor review of one of the barstools online but it looks like it has_been removed as it isn_'_t there !
positive	their customer service is good when you make an equity , order or have an issue .
neutral	the order came as promised but took a week to come .
positive	duff arrived quickly and as promised .
neutral	i have lost out on 00 pound , i bought this phone and because the signal wasn_'_t working i bought a new phone ( just thought i had brought the wrong phone for my simcard ) as i have just been informed by you the phone was stolen hence_why it did not work , i do agree with this as i would hate to have my phone stolen and would hope someone would hand it in , but i bought this phone for 00 pound of somebody so not just the person_who '_s phone it is but also i have lost out , would appreciate it if i was the person_who '_s phone it was and will be having very strong words with who sold me the phone !!!
neutral	i ordered 0 coffee machines and only one arrived .
neutral	as i was not home , it was left with my neighbour , who i do not know , but who now knows that i am expecting since she saw exactly_what i had bought !
negative	the neighbours cats had obviously been at it as it was all ripped and the contents ( a £_000 motherboard ) was lying at the side of it , very wet and mouldy .
positive	robert e
negative	deres hjemmeside .
positive	fantastic company , first_rate from_start to finish .
positive	unlike_some other very much larger company , ( mentioning no names ).
negative	!
negative	unless stopped by you joe_public !
neutral	product fine , when it arrived .
neutral	nothing '_s fullproof and i '_m finding that i '_m having to do quite a bit of sidetracking to see if there might be trains running to places i want to go to at the times and dates that i require .
positive	happy customer , happy dog !
positive	even on a small order , i got my item quick and with a free_gift !
positive	yes .
neutral	the delivery was late , not left in the place requested and the ice_blocks had melted .
neutral	the company confirmed that i had not placed the order .
neutral	i was pleasantly_surprised that despite only placing the order in the afternoon , the item ( xmas_tree ) was delivered the following_day .
negative	?
neutral	however i left the car with a three quarter_tank and was charged e00 . 00 euro for fuel !!!!
positive	the website was very easy to navigate and place an order .
neutral	we '_ll see !
positive	quick and easy ordering of essentials with rapid delivery .
neutral	a pool_table is advertised but it is of very poor quality , the baize is too slack , the cues are unsuitable and the cover leaks .
positive	i ordered kitchen cabinet knobs one day and unbelievably they were delivered the very next_day !
positive	excellent fast service : delivery next_day .
neutral	we had a couple of pieces damaged but the customer service
positive	i got a mail saying i will receive a new mail with my tracking_number as soon as it will be in dispatched status .
positive	thanks .
negative	you have no interest in the customer and accurate representation of service .
positive	my experience and recommendation is that animed_direct ' does what it says on the the packet '!!!
neutral	i then had to phone the store the next_day to see if it had arrived which it had .
neutral	i still have heard_nothing even_though i emailed customer_services !
positive	will_definitely use them again .

neutral	i ordered 0 flashing tiaras , 0 arrived and was snapped with a gem missing .
negative	when i contacted customer_services they were curt and unhelpful in their reponses and kept asking me to call them on a number that does not work outside of germany .
neutral	the contact_lenses were a good price but there was a small problem with the order which_meant it took a while to arrive .
neutral	delivery was delayed on all orders which held up the project .
neutral	apart_from the delivery problems i was very pleased with the service and would consider_using this company again if they were to change their delivery policy !
negative	i rang up 0_days after i '_d ordered some items for holiday and i was going on holiday the following_day to be told that they were out for delivery that day .
neutral	i have upgraded my opinion of interparcel , because although their response to my non collection issues by hermes ( who should be avoided at all costs ), was slow and cost me my sale , eventually tried to rectify the situation .
negative	therefore based on 0 - 0_days delivery i should have my items , but i don_'_t .
negative	because this was missing from the pack i had to pay out £_00 of labour charges whilst he drove round various stores looking for an o ring to fit , and the best match found didnt work , so ive had to purchase a new cartridge now - from somewhere_else , as i dont want to risk being sent an incomplete item again from national_shower_spares .

neutral	not a fun experience on a hangover !
neutral	spend ended_up with £ 0 special fluids delivery charge . no explanation as to why .

positive	i had trouble_locating certain_aspects ( insured to drive between portugal & spain ) of my rental car on their website so i phoned directly to rental . com at 00 in the evening and in a matter of 0 minutes the deal was done and it was cheaper !!
neutral	to be fair they refunded me quickly and no_harm_done but my advice would be to check the good are actually being sold by amazon and not one of their partners .
neutral	ok so i loved sky go when it came out and the recording aspect .
negative	terrible service and a rude staff_member .
positive	very professional operators who get it right every time .
negative	very poor service and overlay charged to be put on hold and not dealt_with .

neutral	normally a good prompt service but was disappointed with the last delivery .
neutral	i had to keep chasing and eventually i contacted their delivery company myself - frustrating !
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , , i web chatted again ( now getting a bit angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised asked about the parcel contents and raised an even bigger flag to find the parcel .
neutral	the name says it all " plus ".
negative	you failed to get back to me with answers .
negative	when ( if ) it arrives in the uk it still needs to clear customs and i have a feeling that '_ll be a problem too .
negative	most of the other_companies at the airport had no queues at all !

negative	i was confused , as i did not request a movie and i found the option " rentals ( 0 )" where it clearly_displayed no movies in the list .
negative	big mistake on their part , i probably_won_'_t use this clothing company again whilst they continue to use yodel .
positive	wee done !
negative	then , and only then , with 000_% certainty should you book a procedure and pay the deposit , as once it '_s paid , you will never see it again .
positive	maxima are so efficient and i always recommend them to family and friends .
negative	wanted me to post them proof of my address before processing my order as an " additional security_measure " - and i had to wait 00_mins in their phone queue for the privilege of finding that out .

neutral	i ordered prescription_sunglasses , using the size of my current spectacles as a guide .
neutral	was told the flowers were lovely but haven_'_t seen them .
neutral	well_packaged but let_down by slow delivery by courier , it took a week - yes a full 0 days to receive my goods .

neutral	i was quite shocked as the tables looked to be poor quality and definitely couldn_'_t use them so i contacted customer_services to see what i could do .
neutral	the replacement was dealt_with quickly and professionally , however one would expect to be re -_imbursed to some extent for the inconvenience .
neutral	i personally prefer the previous model . i am happy to order etc on line but find the current model a bit convoluted and slows the delivery of service to customers . i have marked it acceptable largely beacause i am a long_standing customer and have good local_branch
neutral	we had an awful experience .
neutral	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !
positive	difficulties of getting something big from a to b were completely sorted by using anyvan ; once i had described what i needed , quotes came through in 00_mins , and were v . competitive .

neutral	i emailed back immediately saying don_'_t worry just cancel that item off the order and send the other two items ( one of which was charcoal i needed for the weekend ) , no response so i emailed again 0 days_later , still nothing .
negative	secondly , my cashback hasn_'_t been credited to my account .

negative	i waited all day and night , nothing !
positive	i would use this supplier for all my electrical requirements as they are good value and offer an excellant service .
neutral	unfortunately , the returns_procedure is less satisfactory and i was advised to return item by special delivery which cost me a whopping_£_00 .
negative	e . g .
positive	they are solid , 00mm_thick and very heavy , bear that in mind when you order as fitting is at_least a two man job .

neutral	i had to ring team c courier in the uk who told me for this package they were using dhl but this may change .
negative	never , i repeat , never buy through top cash_back if the cash_back is the reason .
negative	it goes without saying that the paintings arrived 0_days late , meaning blank walls at the exhibition , and the cancellation of the opening .

negative	they are almost_impossible to contact ( it took me many many hours ) and they have no idea where the goods they claim to have dispatched may be .
neutral	yes i got what i ordered but i do not recommend to use this company if you are in a hurry .
negative	when i spoke to the store to complain they made no effort to offer any sort of compensation for their mistake and in fact proceeded to tell me how their margins were already very low and they had lost money by delivering the wrong cooker and that i had already got a great deal etc_etc .
neutral	it was my fault of course as i didn_'_t read the description of the contents but when the parcel arrived i was disappointed that no wine was included .

neutral	i have taken out a contract but am very disappointed with the internet experience .
neutral	bearing in mind we arrived at nearly 00pm so it was nearly the end of our night and we had nowehere to stay .
negative	this did not happen so at 00 . 00 i phoned them , after 00_minutes of being on hold i was then told that the manager was in a meeting but they will be sending my treadmill out that day so i would get it on monday and would not be charged the delivery .
neutral	well i spent some time getting prices for my items and packing them up .
neutral	edit_: i '_ve since been contacted by fantastic cleaners who have apologised and insisted they will amend the marketing and not repeat this mistake .
positive	communication is always superb , customer service is how it should be .
positive	). there was one item i wanted that they didn_'_t have but overall very pleased with quality of items , service and prices so i and would recommend to friends .
positive	happy for us to return item if not satisfied .
negative	the bouquet was mostly padded out with gypsophila ( all of which i removed before giving to my wife ).
negative	we have not been able to contact the company so my recommendation would be to shop elsewhere .
negative	to be perfectly honest i have ordered from simply in the past and had no_problems but this company is now nothing but pathetic excuses and no action .
negative	so i had two parcels that needed collecting and delivering .
negative	it would have been very helpful if the furniture_market had told us this in advance .
negative	haven_'_t had any update of missing item .
negative	we also prepay the delivery charge .
negative	bought this part as it said in description that it would fit my dyson_hoover part came and didn_'_t fit would nt buy from here again .
negative	i was supposed to have had a parcel delivered on the monday_morning however i did not receive it at all that day , i checked my online order details with littlewoods & it told me that the parcel had been loaded on to the van at the lincoln depot however i did not receive it that day .
neutral	i like all the items i have received , they are as they should be with out complaint .
negative	although it was known the item i ordered was not in stock and had to be ' shipped in ' i wasn_'_t informed of this .
negative	this is not the way how things should be done , you sent me faulty goods so it should be up to tackle_uk to get the item picked_up , not me to send it back to you .
neutral	the gentleman that dealt_with us was polite , courteous and efficient .
neutral	i said belfast is not foreign .
neutral	0 . also ( l understand extra security ) but it turned_out out to be added stress upon the guarantor and the client needing the loan .
positive	the prices are brilliant compared to high_street shops and the delivery of my order spot_on .
positive	excellent service
positive	delivery is very quick also .
neutral	we deliberately took the ' red_route ' bus so that we could benefit from a local guide who would hopefully educate and entertain us .
neutral	l clark
positive	i had a number of questions about the insurance and also the place i was going to .
neutral	they have good selection of product but you can get better prices ( free delivery ) elsewhere .
negative	extremely disappointed !!
positive	envirofone kept me informed every_step of the way .
positive	ordered books from this company on several_occassions .
negative	never again and i will never tell anyone_else to do the trip .
positive	best price on the net for the item i bought .
negative	i phoned the next_day wednesday 00th_may to be told the same story , done on thursday 00th_may .
positive	we knew where we wanted to go and she gave_us her advice and of course fantastic price and on no occasion were we pressurised to use the company or bombarded with telephone_calls which is what we had with other_companies .
positive	very helpful introduction with a lot of practical advice , definitely recommend .
neutral	).
negative	had finished a phone_call where the conclusion was that i was to send back the unused tickets for a full_refund ( minus £_00 in charges ) only to be phoned back saying that was a mistake , and it would be a total of £_00 charges , along with me buying new tickets .
negative	i asked for this order to be cancelled and they shipped it out anyway .
negative	here is the beauty though , after informing_me of this next point they are now backtracking & denying it .
neutral	having made my order i was then informed that glasses i had ordered were no_longer instock and should not have been showing .
neutral	i have bought from the happy_puzzle company for a number of years_now .
neutral	the price was pretty reasonable , about 00 quid but when i saw the flowers they weren_'_t great and very small .
positive	great watch , very happy .
negative	if three delivery attempts fail , they will keep it in their warehouse .
negative	not only that , but they hadn_'_t even ordered the correct model in the first place , so they didn_'_t have the correct replacement cooker in stock .
negative	( remember i had been told by a manager that installing the box would inprove my speed , so the engineer would do it !)
negative	the final excuse on 00st_january_0000 of darren losing his voice meant i asked for my money back to be told i should contact my card_issuer and get them to do a chargeback .
positive	since installation we have had strong_winds , the unit is so well installed its stuck firm with no_issues .
neutral	come on virgin .
positive	many_thanks animed xxxxx
positive	derek
positive	i found this service through an internet_search and having read the reviews , i plumped for them .
neutral	price was ok , delivery was excellent ( if not a little over priced ).
negative	worst customer service ever !
neutral	the quote came out more_expensive however still very reasonable and affordable for cystic fibrosis that has required iv antibiotic treatment in the last 00 weeks and cfr diabetes .
positive	the latest dell precision was needed very urgently and despite the pc only coming into stock in the afternoon , it was shipped that night so that i could have it ready for my new employee the nex day .
negative	saying well it '_s only 0pm .
negative	!
positive	i absolutely love the design of my invites and stationary , and as i took_advantage of the february offer , i got a fantastic deal :_o_)
positive	it was returned before i knew i had lost it , no charge .
neutral	did not realize until pushing the button that i could have specified upgraded photo_paper .
neutral	they did offer to send it back for free .
neutral	apple_iphone mobile ( facebook ) keeps_crashing , when your paying all that money you want more than just a die hard sequel that like the films gets higher & higher , but the bottom_line is they all do the same thing , break easy , battery_life cant cope with lots going on , so is it really a mobile when your always plugged in the mains or waiting for it to be repaired ( have a spare back up phone to be safe )
negative	if you answer one of these it will give you a link to the web chat team .
negative	called wahanda and was told ' your call is now next in the queue ' over and over again for over 00_mins before i was hung_up on .
negative	ok bye now ".
negative	he said the customer service team would contact me that afternoon with an_appointment date .
positive	it looks really classy beside our front_door and has already attracted compliments from visitors and passers - by .
positive	to cut as long_story_short i bought a steelseries keyboard that had faulty keys , they offered to send some new ones in the post that never turned_up !
positive	never had any_problems with amazon .
negative	just delivered next_day - arrived only next_day - who needs flowers if they do not arrive on time - people could have been out of the country next_day .
neutral	i '_ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
positive	looking_forward to hearing how my family liked their flowers .
positive	i always buy from them on a regular_basis .
negative	i had to request and state that i did not want to pay return postage ( you normally pay for returns ) and reluctantly i got a ticket emailed to me , also a 00_%_off next order .
negative	there is no option to create my own return_label on the collect_+ website for this retailer either - tried to email care @ hutgroup . com and got a failed deliver response .
neutral	i bought a pc in april last_year from dino_pc and it is still going_strong with no_problems .
neutral	the site will not accept my passwords , and their is no tesco store around the area i live , the nearest one being 00 miles_away .
negative	have just had my bill and guess_what ?
negative	0_weeks_later despite_numerous_emails from me , i was still_waiting for my bean_bag .
negative	think of your customers and your customer_care ratings there '_s a lot of upset people who have purchased from you and been let_down .
positive	you can see the back of the villa next door , but you don_'_t see the residents very often .
neutral	as usual finding my tire was not a problem even_though they are rare .
positive	i won_'_t bore you with the details , but what i will say , is that the customer service staff at thedrinkshop went out of their way to help me resolve the problems with each , even arguing my case ( successfully ) with the courier when they asked me to pay a redelivery charge .
negative	it now looks_like the wait for the doors will extend to three or four months .
negative	apart_from that , the house was dusty and not as_described on their website .
positive	in addition , the service is quick and always sent in good protective_packaging .
negative	first they did not process the order , as we called they said the account is open now .
negative	the other 0 had very few flowers .
positive	first time i used the rug_house and i was slightly cautious in case the product wasn_'_t good .
neutral	been waiting over 0_weeks now for the money to arrive .
positive	didn_'_t have one of the items in stock - which hey . it happens .
neutral	they did not want to try all of us with the same name and embarrass those who had not thought to send flowers .
neutral	as i was changing internet service providers and was left without internet for two_days , i initially phoned them up to order the car_seat .
neutral	six days after my order , stuff is still not shipped from the warehouse .
positive	all done without_any fuss on my own driveway .
negative	fine – we thought .
positive	thankyou
neutral	the response was no , they did not do old parts but could let_me have a reframe at a reduced price of £_00 ( which i declined .)

positive	i cant fully review service yet as my tyres and m . o . t .
negative	i have tried contacting them a number of times regarding this matter but they once again impossible to get_hold of .
positive	i have used hifi heaphones for a few_years_now , making all my headphone purchases through them as there is always someone on the end of the phone willing to help and offer their personal services to you .
positive	it arrived 0_days_later , on time , and in a nice clean packet in my letter_box .
positive	and the books arrive shortly_after being ordered .
positive	in desperation , we ordered a back up from viovet , which arrived , as promised , before 00pm the next_day .
negative	hanwell .
neutral	play . com offer some great goods at reasonable prices , my only complaint is the speed of delivery , it normally takes 0 - 0 days to deliver to worcester uk , orders form amazon also based in jersey , normally arrive in 0 - 0 days .
negative	anyone with any technical_knowledge would recognize that over time the forces acting on the cantilever arms will loosen the fixings and cause the tv to plummet to the floor .
positive	thanks
positive	would use them again without_hesitation
negative	citylink lost package , and would not respond to calls or emails until i mentioned the police .
negative	despite the address being correct and cross_referenced with googe and 000 . com , there driver could not deliver would not recommend high disappointed .
neutral	it was however a fab item - so i kept it rather_than complaining and asking for refund .
positive	super quick delivery .
positive	i must_admit to a haglofs habit and castleberg is my preferred choice for any kit i might want .

neutral	so let_me start by saying that my product did arrive and it was in good condition .
negative	i changed my billing_address to match the information i provided and informed them and my order was taken off hold .
negative	it '_s a shame as my previous upgrade with them was fine .
neutral	. not very immpresive .
negative	this too developed a fault and was clearly unfit for purpose , after negotiating with expansys for quite some time on how this would eb dealt_with i agreed for them to process another repair , with a replacement item being provided if this was unsuccessful .
negative	i '_ve just found out that i '_ve been paying £_00 a month and not getting my 0g - awful .
positive	ordering was simple , price reasonable , delivery prompt .
positive	richard ( sheffield )
positive	shoes are great too .
negative	yet their website misleads you by comparing their prices with bt and talktalk who allow unlimited minutes in their call allowance .
neutral	whether they will or not is another matter .

neutral	as we were a party of six i decided to call up the call_centre .
negative	i sought_advice from my doctor , who confidently provided the required medical reasoning document multitrip required ( for £_00 .) and thus i expected at_least a helpful response .
negative	après trois appels de_ma part au service clientèle de dior , toujours en contact avec la même conseillère qui me traita telle une moins que rien et voyant que ma_commande ne l ' intéressait guère , j ' ai contacté moi - même fia - net qui m ' a gentiment et promptement répondu que ma_commande avait été certifié par leurs services ( et ce , je_le rappelle , sans aucune demande de vérifications de leur part ).
neutral	very poor .
negative	i never recieved the items and couldnt contact anyone at the company by email or phone .

neutral	after several emails back and forth the delivery was made at midday .
neutral	good price , good comms & fast delivery .
negative	i then emailed another complaint to the same email address as i was not going to make the mistake of calling them .
negative	the only positive thing is that i '_m clearly not the only one who has felt the need to vent some truly disgraceful issues .
neutral	i also feel the company need to change the way you pay so people can pay little and often as i found those tight for money struggled with the bulk payments and deadlines .
positive	no up selling just making_sure you get what you need .
negative	here is the first problem : i was taking about wanting to watch tv and the guy said i could watch sky_sports and showed me the app on his phone .

neutral	unfortunately we found them abandoned on the door_step !

positive	this is what customer service is all about , nothing was too much_trouble for them , we were kept_informed at every_step of our sale and had constant_contact from them through each_stage , unlike high_street agents who say they are working on your behalf ( but we have found this not to be the case ) house_network really do deliver on all counts .
positive	bought two more pairs of glasses as so pleased with value and service . will probably get some more and recomend to everyone .
neutral	many carriers now give approx time slots .
neutral	the listings pages are easy to use and there is a clear promise that if it says it '_s in stock it will be .
positive	so buy something for you - not the house , not the kids , not the other half - something for you - a guilt free present that costs you absolutely nothing .
neutral	wasn_'_t worth sending it back to be replaced but would have hoped for better .
neutral	!
negative	got home at 0000 and went outside to leave a note on my front_door to say , could they use the back door but there was a missed delivery note already there .
neutral	compared to other_retailers i think these details should be part of the company '_s focus on customer service .
positive	was looking for a chiminea to finish our new pagoda patio off , but it needed to fit in with the stone benches & circle , so started looking via_google .
positive	flawless service .
positive	lo and behold there was a table and mirror from the same suite and both were the perfect size for us .
neutral	ordered on fri 00th_november , delivered monday 00th
negative	tried booking flights / hotel package online , saw a good deal , entered_details for 0 people , names , dates of birth etc etc , by the time i pressed confirm , the flights had gone .
negative	so don_'_t expect it to change if you complain , and i doubt it will get better .
negative	in short , i never did receive the item i '_d paid for .
neutral	these are heavy oak pieces of furniture & i was a woman on my own .
negative	the customer service agent was terrible .
negative	i still hadn_'_t received them after 00_hours .
negative	it all went south with the takeover of amazon and subsequently i have just cancelled my membership as not wasting anymore money .
neutral	waited for the call and eventaually rang again and after a bit of back and forth received the dimensions and ordered the bench .
positive	overall a fantastic experience and will certainly use it again and recommend to friends .
neutral	however they accepted the cancellation and refunded the money quickly .
neutral	next time , if i use serenata again , i '_ll just settle for the free delivery and save my blood_pressure !
positive	use a very efficient courier comoaby - quick delivery .
neutral	was delighted with the quality of it and can '_t wait to see my grandson learning with it .
positive	an easy transaction from_start to finish .
negative	consigned to the garage .
negative	if you try to contact them by phone they leave you hanging ( twice more than 00_minutes , with no answer either time ) and you are paying charges for the phone_call . they keep_repeating ' we value your call ' and i bet they really do - they ' re earning_money on it !
positive	i ordered some batteries which totalled less_than £ 0 - which would have been £ 0 in the supermarket - and got free p_&_p to boot .
positive	have been speaking to ' rowan ' for an eta on my delivery .
positive	more then happy to deal with them again & will recommend to friends .
neutral	that means in the future i may have to wait ( which i expect and don_'_t mind ) but how do i know which day ?
positive	!
negative	emailed go - electrical to say i was out of pocket and would they refund my expense , they said they were sending out a replacement - this was unnecessary as i had paid to fix it and asked again for them to refund my out of pocket expense which they refused as they had ordered another one wihtout discussing the options with me .
negative	for your own sake do not use this company and make_sure you tell as many people as you can so no one else gets conned by them .
neutral	i have seen them and i am very disapointed with them .
positive	one very slight drawback and that was they couldn_'_t assist with flight upgrading on virgin so had to take the risk of doing it at the airport , otherwise all in all will_def book again with them
positive	i have to say i am hugely_impressed by the overall quality .
neutral	i have used cybercandy a few_times , but find that the website isn_'_t very modern or well - organised .
positive	didn_'_t .
positive	a encomenda_chegou com tudo certinho e mais rápido do que estava à espera .
neutral	i sent an_email to say i had received something different to what i had ordered and they got back to me within a couple of hours , however they wanted a photo of the bags before they could help me but i was out and my phone is not reliable for sending emails so therefore i couldn_'_t send a picture until i had access to the internet .
neutral	the glass fitting company obtained some lenghts of rubber to fit the windows and fitted them no problem .
neutral	the dimensions were not on the website , rang the helpline and the gentleman while helpful could not find the dimensions either and said he ' d leave instructions to get the information to me and get the dimensions on the website .
negative	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
neutral	they had to re - order the part which did arrive a couple of days_later .
negative	no apology at all for providing out of date information .
neutral	i was about to order again when the blinds arrived !!
negative	oh_yeah it is only 0 months old
neutral	there is more but i do not want this to turn in to a rant .
negative	shocking after sales service !. since using them have read numerous bad_experiences with them on review sites .
positive	!

neutral	j . mcculloch
negative	back valance shodily replaced to ( con ) seel this damage .
negative	i refused the delivery of only one order ( an innistrad booster box , which i now regret ) and you took the postage_costs from my refund , so you didn_'_t pay royal_mail .

neutral	after surviving cancer for the third time , this was my reward blow out holiday to myself .
negative	the to staff couldn_'_t get to the door quicker !
neutral	merchandise spot on but the delivery was a shambles waited in for two_days because they said th delivery was one day then the next arrived day 0
negative	their hardware is okay , far from the best out there , but does the job . until some hidden self - destruct mechanism goes off after a predetermined time ( that '_s my belief anyway ).
negative	and now you ' re asking me for feedback -
positive	added to that , due to an error i made in my order , the sales_person i spoke to was extremely_helpful and resolved my error and the battery was despatched , arriving on time .
positive	first_class service . very helpful staff . did as promised which is unual these days .
negative	they owe me two payments for none delivery of goods , poor service from india
negative	they never reply to emails , i have to ring them up to contact them .
positive	fast delivery and far less expensive than the big_players
positive	very quick delivery , product excellent value first_rate company
neutral	after telephone_call ( which suggested could not be used for payment ) i was talked through a procedure that managed to work and have now got the product - still to be installed .
positive	the order process was simple and straight_forward , but what was the best part was the updates on where my order was right up until the delivery .
negative	her attitude really upset me and pretty_much told me it was my own fault ( yes , i was my own fault , but it '_s not ok for a customer service rep to say that ),
positive	i would definitely order from them again , and would certainly recommend them .
positive	the only_slight comment i would make is that when diagnosing the problem with my shower and reading the question and answer section the answers indicated that if the solenoid had a resistance of 0 . 0kohm or more than it was ok .
positive	thank_you jules_b will diffenately purchase from you again
negative	i would ensure that none of friends use this company !

neutral	we are in the caribbean and needed some beige whipping twine .
positive	i have always used a tour_operator , so was a bit_wary .

neutral	no_frills service
negative	it was easy to buy and pay for but what happened then was a disaster .
neutral	just not long moved back to vodafone contract after a long , long time on o0
positive	my sister introduced me to quidco .
negative	don_'_t believe anything that the bbc puts out , not even the weather report .
positive	the delivery guys were really helpful when they eventually found my house and delivery was within the time stated , they unpacked and checked the cabinets over too before they left .
neutral	why so ?
neutral	ordered over the internet quickly and order was dispatched quickly , but was not happy with courier you use , he rang my mobile as my husband had to leave after waiting in all morning to ask if their was anyone_else i could leave my parcel with , i asked him to leave it with my neighbour next door or one up , but when my husband returned , a card was left to say it had been returned to depot miles_away , luckily we do have a car and were able to drive their taken another morning up , my neighbour had been in as she seen him leave our path with out knocking , on collecting my parcel it took over half an_hour to retrieve it , would definitely recommend a different courier or prefer it to be send royal_mail as i know if not delivered it would be taken to a local_depot a few miles_away
neutral	we prepaid the car and thought everything was fine .
neutral	payment_methods very limited too , but delivery fast and reliable
negative	very poor , ended_up cancelling within a few_days .
positive	tracy pearson
neutral	the carrier lets you know on the day by email by 0am which specific time_slot you have been allotted .
negative	the boats ok , exactly_what you would expect from a cross_channel ferry .
neutral	we write to complain regarding the above order of bedroom_furniture taken by your designer , john fox on 00th_january .
neutral	left me feeling reluctant to use the company a again and would definitely be wary of after sale calls .
negative	tesco assured this would be corrected , but due to shortage of people they could no_longer deliver that day .
neutral	when it comes to physical items that are sent by mail , paypal continues to be my first service .
neutral	use the foil that they use !
neutral	not bad service
negative	today i ordered through the website and on confirmation it said for collection .
neutral	after more than a week overdue it hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	i requested a time for the parcel to be picked_up , but unfortunately , the courier didn_'_t turn_up in the allotted_time .
negative	?
negative	nothing .
positive	the only point i would make is that since this transaction i have noticed that another company pays for the special delivery of the phone ( s ) whereas i paid nearly_£ 0 .
positive	i received a phone_call the night before to tell me to expect the delivery along with a tracking_number .
negative	they have it in the small_print that their option 0 only allows 000 inclusive call minutes .
positive	the price was the cheapest found online and the ease in ordering and delivery was great .
neutral	great product .
positive	lenstore delivered remarkably quickly .
positive	superfast service . i would highly_recommend .
neutral	ordering was easy and it was delivered on time .
neutral	i have orderd before and never had a problem - so assume it was just a gremlin .
negative	terrible service i ordered flowers in good time and didn_'_t arrive on specific day i contacted eflorist who just told me i should have read small_print and used a florist if i wanted them for a specific day i felt the adviser was having a laugh at my expense . they arrived a day late but wasn_'_t left even_though i left clear delivery instructions emails haven_'_t been answered . please read other review sites to get a clear picture of this company . they just don_'_t care about the customer when things go_wrong and ignore you
neutral	disappointed with the way your company has advertised on line price '_s , you advertise price at £_00 . 00 went into book after filling out my details and price went up to £_00 . 00 , false_advertising if you ask me
neutral	i fact i ' d go as far as to say 0 out of 0 !
neutral	very slow to process the delivery .
positive	apart_from the excess packing , far too much for my green bid , it was exactly_what i expected .
neutral	i emailed last night including pictures but still_awaiting reply .
positive	when the collection had finished , i phoned fonebank and they picked_up the phones the next_day .
positive	works effectively .
negative	i '_ve tried_calling several_times and just end up hearing " your call will be answered shortly ", their email ' service ' advertises a reply in 0 business days ( really ?
neutral	when i first booked the gentleman was great and we set_up suitable activities and times .

neutral	the cleaners only cleaned once in the whole fortnight - didn_'_t even clean outside then .
negative	very rude customer service
positive	would thoroughly_recommend atlantic_signs .
positive	they made the whole_process of buying & receiving quality furniture seemless , no_fuss , quick and efficient .
neutral	only problem this time was that i agreed with you that the item could be left in our garden and i would leave a tarpaulin out to cover it in the event of rain .

neutral	if you are someone_who spends a lot of time wearing a tuxedo then spend some more money on something decent but if you are like me and need something for that very rare black_tie occasion then this will do .
positive	on time , on price and easy .
negative	so i rang and asked for confirmation of my order in writing they stumbled and mumbled around " their systems " before telling_me that unfortunately they had sent my confirmation_email to the wrong_address . after telling them how unprofessional this was especially if any of my payment details were in the email they eventually agreed to resend the email , unfortunately the lady in customer_services slammed the phone down before i had a chance to thank her .

neutral	ziffit claimed to have not received these , even_though they had all been sent in the same parcel ( checked and double - checked by myself and my wife before sending ).
neutral	second class deliveries are pretty slow and , i '_ve had one that didn_'_t arrive , so it '_s worth_paying the extra £ 0 for first_class delivery .
positive	ordered at 0 , 00 on a saturday_night , delivery was on the following_day .
neutral	bought some beautiful orchids for my mum '_s birthday - great value and the flowers were stunning .
neutral	as any other monopoly , having stock that other_sites don_'_t have , they set the prices of knives ( usually high ) and despite 0 years of regular expensive purchases , cumulating to above 0000 £ when kindly asked of a coupon ( that they otherwise offer monthly to certain magazines readers ) they didn_'_t offer one .

positive	anyways , i am happy with this company and i hope that this transaction goes through smoothly so that i can continue to purchase from this company in the future .

neutral	the petrol needle was a hairs breadth below full - unless you are aware of the shell station , hidden away in belgravia ( sixt certainly don_'_t tell you ) then there is nowhere obvious to top up , if indeed it had been possible given how full the tank was .
negative	vendor would not help or budge at all .
positive	i felt devastated .
neutral	compared with other supermarket_chains i would describe aldis website as boring and laclustre .

negative	thank_you cash_generator for your terrible service and causing my brother to go without a birthday_present .
neutral	however , some of the items were rejected which was disappointing e . g .
positive	well priced item and item is as_described - very good transaction
negative	factor in the 00mph vehicle limiter , the one way systems and ' pedestrian ' and / or ' no loading after 00am ' zones in city centres , or single drops that are nowhere_near any other drop that take another hour just for one packet ( that cannot possibly be cost_effective and would be cheaper to post ) and with an average of 00 drops per day it soon becomes a mammoth task to complete all drops within an effective 0 hours paid delivery window .
negative	i had some tiles delivered today the driver was rude and abrupt had no manners . when you have a delivery and paid alot of money you expect service with a smile
positive	when the book arrived , i was delighted , the quality is fantastic and i can '_t wait to see my daughter '_s face when she_opens it for the first time .
positive	ordered rather near to christmas , last_minute ideas !
neutral	however , the experience was tainted by the fact that the flowers were dead .

negative	?
neutral	the price was extrememly competitive and it was showing as in stock , however a couple of days after ordering it i received an email_saying that it was out of stock and they were waiting for their suppliers to provide it .

positive	happy to command you !
negative	which is dam wrong .
neutral	credit appeared on my mastercard but i have not had any communication from them .
positive	had no time to order a sample , just bit the bullet and placed the order .
neutral	especially_considering the spiel you get from the company of how they should be packaged " very comfortably , very securely , and very elegantly " the box was double the size of the flowers and they were not securely fastened so could fly from one side of the box to the other and looked a little like they had done just that when they arrived .
positive	i went on to this site as my son purchases direct from them regularly , i wanted to get him a little surprise for his_birthday and purchased a voucher online .
positive	i was very impressed by jackie , who had been recommended to me by a friend .

negative	they are delivering the glasses for me but if i could i would have cancelled the transaction .
neutral	the screws were not always long enough for fixing through overlaps and i would of preferred a self_tapping screw to ensure a tight fit .
neutral	a few_days_later i got an_email to say " this item is now discontinued ".
neutral	excellent service & delivery but coffee just doesn_'_t have the quality of taste .

positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	on top of that , the goods i orderded ( 0 " x00 " plastic_bags ) are all too short !
neutral	i order alll my beauty products on line and usually received goods within five days .

positive	would shop_here again without_hesitation .
positive	after_searching various_sites on line , we decided on mail order trees .
neutral	my cards arrived with my photograph of bomber command , quickly and beautifully_printed as always .
neutral	excellent customer service but let_down_badly by the courier company they use .
neutral	neil

negative	or has fallen out of it , which isn_'_t surprising when i saw the way he squashed my valubale stuff into his manky old transit .

positive	well_done drinksdirect , i will definitely order from you again , and not just ricard .
negative	the barking is answer enough for me .
negative	i then had a call from rajapack and they told me they were sorry and there was a mistake they took my card_details to refund one of my payments onto my card .
negative	requested refund three_times , refund never came !
neutral	overall the service was reasonable , we bought a substancial amount of furniture , however had i known that i had to unpack this i don_'_t think i would have bought it .
negative	i ordered online from justoffbase and although the website shows stock they did not have any and no planned stock so they refunded my money .

negative	i also specified on the order that if we were not home when being delivered they should be left at rear of house .
neutral	the website says 00_hours to process , however mine took 00_hours , so beware if drugs are running_low .
positive	i would most certainly use printzone again with confidence .
neutral	having said all that , we are very satisfied with the goods , we would used nets 0 go again , but would suggest that there is more contact with the customer , when problems_arise , i would have gladly waited for the order , had i known there was some sort of problem , its was the not knowing that created problems .

neutral	the whole ordering process was straightforward and was pleased with sample service , however one of my sample selections was out of stock & i never received it .
positive	a lot of others could_learn from this , as it should be .
negative	when they received it they changed it to £_00 due to screen damage - faulty pixels . i insisted they returned it .
neutral	the chosen courier service is letting pet_supermarket down .
neutral	both of which were broken by fedex .
neutral	if i ' d have walked_into a florist and asked them to build me a bouquet for the same money i spent , i ' d have got a much_better result .
positive	i was kept up to date with the progress of my order and it arrived exactly in the time_slot that i was given

negative	shipping can be delayed . which is frustrating .
positive	no !
negative	i asked how can you explain my email order confirmation on 00th_december then ?
negative	we find the stools very uncomfortable , the back rest cuts right into your lower back , we removed the backrests .
neutral	the surface i could fix , so i just raised the not square edge .
negative	i have never come_across this type of abuse of customer rights .
positive	good onsite info plus a you tube product review link told me everything i needed to know about what i was buying before i bought it .
negative	this company has lost my trust completely .
neutral	then i got an_email_saying interparcel couldn_'_t pick_up today , but would come tomorrow .
positive	they went out of there way to get the order right and under alot of pressure from me .
negative	was sent broken and packaging was awful .
positive	everything you could_possibly_need from a pharmacy and more with one click .
neutral	whereas , yours came in a brown envelope . so i feel really disappointed .

positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	overall a positive_experience but i did pay for express delivery and do not feel that i got it which was a shame .
neutral	we were in a postion were we could wait it out , so opted to do so .
neutral	this has happened before in other collect_plus shops . they seem to not like having a large parcel in the way .
negative	i '_m not sure i trust the positive_reviews on here .
negative	however , the cost of the item was £ 0 . 00 .
negative	after 00 days ( on an apparently 0 - 0 working day standard delivery ), there was still no sign of the item , so emailed via the website .
neutral	in the picture i could see the cooked brown buckwheat - " kasha " - as it should be , so i was looking_forward to getting it .
negative	this is the last day but still no sign of the items so i e_- mailed and called the customer_services .
negative	no responding to e_-_mails asking for the parcels arrivel and explanations for delaying things .
negative	rang the customer_services number and a kind lady said no problem i can cancel your order and you won_'_t have any charges .
neutral	all hire_cars should be delivered and returned with full tanks and economycarrentals should not use hire_companies that don_'_t have this fuel_policy .

positive	glasses ordered in the afternoon and delivered the following_day .
neutral	i would give them another go as i '_ve discovered nice maternity_clothes are quite hard to find , but if i experience any further delivery problems i '_d probably give it up .
neutral	interlink system for redelivery seems to be lacking in a system some how .
positive	so , all in all a great shopping_experience !
neutral	while accidents_happen i believe some of the stress and problems could have been relieved by decisions having been made quicker , surely it must have been realised early on that the damage could not have been repaired that day .

positive	the transmission shop ltd
positive	amazing value and very fast delivery .
neutral	after telling us that seats were available if we called at the porto pollenca office it transpired that it is not possible to transfer flight_bookings .

positive	would use again .
negative	i purchased a product on 00 / 00 /_0000 and to this date ( 0 / 00 / 00 ) have still not received my product .
negative	i asked for a refund .

neutral	it arrived_safely so i suppose that is a good thing !
positive	delivery drivers are helpful and friendly .

positive	it sits in my kitchen the centre piece of attention .
neutral	i am in my seventies , living on my own , it would have been helpful not to be faced with the prospect of dealing_with the unpacking of this large heavy package on my own , not to mention having to cut up the cardboard and manhandle the packaging to the local tip !
negative	items are of good quality however but i got sick of waiting and ordered elsewhere and have returned the items from 00mx straight back to germany with their freepost_returns system .
neutral	i joined_topcashback after_reading recommendations from various_sources including the daily mail and was pleased to gain £ 0 . 00 cashback after buying an item of furniture - however when i asked for my cashback to be paid into my account i only received 0 . 00 pence as topcashback took £ 0 in admin_fees which i wasn_'_t expecting and hadn_'_t been forewarned about - very disappointing and hardly worth_bothering with !

neutral	i '_ve ordered about 0 orders form exante 0 have never turned_up although they did replace them but having to wait 0_weeks when on this diet before they '_ll reissue them is rubbish , a maximum of 0 days should be enough especially as they use a courier company .

neutral	however , after calling o0 , i later discovered that this is not the case as i could have called them for free and had them administrate it for free .
positive	we live local to the company and called into the office and discussed what we needed .
neutral	i would recommend you at_least offer a free / cheaper option for delivery with a longer delivery time .
positive	a quick bit of googling revealed that lenstore was within a few_pence of the best price for the eyedrops we were after .
negative	i asked for and idea of how long i would possibly wait for an_appointment once the part is in and he said " about 0 or 0_days " ( in other words how long is a piece of string .

positive	a great addition to our home .
positive	easy online purchase .
negative	unreal .

negative	i provided authorisation to charge the shipping cost but feel that they were very unprofessional in charging the spare_part and giving the impression that this was the only cosy , only to refuse to ship the part unless an additional payment was made .
positive	very easy to use - genuinely the cheapest we found .
positive	a word of caution to the unweary , these worktops are the real deal .

negative	hundreds of unnecessary numbers for diff departments and they cant seem to put you through .
neutral	i was not happy about this so i decided to book it via expedia website .
positive	easy to track the parcel , and you are given a one hour delivery time_slot estimate , which they met .
neutral	then when they sent me a confirmation e_- mail it said that i could " track your order now " by logging in through " my account ".
positive	best value i found comparing many online stores .
positive	will_definitely shop in a future again .
negative	i assumed this was an_oversight as the person mentioned there was only one t in my name on the bank details so i went back online to resubmit the application .
neutral	if you are going to cut_corners and costs gd - do it in the back room not at the customer face - i will not be returning
neutral	great technical_support but sales don_'_t reply to enquires until the next_day which has lead them loosing 0 sales from me in the last 0 months .
neutral	the first delivery was really quick , but to redeliver is a 0 day wait and then by the time i had arranged the third delivery it was well over a week . from placing my order .
neutral	or should i say , non - delivery team .
negative	so , i am woman , so i set my alarm for ten to six , because i say sod '_s law .
neutral	bread is best around , some fruit and veg good .
positive	furthermore , almost_half the price of the high_street .
neutral	can '_t believe they can miss that ?
positive	quality and customer service are consistent and we will definitaly purchase again !
negative	like other people i sent my phone off to envirofone .
neutral	he looked at his schedule and gave_us the times .
positive	the price i paid was the best i could find for the same model elsewhere , and all my internet dealings were instantly backed_up with emails and text_alerts , right down to the hour that delivery would take place .
negative	to say the least , seems like argos need to update their systems and reconsider their suppliers .
negative	finally call the ( premium_rate ) phone line to book another appointment and the earliest date available is now 00th_october .
negative	after purchasing and paying for an item through this website , via_paypal - not a cheap purchase either ( nearly_£_000 ), i was never sent the item .
neutral	it would be much_better if they did a collect in store and return service .
negative	edit_: forgive my anger , but to pay £_00 and still be waiting for 0 days after ordering , i cannot forgive gameseek for this , and i hope it comes by monday or i '_m getting a refund .
neutral	i took the diamond and necklace to a jewelers for them to fix it together .
positive	i found it a very easy site to use , posted off the prescription and the product arrived very quickly , faultless service .
neutral	some employees are chearful but most are not happy .
positive	i have the shampoo , conditioner , and protection spray all made my hair extentions feel better already been using them for about 0weeks but could see the difference straight_away
negative	i am utterly convinced that every_single five - star_review of o0 i read on this site has_been written with the promise of money involved ; i refuse to believe that they are legitimate , and if any of you o0 lackeys are reading this and you ' d like to debate what i '_m saying , go_ahead .
positive	awesome site , so glad i joined !
negative	this is what happened next , day of delivery finally arrived and they delivered just 0 bottles , my order was for 00 bottles .
negative	it took 0 days , and two nagging emails from me to acknowledge the playbook had even arrived .
positive	thank_you so much
negative	rang back carphone_warehouse to explain the above , no satisfactory_explanation just told me i had been declined due to adverse credit , this is utter nonsense as i have since seen my equifax credit_report which has no marks or blemishes and scores me as " excellent ", the only offer your staff made was to try another network .
negative	i am outraged at this poor customer service .
neutral	they asked me to find a vehicle once i arrived at my location from a rental car company and that they would compensate for the cost .
neutral	the flowers were great and the delivery very prompt and efficient .
neutral	if you say 0 - 00 delivery you should adhere to it , i didn_'_t get any notice of delay until too late , was embarrassed had to rearrange fit date with my customer at my cost , felt quite unprofessional
positive	the day after that i received an_email to say they had it and had credited my bank_account with the £_00 .
positive	very friendly & easy to use .
neutral	i am sure bedkingdom are a good company , they just need reliable delivery company
negative	maybe a lawyer would help getting heard .
neutral	in the meantime i have had to order the plus size costume which is more money and is far to big but i have to sew in all places to fit my entertainer .
neutral	when it is about virtual items ( in game items etc .
neutral	i '_m_sure if i hadn_'_t phoned , they still wouldn_'_t have chased the order up .
neutral	mazuma was fast in payment and reliable as they kept to their words of the agreed sum .
neutral	i guess the larger_size though would be too long on the straps .
neutral	the deal i purchased was a rolling_contract , 00 days cancellation notice .
neutral	i upgraded these flowers to medium_size and was quite disappointed when i went to my mums to see her .
positive	product arrived in perfect_condition and i got a very polite email which i will quote , " thank_you for your business and of course if i can help further , please don_'_t hesitate to get in touch .
negative	that driver could have driven one of the other vehicles .
negative	the first engineer was sent out , acknowledged the smell , but could not find where it was coming from .
negative	customer_services was very hard to contact and eventually sent me an_email_telling_me to ring another number , which i did and was then told to ring the first unrecognised number !
neutral	next thing i discover i have been charged_twice on my visa bill .
positive	fortunately i always have an ethernet cable with me when i travel .
neutral	but i '_m afraid i won_'_t be using you ' re service again as i cannot waste more time off work .
neutral	also , the gps system was useless .
negative	she then asked me if i was happy with the outcome , which i was not as it did not sort the problem as i could still not pay off my card and no one from customer service had called me when they said they would , she then told me she could not freeze the interest and my complaint would be sent to another department .
neutral	however we had a nasty surprise when we got to the hotel of an extra £_00 overnight parking charge .
positive	i was recommend this website and it has not let_me down , i will be recommending it to others within my dive_club .
positive	extensive_research led me to muxu or rapha jeans .
neutral	whilst the company have rectified the issues positively it should never have been sent out in this condition .
neutral	this shuttle driver asked us to take the car keys with us and after checking our car for existing damage on a pre_- printed chart , we were asked to sign it but we weren_'_t given a copy .
neutral	spoke with mark the owner a few_times all be it i had to ring him , for progress updates during the delay which in turn ended_up with a full_refund and apology from him .
positive	the products are top quality and reasonably_priced , found on a simple to use website .
negative	i ordered from blackcircles not because they were the cheapest , as they weren_'_t but because they said they could get the tyres to me the next_day and i needed them urgently , only to get a call a few hours_later after it was too late to order elsewhere saying they couldn_'_t and stating what seemed liked a fake excuse ( courier had already left , i think they probably ran_out of stock ).
positive	the site is easy to use .
negative	all in all a really painful experience i will never order with them again and won_'_t be shy about telling others about this treatment .
negative	i give up other channels live and catch up streams are far_superior
positive	very clear , easy site to use .
neutral	easy to do the ordering , i like how you get notified of delivery and kept up to speed , however , the delivery wasn_'_t great . sent some to my mum and the box was literally chucked over her fence into back garden . and my friend didn_'_t receive hers till gone 0pm which i thought was far too late , no wouldn_'_t appreciate someone knocking on my door at that time , kids in bed etc .
negative	i booked and hired a car for 0_weeks in lanzarote , when i got there the car we had booked wasn_'_t available and we were offered a dinky instead and although it says on the contract that you can use a visa for booking it didn_'_t state that a visa_debit is not acceptable at your destination , therefore we could not actually complete our transaction and lost the whole booking and had to go to another ( far more efficient ) company and pay there in full , also we were not told that we must buy our fuel from the rental company prior to taking the car and must purchase extra_insurance that we didn_'_t want .
positive	great value , fast delivery
negative	i took the opportunity to disconnect our old cooker and stick it in the garden .
positive	would highly_recommend this company .
negative	remember you are fully_protected with " visa_debit " cards these days , not just credit_cards !
positive	but this was an easy and quick service .
negative	while waiting for a response to my e_- mail i contacted the customer service by phone i was told i could purchase the size required on - line and pay again and have it delivered to my home address , then for me to go to the store with the correct sized item , invoice and credit_note , the store would then refund me for the delivered product and for me then to purchase back the product with the credit_note .
negative	i suggested that if this was the case , why had we paid so much , and why did they allow us to book with myhermes on thier website .
negative	my order was cancelled without informing_me , so i never received the goods .
negative	further from my recent email , i am sorry for the delay in responding to you .
negative	we booked the harry_potter tour in london , our plane got in a little late so we called the tour office told them this and that we were taking a taxi there .
neutral	but the staff kindly deducted that from the total .
negative	it arrived with no charger .
neutral	dont_think i will use them again

positive	excellent service , product and very competitive_prices .
positive	the power_consumption of my kitchen lighting is now about 00 watts instead of 000_watts .
negative	neither happened .
positive	very helpful .
neutral	just disappointed the shoes were not the same colour , as i had to pay 0 . 00 to return them , so i am out of pocket for an item that was faulty , if the website description had stated one shoe was faded i would never have ordered them .
negative	least a few_pounds more you know you will get what u pay for !
positive	i was also given delivery slot first thing in morning within 0 hours also phone_call from driver to confirm .
negative	so he told me to call again on friday .
negative	£_00 a month for years then no heating or hot_water yesterday so i rang them to arrange a call - out .
negative	they ( or more accurately city_link ) lost my parcel , even_though i had attached a clear , printed address_label sealed under clear packing_tape .
positive	plenty of room so he '_ll get loads of wear out of it .
neutral	my order was acknowledged and dispatched on the day that i placed the order , monday .
neutral	the claim policy is terrible and does not allow ease of use or an acceptable time to make a claim .
positive	i ordered flowers friday_afternoon for saturday delivery , they arrived about dinner time .
neutral	when i agrued the point with them i got an_apology and my money back .
positive	great website , great choice of items and ordering was easy !
negative	good quality products but if anything_goes_wrong with your order then i personally found the person_who dealt_with me to be disrespectful and suffering a god complex .
neutral	however , we still feel that this was sharp_practice by dfds .
positive	the only place which had the fleece i wanted .
negative	on contact with this company initially by phone to a lady we were asked to send photos , so we did .
negative	in essence , they don_'_t have all the key insurance_excess information to hand , therefore tyou are taking a gamble when making a booking ,
positive	well_done wool_company .
negative	!
neutral	delay in delivery , failure to inform_me .
neutral	arrived bang in the middle of the estimated_date range .
negative	the gentleman_who received the box had my invoice details which include my contact number , payment details and home address .

neutral	but it wasnt .
neutral	chocolates were very good quality , very tasty .
neutral	would think_twice before ordering again .
negative	customer service - horrible - they never call you back after agreement is made and you start paying .
neutral	i was tempted to phone him to say ' nothing personal , but you ' re going to have to accept that i am your friend , without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you '.
neutral	given the extra duration of the crossing , the experience is bearable , but not a positive part of the holiday .
neutral	the is especially annoying when the sizing of the products are way out from what is offered and the cost is absorbed by the customer

neutral	it was intensely irritating to receive promotional discounts on seasonal holidays after i had made my ( christmas ) booking , and on ringing , to find out i would not be eligible , since i had already booked and paid , and anyway i had accepted the offer of a christmas_hamper .
negative	made two transactions , paid via cc then to recieve a call to say that there is an extra_charge of over_$_000 !!
negative	however , direct from 0 for instance , and it '_s ' ooooh that '_s prohibited '.
negative	i live in a village and when i got a brand_new phone with their contract they said i live in a strong orange network area what a load of rubbish that was i have to stand by the back door just to get a signal i can '_t get it anywhere_else around the house so i would not recommend orange to any one
neutral	however , the flowers themselves are very unique and once i had sorted them and trimmed the ruined ones so they looked more presentable , they did get lots of comments .

positive	easy online ordering system , fast delivery , great quality product at a excellent price .
neutral	would probably use again .
negative	the voucher_code didn_'_t come off my bill .
negative	if anyone is looking for a really cool costume , go to primark because they have awesome cheap stuff in there and then you can at_least see what you ' re buying and try it on before wasting your money .
neutral	tried to order 0 rolls of 0 paper and 0 of another together but once i got to payment it kept telling_me to start over - so had to order items on 0 orders .
neutral	ok , it was easter , and a last_minute order , so maybe this is partly my fault .
negative	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
negative	they are a scam !!!
positive	other than that delivery time was great and i '_m happy i spent the money on a decent good quality case
neutral	and dont get me started on the ghuy who washes the floor with that machine .
neutral	if you prefer a mild coffee this could suit you very well .
positive	i called to check whether my lenses were in stock as they were in short supply elsewhere .
neutral	it would be better if you could book the extras at the time of booking , saving time when checking your car in .
neutral	wilted flowers which were on deaths door when they arrived .
positive	i do however have a comment regarding being_able to see how full the water_tank is , it is virtually_impossible to see how full the tank is and where the markers are for the litres if somehow this could be improved i would be even more impressed .
neutral	so if you place an order with homebase you have to do all the chasing .
negative	people have not returned calls and it is almost_impossible to get through on the phone !
positive	they not only have a large_selection of supplements but they are at great values .
negative	when i first enquired_about the chair , i was told if i ordered by 0 . pm that day , i would
neutral	on the positive_note , the website is really easy to navigate , the sample service very quick , and delivery quite fast for being made to measure .
positive	the questions i had about the size of the package and estimated delivery time were answered extremely quickly via the live_chat system , and they were very accurate , too .
negative	the management should look back to where they went so wrong .
neutral	i thought that i would try pet_supermarket as i was a customer of vet uk .
negative	she e_- mailed their customer service and was advised that someone would contact her soon .
negative	lucky i paid via_paypal i have asked them to step in and refund me .
neutral	got a cancellation this morning so drove 00_minutes to the garage to be told they are so busy they cannot come out to see the vehicle and i have to book it in for them to look / listen to these problems and then book it in again to get any_problems solved !!!
neutral	obviously with a disabled_person the apartment was our only option and this cost us further taxi fees plus €_00 for the day for a less_than nice apartment .
negative	not ' this brother_dr - 0000 drum_kit .' i told her if it was just the drum it why did it not say ' this brother_dr - 0000 drum_kit .' she kept_repeating herself telling_me i assumed and i should have called to clarify .
positive	on time and did what they promised
positive	it is good to know that our logo is being kept for future orders .

negative	yodel tried to deliver again but with no luck .
neutral	although description gives actual size of stone or earing it is difficult to assess what it looks like on an ear or a neck .
neutral	!
negative	i disagreed but they were very firm .
positive	i have found the pump dispenser toothpaste increasingly_difficult to obtain in the high_street but this was so easy and successful .
neutral	was delivered fairly soon after chasing up .
negative	so i cancelled the order before the end of july .
positive	it is a very sharp knife
neutral	i phoned their help_desk but was first asked if i was " plugging the charger in the correct hole ".
positive	do not_hesitate to use this company i will_definately be doing so soon .
negative	i '_m on maternity_leave and not in a financial position to go out and buy her another gift .
positive	they were delivered in days .
neutral	however , recently_sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .
negative	wednesday 00th demand for final payment has arrived in post obviously this is being ignored until we are fully happy with the office .
neutral	looked ok when received but on further inspection one of the boxes had been dropped on it '_s edge .
negative	i joined first_utility because of their advertising the roll out of ' smart_meters ', two years later and they have now stated that the roll - out is not going to happen . my rate was changed to a different rate without my knowledge and despite providing online meter_readings my bills are still being estimated , attempted to contact them but am getting an_automated_reply_stating ' due to an unprecedented level of interest , responses are taking longer_than usual - we will do our best to respond to your enquiry as quickly as possible .
negative	now , for a start this surprised me as the delivery person had to go down the drive , past the garage ( the door of which was unlocked on that day ), through the back gate which is difficult to unlock , down the garden and into the greenhouse !!
negative	a way that gives clients and customers at home or in businesses the service they want and need .
negative	update !
neutral	normally good experiences but wondering what has happened to some shoes
neutral	the flowers were lovely !
positive	the process was very quick and efficient including payment of funds .
neutral	however , the delivery company that hello_canvas use was awlful !
negative	they not professionals .
negative	truthfully , don_'_t gamble with this firm -- i wish i hadn_'_t .
neutral	villa was very tired looking .
negative	rang and was advised waiting for stock and as soon as they came in they would be sent out .
positive	i spoke to iconic a few_times and they were very helpful and resolved any_issues straight_away .
negative	this tower was fortunately of lowish value but was packaged exactly the same as it was when dhl delivered it to me a year previous and clearly_shows from the box what is inside .
positive	maybe coupon_code usefull
positive	special mentian for christienne who managed the process in an efficient and very professional_manner .
positive	physique always deliver excellent products in extremely quick time .
neutral	also told me they will resolve if not delivered , very helpful
negative	i put in two orders - one for my mother and one for my mother - in - law .
positive	i have used jokers_masquerade for a few_years_now for all my fancy_dress needs and have always been impressed with their efficiency , pricing and availability of products .
neutral	always receive great service yet the amount of damaged to orders by the courier lets then down , never received an order in good condition .
positive	my order was delivered promply .
negative	i will be complaining to amazon us who the parcel is from , to make them aware of what happens when they send a package to the uk .
negative	-- twice only recommending that i get another pair ( did the first time - £_00 . 00 )
positive	from placing an order to receiving the goods , every_step is monitored and i was kept_appraised of every detail .
positive	i sent it to mazuma and got £_00 as agreed with no_issues at all .
positive	simple and very effect to use , the website was a breeze .
positive	it was amazing !
neutral	the flowers were also not as colourful as online .
negative	they then went on and on .
negative	despite already complaining and being promised a follow_up , national_tyres and autocare have still not produced any paperwork to show they actually did anything .
negative	i ordered cottonwood curtains for my patio and bay_windows costing_£ 0 , 000 .
neutral	ordered the peacock outfit for my daughters fancy_dress animal theme birthday_party .
negative	cancelled the order and ordered through someone_else to find that they also use this company .
negative	disgraceful and totally_unacceptable .
negative	the money was taken at the time of order yet even after 0_weeks + there is no sign of it .
negative	you '_ll be seeing them on watchdog soon !
negative	parcel 0 never turned_up and ended_up back at kay '_s 0_weeks_later , parcel 0 the same as parcel 0 both had no delivery attempts .
positive	highly_recommended service !
neutral	' enjoy the show ' text / email was a nice_touch ~ but extortionate booking_fee / admin / postage and vat took price to over_£_000 for 0 £_00 . 00 seats !
negative	had relply from conrad at cex webuy . com today 00th of march at 0 . 00am
positive	their prices were highly competitive and their web_site was easy to use - also their feedback was good so i opted for them over and above slightly cheaper options .
neutral	she shouted that he had hit her bus and should stop or she '_d call the police and generally made a huge commotion .
neutral	received confirmation emails of order accepted , text from courier company advising date of delivery etc so all very good up to this point .
neutral	these two arrived , but i found that one was not adjustable in rotation about its stem - just tilted .
neutral	!
neutral	quickly refunded but would prefer to have the items , rather_than having to go_elsewhere later .
negative	very dissatisfied .
neutral	however the quality of the items is left to be desired .
positive	competitive price too !
neutral	i didn_'_t realise it would be so expensive , my husband is on o0 and was ofgfered a bundle .
positive	excellent service - fast delivery .
neutral	which it did arrive that day .
neutral	one of the items i purchased was a somerset single wardrobe which required assembly .
negative	if you order more than a couple of items , expect problems .
positive	the whole_process of entering requirements , options_available showing up , booking it and paying took less_than 0 minutes .
negative	make of it what you will but to me i can '_t really give them the benefit of the doubt that there isn_'_t something sinister here .
neutral	some are still outstanding and have been for many months .
negative	i was very disappointed , as it was my first purchase from the site .
positive	right from the off very prompt responses with questions fully answered and options presented .
positive	my contact was lee .
negative	!
neutral	still looking_forward to the day what ever the weather .
negative	i feel that this is a disgusting service , i have been with them for 00 years and will have payed them in the region of £_00 , 000 + with my phone and employes .
neutral	so i will be charged or fined for the cancellation which doesn_'_t make any sense since the company cannot keep the price as promised , they shouldn_'_t charge me any penny .
positive	very good product for the money , they also kept me informed at the different stages of the delivery .
negative	received 0 e_-_mails right up to 00 / 00 / 00 advising it would be delivered week begining 00 / 00 / 00 then yesterday received an e_- mail from csl for me to contact them arrange delivery and told the only dates i could have it delivered are 00st , 00nd and 00rd_dec i told them this was over the 00 weeks and was told to check the small_print as they can not always deliver within the 00 weeks ( not what their salesman told me ).
neutral	tele_sales were helpful but promised morning delivery and ended with afternoon slot .
neutral	go - electrical offered the best price for the roberts digital clock radio which i wanted .
neutral	- pool_table and table_tennis added an extra touch
positive	to my shock and horror the insurance was more than the flights put_together because of my treatment !
positive	all my purchases made have been delivered quick and safe .
positive	!
negative	the tickets i wanted were priced at £_00 cheaper each person each leg of journey but not available at purchase .
positive	fast delivery !
negative	guess_what no reply so sent another ' ticket ' later in the day asking for a reply to my earlier ticket .
neutral	the company made good the deficiency in the order , but again , waited 0_days for receipt .
negative	0 .
positive	will_definitely recommend and use again .
positive	love the way the foliage was sprayed gold to match the orange and autumn coloured arrangement .
positive	unbeatable pricewise too .
negative	" sorry_sir , we cannot issue a replacement until the dpd investigation is complete .
negative	be warned some of the tickets that they say are available are not !
neutral	not worth the hassle .
neutral	i can only think that the managers at the airport are so lacking in empathy with their passengers , that they genuinely have no idea how universally outraged we are at this cynical charge .
negative	i will strongly_suggest to choose the delivery with charge if u really want to buy sth here .
neutral	i '_ve only used the service twice and found the turn a round time to get the order processed longer_than_expected .
neutral	collecting the item however was alarming . i followed the click and collect sign which was pointing into a dispatch area with forklift trucks flying about . the sign on the gate said hoot your car horn for assistance which i did and i was beckoned into this industrial area and led into the warehouse . it did not feel a safe_environment for a customer to be and i would suggest relocating the click and collect area .
positive	easy to use , good service plently of choice as the first time ive done this
neutral	i didn_'_t receive any communication from 000 and only received an explanation for the order delay , after asking .
positive	we were booking a hotel in london .
negative	i won_'_t be bothering again .
positive	great selection , great service , best prices , this will be my first stop for the new season
positive	very good service .
positive	!
negative	not available at time of purchase .
neutral	michael_o ' farrell
neutral	there is absolutely no one anywhere to ask for help or advice .
negative	they have hardly been touched yet when we wrote to furniture_market hoping for a replacement , no chance !
positive	in 0_weeks i '_ve lost 00 lbs , 00 to go , i '_m_sure i '_ll do that in the 0 week supply i have left .
neutral	would thoroughly_recommend pay_pal for transactions - it is far and away less_painful !
neutral	ideally i would have liked both the 00_%_off and free delivery , these are two different_types of discounts and should be allowed simultaneously .
positive	cheapest heat mats i could_find online .
positive	so this was the first time i '_d used the chocolate_trading company .
negative	two_weeks_later and bensons hadn_'_t called following this visit - so rang them to ask .
positive	i have one of those big plastic ' shed ' containers in my front_garden , it would be so nice if the postman could leave the parcel tucked_away in there .
neutral	they did eventually accept_responsibility though and refunded my speedy postage_costs .
positive	the complete service was very nice .
negative	update .
positive	i remember using this type of product in the 0000s on a escort mk0 , i searched for a couple of days before i found it then found several people selling exactly the same product .
negative	it is a company with no customer service , no professionalism and definitely no ethics .
positive	excellent product and service
neutral	we have gone with it this time but will be wary next time !
positive	they offered lowest_price , plus free gift .
negative	this stuff , it turns_out , is mechanically separated and when microwaved as per the guidelines , is a battleship grey , slimy , jigsaw of various shapes including half circles .
negative	they simply don_'_t have a concept of customer service .
neutral	i '_m disappointed so wouldn_'_t recommend for that reason .
positive	i would definitely use boiler_juice again as it was quick and easy to order online and i saved money .
negative	i have a booster which is a unlimited to other tmobile users yet my bill is always over .
neutral	the flowers were left on a doorstep and were not discovered until late_afternoon when i rang to check .
negative	he gave_me the impression that they wouldn_'_t entertain it until the five days had passed .
negative	no courier turned_up .
negative	how may people follow_up on if their flowers have been delivered .
negative	it said the booking had gone_through and that i would be receiving a confirmation_email shortly .
neutral	everything completed but confirming payment returned me to home page . customer service wanted to charge £_00 extra for same ticket which i eventually bought for £ 0 extra the next_day .
neutral	finally , i expected vp to provide all of the fittings for their products to connect to the pipework - not so .
negative	only use this company if you ' re desperate .
neutral	the microwave itself seemed to be undamaged and the packaging had done its job .
negative	on top of this they overbook dramatically , they will take however many bookings they can and still claim they '_ll be collected the next_day which sometimes must be a physical impossibility .
negative	perhaps i '_m not working hard enough !
neutral	the packaging of the camera was inadequate and the corner of the camera box was damaged .
neutral	great service from go_electrical
positive	there service is perfect tells when is coming web is easy tell you how much and it the best deals around
negative	i told them to forget it and refund me providing i wouldn_'_t be waiting another 0_weeks for the refund .
positive	if they go on sale , you can see it on your list , so bonus !
negative	however the day after it was dispatched ( so snowing said ) i tried to track it for four days , when i contacted snowing they took days to find out it was lost and by that time it was too late to order elsewhere , very very disappointing for my husband .
positive	i didn_'_t no what to expect really , i bought snowboard clamps because of the review online and thought they ' d be ok , what i got was fast delivery and really good quality clamps that are pride of place on my garage bench !
positive	what more can you ask for !
positive	orders are always well_packaged , staff are polite , friendly and helpful .
negative	update 00 - 00 - 00 -
positive	i found this easy to do and found the items i wanted right away .
negative	i have had a trail of emails with some robotic centre based i know not where you use cut and paste techniques to never fulfil my needs .
positive	!
positive	from this experience to past experiences i have never come_across an issue .
positive	would have no_hesitations about using this company again .
positive	within a few_minutes she had pinpointed the problem to my obvious need for an eye_test since i had incorrectly_entered the postcode - doh !
negative	telling_me that a courier was picking it up soon and a replacement would be produced .
negative	i never received a reply , so i sent another message using this form - again my message went ignored .
negative	your customer service has_been appalling .
positive	i was really pleased with the results , which are apparent almost_immediately .
neutral	all that seems to good to be true usually is too good to be true .
neutral	so initial journey made with basic map from alternate car_hire company , simple information re how car worked would be very helpful as there was no car manual !
negative	had to wait 00hrs before sending back as i needed a return code from partmaster .
neutral	i would say the accessories are better then the outfits .
neutral	poor , abysmal or don_'_t you care anyway
negative	******* dated .
negative	when i did finally hear from you all you did was make excuses and say anything to get out of sending replacement flowers .
positive	great service but this survey is already anoying me .
neutral	on taking it to the post_office i was told this wouldn_'_t cover the postage and had to pay £_00 .
positive	would definately_use again , effecient , good value and speedy !
negative	they tried to deliver whilst i was at work , without telling_me and expected that someone was at home to sign for it .
negative	basically , the thing never worked .
positive	ordered two waistcoats and had to exchange as i ordered too small but this was easy and customer_services were lovely .
positive	i was very surprised that the package arrived so early - within a couple of days of placing the order .
positive	we tried a four wheeled rollator which was fine in the house and in town where it was smooth but useless elsewhere and had to be lifted over kerbs and door threshholds , not the best for someone without balance .
neutral	.
negative	i felt very upset .
neutral	the lace top is cropped which is a major disappointment and the corset is velcro !
neutral	i used twice the service of booking . com and from customers point of view all was good .
positive	i was notified of all_stages of the processing and delivery via_email .
negative	csl seem to be ignoring the sale of goods_act , in that the product should be " fit for purpose ".
negative	car_park exit - faulty .
neutral	a pity i was not informed as i knew the package had to be signed for and had waited in for 0_days !
neutral	great example of terms and conditions : " we will process your order and not pass any of your details to nobody , after 0 months we also delete all your details from our systems .
neutral	they have delivered our orders to addresses the other end of the country to where they are supposed to be , lost packages completely and left goods unsigned for out in the rain .
negative	this has_been the fourth and fifth time that yodel have let_me down .
negative	i am also extremely annoyed by my employer who has this company on their staff offers site - did they not check iflorist out first ?
positive	keep_up the good work .
positive	would i buy another vehicle from jennings_ford ?
negative	i can '_t be_bothered to waste further time on this company by writing a lengthy review so i will just say this : horrendous !
positive	cheapest on net , delivery was super_fast , really pleased .
neutral	i got one phone_call on the last_week of january to say it would be delivered the following week and would arrive on the tues 0 or wed_0th .
positive	staff very friendly and deal with enquiries fast and efficient , will not_hesitate to recommend .
neutral	the picture_shown was completely_different to how the flowers actually turned_out .
negative	i don_’_t know much about pc ’_s so i used their remote page to identify my memory type and bought same in good faith .
positive	haven_'_t been buying supplements in about a year and a half , and have moved to the uk from ireland so unsure as to where to buy from .
positive	would recommend to anyone !
negative	each time some incorrectly delivered we then had to wait two_weeks for the correct ones to come .
neutral	the container did not burst_open due to an impact but rather it simply leaked through an inadequate screw on cap .
neutral	if the kit holds up well i will probably consider ordering again -- long before the chinese new year !
negative	when order came , driver wanted me to sign before he had taken the goods off the lorry without_any inspection .
neutral	they do offer good value products in most_cases but i feel they punish their suppliers to enable this .
neutral	contact from them would have eliminated all of this
neutral	on the plus_side the customer service is very good , they are very keen to look after you if there is a problem , so at_least there is some redemption on this occasion .
positive	i would highly_recommend you give them a try as i will be buying again and at the discounted_prices i dont have to limit myself to 0 new pair every 0 years .
positive	( it must be easy if i managed it !)
negative	i queried this charge on the form and he denied it applied to us , and encouraged us to sign quickly .
positive	.
neutral	so be warned ; you may have to wait longer for your order than you '_ve been told .
negative	eventually yesterday morning we rang at 0am and spoke to a very pleasant lady in sales ( customer_services don_'_t open until 0am ).
neutral	it was accepted that the website was misleading and assurance was given that the website pictures would be changed .
neutral	quality item though - glossy and well made !
negative	email today offering me a different bracket - they must have seen my original review .
negative	the new myspace
positive	the pills i bought were posted on the same day and reached me in a day .
negative	i ordered a nokia_lumia_000 on the 00 august .
neutral	michelle at holiday please was fantastic .
neutral	at last the third item arrived , about a month or more after the first .
negative	i tried to buy the argos_voucher and at first it kept coming up saying i had already bought the offer , then i got an_email_saying i had left an item in my basket and when i went to look it was in my basket but with zero again how many i wanted .
positive	no_problems .
negative	i took a screenshot .
positive	bought a ceiling rose from this company .
negative	the phone was in perfect_condition and well_packaged .
neutral	the man who came was fantastic .
neutral	sent me the wrong_colour shoes !
negative	now i see you for what you really are .
negative	i would never ever use this company !
negative	the flowers were delivered as promised and they were nothing like the flowers described on the website .
neutral	the cost for 0 adults ( after adding all the taxes which get added to the basic price ) was £_000 . 00 each .
negative	now we get constant phone_calls and harassment letters for a £_000 uplift fee of the tank even_though we have had several conversations to say that it is free as the new gas supplier supplied own tank as per instructions on the terms and conditions on the back of flo - gas letters .
neutral	it didn_'_t stipulate that the photo had to be bright .
positive	i found the swatch_strap i was looking for - completed the order without_any problem and couldn_'_t_believe it when the next_day it dropped through the letter_box in perfect_condition !
neutral	eventually tried another exit lane , had same problems .
positive	the delivery driver was very polite and helpful too .
positive	just as if i '_d had the thought about it , and then the products magically arrived .
negative	they will not park your car in a secure place .
negative	left over a hundred passengers stranded in bologna ( or rather at forli - over an_hour away from bologna - with no access to taxis , buses or hotels available ).
neutral	really !
positive	found the service very quick and items arrived well_packaged .
positive	send anything you like and they give you cold hard cash or vouchers .
negative	i gave up on the mug because it kept distorting the image and the person on the live_chat couldn_'_t help ( i ordered a mug from moonpig instead which took 0 min to do ).
negative	just annoying this company !
positive	easy to create and loved the result .
positive	i got prompt_replies when trying to order my new ram which i really appreciated .
negative	now i feel that they have lost these simple roots in their desperation for growth .
neutral	for complaining , and for inconvenience , i got a discount .
neutral	i have my fingers_crossed !
positive	would strongly_recommend
positive	well_done .
neutral	the catch is you only get free delivery if it is left to their discretion and we were told it could be up to a month , whereas if we paid £_00 we could have the order the following week .
neutral	the main_reason_why i '_m not so dissapointed is that we had no snow in romania during that time of the year :).
positive	then i wouldn_'_t need to shop anywhere_else .
negative	they caused me so much stress and upset .
neutral	website seems packed full of really cool_stuff !
negative	purchased a radiator through ring and reserve .
neutral	want email contact details for breakers not premium phone no which i wont ring
negative	limit your money over anything . so they can earn interest on it . avoid
neutral	i '_m in the uk and they sent me an eu dc adapter , and also a uk_plug ( unwired ).
neutral	i am just glad that i hadn_'_t actually spent £_00 on them , didn_'_t expect them to be delivered in a cardboard_box they were also disappointingly small and just less that 00_hours , the roses and gerbera '_s are wilting and the lilies don_'_t look like they ' re even going to open !
positive	ordered item at 0 . 00pm , it was on my doorstep at 0 . 00am the following_morning .
neutral	chair was quickly delivered and exactly as_described .
positive	i haven_'_t ordered from them before but found just what i was looking for on their website .
negative	i have contacted them on a number of occasions and only got a standard reply back , my husband rang them and asked for the money to be refunded , which they did not do ????!!!!
neutral	items generally turn_up when expected , sometimes a bit bashed though and their own delivery drives can be a bit moody .
negative	we then had to drive home with the spare_tyre on at 0 . 00am in the morning , and spend the rest of the day sorting_out a new tyre and the other issues .
neutral	now i know i will shop more
neutral	the only_reason i expect quick delivery is becuase i can get all the items ordered from my fav ebay in a quicker time .
negative	my bank is now dealing_with these thief '_s .
negative	i very much hope that uk sports_imports had a good christmas because ours was completely_ruined !
negative	!
positive	really pleased with my purchase and would use again in the future
positive	tried them on straight_away and couldn ` t stop laughing .
positive	also a very good price .
positive	great taste and mixes_well , unlike_some others i '_ve had before .
negative	i order labels for my daughter last_year and was very clear to inform that i needed them before school starts .
neutral	i would suggest to future customers you order stuff as early as possible so you can check quality and make returns if_necessary . in plenty of time .
positive	this vacuum_cleaner makes the dyson look and feel agricultural .
negative	or michael fans .
negative	i came to halfords_autocentre for a free brake and engine checks and got my vehicle back in messy condition : some of wheel_bolts wasn_'_t tight enough , engine cables were loose and not on the right place , an engine and around it was dirty .
neutral	i contacted customer_services who did respond quite quickly and following a couple of emails did refund the additional delivery charge .
positive	so i think i will have to buy another couple !
neutral	i purchased this small item and found the cost of the item was reasonable but the postage was far to high for such a small item making the overall cost far to expencive , it also thought it took a bit to long to arrive for the cost charged .
positive	completing paperwork is good ; let '_s hope the chaffeur is there when we arrive .
negative	then i thought i '_ll give them another chance and order a cross_trainer .

negative	however you booked the order with yodeldirect and we have not been contacted to ask for the item to be returned .
neutral	i then contacted them to ask whether holdup would go on ad infinitum .
neutral	good variety of parts , but i begin to wonder_if we are becoming a victim of a monopoly , as recently the offers seem less favorable and lbs level of service cannot by the nature of mail order be provided .
neutral	the item is sold as adjustable but without instructions i have no idea how it works .
neutral	however , a major_issue developed with regard to delivery .
neutral	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
negative	both failed to be delivered on time and end up arriving late by up to 0 days .

positive	well_done bt .
positive	the deals are second to non to the point where you think they carnt be making money off them .

negative	ordered a beautiful bunch of flowers for my friend , the bunch she received looked nothing like the bunch i paid for .
negative	very hungry
negative	i am totally confused as to why you have sent me flowers ?
negative	i myself have come from a customer_services background and i '_d be so embarrassed if that was how my company dealt_with their customers .
negative	so_far so good but my purchase hasn_'_t been delivered yet ?
negative	we were lucky in that we ordered only one item , if you bought several things from them it could take you months to get the entire order .
negative	ordered the peace bouquet and had them sent to my mother as a gift as i could not travel to her_birthday .
positive	helen took all of our information and said to leave it with her and that she would get back to me .
positive	this company comes with the highest reccommendation possible .

positive	speed_graphic have good availability and offer competitive_prices .
positive	we just bought 0x 0 mtr lengths ( 00mm_thick ) of oak_worktop from worktop_express - the price was really competitive and they offered a good range to choose from .

neutral	excellent comparison website for ferries .
positive	very quick delivery , very good service .
positive	ordering was easy , we were kept up to date with delivery and what we got is what we ordered !
negative	a terrible customer experience with awful customer service - avoid at all costs !
neutral	would not of ordered if i had know customer pays for return postage !
positive	kept_upto_date with progress of order
negative	of course this isn_'_t recognised and you can '_t get past this stage to speak to someone .
negative	in their email they wrote that they ' upgraded ' me to the next_day delivery .
positive	true to your word , even_though it was free delivery they received the flowers bright and early the next_day .
neutral	i am going to see one direction in may and booked the tickets in january we have paid £_000 for 0 tickets my friend booked them though but i am not sure if they are real as i am a massive directioner and the first concert i have ever gone to .
negative	they are now supplying electricity but not gas .
positive	my bag arrived in perfect_condition and much to the envy of others at the club !
positive	other_companies could take_note from kwik_fit '_s customer - centred approach .
positive	thought of selling on ebay but after looking at the prices decided to go for mazuma , guaranteed prices with no_hassle of uploading_pictures or worries of will it sell .
negative	this was quietly admitted to us in what was probably the 00th email exchange between us and four different members of their support_team ( most of whom are very friendly and genuinely seem to want to help , it must be said ).
positive	excellent service .
neutral	also i noticed that the grille on the front of the amp had a dent in it .
negative	i did not even know dpd did that as i have never had anything delivered by them .
neutral	too early to comment as i am only 0 days into a 0k tub .
negative	as it is , there is no way i will ever use this company again .
negative	from ordering to completing was several weeks .
positive	an excellent service
negative	and thats where they are identical to other uk companies .
neutral	the southampton office was efficient , the staff pleasant and helpful .
negative	nope , ordered a pmdg product on tuesday , and now its saturday , still no game or no notification on where the game is .

neutral	overall i would rate 0 / 00

neutral	ankle_support unwearable as hard strap under heel
negative	this consistently comes last in group tests for anti_virus_software .
negative	i would suggest to others to physically take them to a trade - in place and accept or reject an offer on the spot in person so you can walk_away with your goods in your possession if they ' re unhappy with the condition rather_than being robbed blind as i have !!
negative	please have a look at [_external_reference_]
negative	at the end of week 0 , i emailed fv to ask where my order was as it was late and i '_d had no contact from them at all .
negative	and still they show as i '_m writing this as being in stock .
positive	cheaper_than retailer and they wanted to charge £_00 . 00 for a special order charge . e_mails all along the delivery chain .
negative	things went_downhill from there on in , taking over two_weeks till i received the correct order !
positive	the worktops are very good quality and look lovely in my new_kitchen / utility .
positive	i got a phone_call within minutes of placing the order ( on a sunday ) then i was kept up to date by text and email right up until 00_minutes before delivery .
positive	a great range of stuff at low_prices and quick delivery .
positive	ordering was easy adn delivery was prompt .
positive	the experience from_start to finish was superb i did not at any time feel as though i was a back seat passenger i felt at all times in control with regular_updates as to what was happening and when .
neutral	however of late the company is constantly_updating their products and the new models are unrliable and so becoming too expensive to continue with .
negative	on the phone again , they send another engineer who actually fixes the laptop .
negative	refused to refund me till items were returned to them via their courier ( even_though i never actually recieved them !!!!!)
negative	they still think we all use internet_explorer !
positive	the whole_process was easy to follow , no_hassle , the booking process was easy to follow , tickets arrived quickly and the hotel booking was seamless .
negative	i then had to transfer to the enterprise desk and wait there while my booking was being_processed .
neutral	so the recipient of the flowers had no idea who they were from which was very disappointing
neutral	it was almost like the email had already been written in anticipation of a ‘ failed ’ delivery .!
neutral	the roots were exposed and in the end the whole_thing had to be replanted .
neutral	was told " by 0pm " and given the number for the delivery company .
positive	my order arrived the next_day what better service could you get !
negative	we noted that in section six of the user agreement the advertiser makes clear that they charge a fee for their part if setting_up the service and that if a job is cancelled the fee is returned as credit which must be used within six_months .
neutral	sad that recipient did not know who flowers were from
neutral	although the flowers were nice they did not match the picture on the web_site .
negative	the following_monday i phone shopto in the morning and am told that they are waiting for dpd to confirm that the parcel is indeed missing and they will get me a replacement out that same day .
negative	i was told i had an_email_telling_me the times .
neutral	i did an order , although assistant did not seem to know what was going on .
neutral	top quality .
positive	printerland '_s service was excellent !
positive	thank_you tanja ( and chris )
positive	not wrong as process to sell very easy and straight_forward .
negative	despite having an ann_summers in my area , i thought i would save myself some time by ordering online for my first valentines with my boyfriend .
negative	having tried a couple of other placed to be told the 0 drawer set was out of stock i tried this company .
positive	i cannot_rate this firm highly_enough for service and products at a rate that is very reasonable !
negative	additionally i was charged for items that were out of stock !
negative	what a shame .
neutral	they had no intentions of resolving my issue either !
negative	that was at 0000 am and by 00 am he had posted a cheque to the company , immediately upon his return home .
negative	despite the fact that banff is in mainland britain and lies equal distance between inverness and aberdeen , 0 of scotlands largest cities !
negative	unhappy customer .
positive	very helpful and friendly team .
neutral	perhaps i should have waited to write this once my rug has_been safely collected !
negative	for them to tell me they are sorting it out to with the driver .
positive	i will be purchasing again from this company .
positive	i am ( was ) short_sighted and on the recommendation of optimax only had one eye done , this means that i can still read at short distances plus have near perfect long_distance_vision . i have a slightly iffy distance of around 00 cm but you get used to that .
neutral	so to some it all up i ' d say that the website is great yet the product needs refining .
neutral	but if other_companies offer significantly more i might risk sending my expensive phone to some random company and cross my fingers that they don_'_t just steal it .
positive	thankyou for a trustworthy service !
positive	order completed and received within 0_days .
negative	the we get a letter from ( name ) saying that they wanted to cancel the contract and give us a refund due to us not being abl to take delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 when we are out of the country .
negative	three_weeks plus now .
neutral	she sent me a photo of the flowers and i noticed the roses had been replaced by canterbury bells and the whole effect was not the same !
positive	for some reason you do not get foam bath or bath salts , only shower_gel and shampoo .
positive	have been buying from gjw_titmus for a few_years_now and can only recommend .
positive	what can i say , the right tuxedo in the right size ( that most_places do not stock !!
positive	this was my first experience of dotty_hippo but i '_m_sure it won_'_t be the last .
negative	of the make and model of the phone so i happily gave this information .
negative	not an easy feat !
positive	i would highly_recommend as service excellent and delivered next_day at no extra_cost .
positive	so easy . website . post . money in my account . fantastic !
neutral	that is a big mark up and i was given no warning of this at point of purchase .
neutral	good price and they stocked the part i needed but felt the delivery was slow .
negative	will opt to buy in b_& q in future .
neutral	once booked the service is great .
neutral	the goods were dispatched immediately and arrived the day after ordering , and considering i live on an island , this was very quick service .
positive	i have been viewing this nascar resource for the last few_years , and have never had any_problems viewing there website , or questioning the integrity of the information supplied on there .
positive	delivery could have been a little quicker but i did order at weekend so that probably added a couple of days
positive	once fitted it warmed our ( medium_sized ) kitchen in a few minutes on the 0kw setting .
positive	great helmet ( quiksilver ) at excellent price with prompt delivery .
neutral	overall t mobile have offered a good reliable service , with good coverage over most of the uk , however they do seem prone to changing their price structure at the drop of a hat , and their contact number has also changed .
neutral	cost to return too high so i am stuck . not sure if i will order again because of this .
neutral	?
neutral	the man then told me i previously had the wrong tyres on the vehicle as they were 000 and they should be 000 , strange as the vehicle handbook says both are suitable .
negative	i ordered a pair of ray - ban glasses with my prescription in them .
positive	wonderful !
negative	your prices may be cheaper , but your customer service is incredible , or sorry total_lack of i should say .
positive	very good service .
neutral	however , on the day before fitting the garage sent an email confirmation of the appointment but on the day their tyre machine wasn_'_t working ( and hadn_'_t been the previous day ).
negative	back in the post - let '_s hope it '_s 0rd time lucky for this lacklustre bunch of amateurs .
positive	really enjoying how easy it is to sell things , great community .
negative	constantly fobbed_off with , " oh it '_s due in stock in early april ", then the same for may and june .
neutral	seems a little silly to publish the process online if you don_'_t follow it . still_waiting for someone to call me back re my telephone query which is now redundant . ah well poor customer service such as this is normal these days it would seem .
negative	rang in and was told that someone would ring me me back to confirm but not to worry as they offer like for like replacements .
positive	highly_reccomend them .
neutral	so not that impressed this time .
neutral	a waste of mine and their money !
positive	however i was also told that i needed to make_sure that the beginning of the print started at the beginning of each box .
negative	i love ann_summers products and we have spent alot with them over the years but i wont_be shopping with them again , the customer service is getting worse and the returns process is just too long !
negative	i received the refund later that day but without a refund for the return postage .
neutral	they were apologetic and got the right trophy to mean pretty quickly .
positive	i have bought from cheapsmells on many occasions now & i can_honestly_say i have always had 000_% service .
neutral	this is the second time i have used seranta even the first time was bad but i thought i would try again but i will not use them ever again .
negative	i was going to write a letter of complaint to your chairman and send it by recorded delivery .
neutral	eventually got paid out though , but it was quite a wait .
positive	i ordered a bookcase online and from_start to finish oak_furniture_land have been brilliant .
positive	totally committed 0 satisfy the customer and they also price matched my items without_any fuss would definetly purchase from here again
neutral	overall , this would be ok for a 00 year_olds birthday treat - not the burthday of a 00 yer old business man .
neutral	. the zip on the bag was broken !!
neutral	envirofone bought my phone the only thing i had to wait along time for payment
neutral	i spent extra to get a larger bunch of flowers and although the box was massive , the flowers were not .
negative	never have they taken any responsibility for the situation , blaming in turn the supplier , someone_else in the shop and sometimes even me .
positive	delighted with my watchfinder experience .
neutral	the confusion is mainly_because i know that a set of 00 rollers is retails between £_00 to £_00 and the hairspray and brush are not worth that much .
neutral	the only reason i have marked them down is because of the missing items , the meat received is great though .
negative	i promptly packaged them up and returned them to uttings .
positive	payment sense is very recommended , the set_up was extremely easy and painless , kevin torres answered all questions with much patience , and talked_me through the process and set_up with ease .
positive	i really liked this website , very easy to use and order and delivery was timely - wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use again :-)

positive	once we had ordered , it was sorted , despatched and delivered very quickly .
positive	0000000
negative	the suggested remedies had no relevance to feet on the monitor whatever , mentioning drivers etc !
positive	class .
negative	wont be using again - would far rather pay the high prices for deliverence with much_better service levels if i find myself in a cashless situation again .
negative	bt have disconnected me after one week of using the internet from bt_infinity :/ and after apart of taking from by direct_debit 0000 gbp as cancelation charges , offered me reconnection after 0 weeeks !!!!
neutral	i stayed in the following_day and no amp arrived !
negative	i emailed the store to complain and say i would keep the cd_player , as it seemed to work , if i could have a small refund back due to their listing error and sending me a cheaper model .
neutral	he simply said i should have pushed in to the head of the small queue outside the tiny office .
neutral	no_frills just fill in and go .
neutral	normally buy toiletries as they sell top brand at a lot less .
negative	go somewhere_else , you only have yourself to blame if you choose vodafone .
positive	i '_m_sure the grandparents will be thrilled !
neutral	we had 0 on transfer from and back to airport .
positive	virtually knew what we wanted in the french_farmhouse range and had gone to milton_keynes branch for a final choice .
positive	we used carpark and hotel package and the value was fantastic .
neutral	it '_s great but it takes_ages and the estimated payment date keeps moving further and further away , i '_ve had one claim denied unfairly and this has done my opinion for the company involved great damage !

positive	couldn_'_t ask for better service .
positive	i was sceptical at first , but i '_m glad to say i was pleasantly_surprised by how good panamoz was .
neutral	she said no so i knew that they had not been delivered yet .
neutral	items are great and delivery so quick but leave me alone !
negative	now for a variety of reasons including exposed cabling and router in the hall , dissatisfaction with tv offering and the fact that our smart_tv offered an equivalent service we decided to return the tv box and ask that we return to our old package of tv and broadband with the contract ending in a few_months .
positive	would check this website first if i need something_else .
neutral	she then told me that the delivery company had lost it and it would have to be delivered the next_day instead .
negative	i assembled the kit and , when i couldn_'_t get it running tried to get help .
neutral	compared to other online services i have used , this was slow and annoying .
positive	i absolutely love shopto . net .
positive	like most on - line buyers our first_port of call was ebay .
positive	excellent service and excellent piece of kit , very impressed
positive	prices are the lowest on the web and delivery fast and no cost .
neutral	i went back and started again , and again , but couldn_'_t see how free delivery , seemingly ineviitably , became a charge of £ 0 . 00 !
positive	a really great range of products at really good prices .
neutral	saturday comes and still no delivery - i call them on saturday_afternoon but there was no - one in customer_services to speak to , so a message was left for them to call me on monday .

neutral	no , not all drugs are the same , and some have better results than others .
neutral	im a bit disappointed .
negative	after you cancel your service ( they put the prices up and invited me to cancel ' without charge ') i still seem to be getting billed for a ' contract breakage fee '.
positive	although a complex subject to us mere mortals , it was made easy by the professionalism and information provided by omar mesbahi .
positive	the quote , proof and confirmation of order was quick and straight_forward , dispatch advice useful and the delivery was on time .
negative	( someone had crossed out the manufacturers printed size and handwritten another ) i called their call_centre to advise i was sending the item back and was referred to the website for their company returns information .
neutral	they did not deliver on the promised day , even_though i had paid for next - day delivery .
neutral	other than that i could not find any fault with athol vehicle hire

neutral	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
positive	simply excellent !
neutral	maybe in this case judging_by the hidden problems with the phone , but mazuma never asked about them .
neutral	in fact , the whole_process could be shortened by reacting quickly , especially when i mentioned i expected the funds to arrive before a certain_date ( deadline ).
positive	many_thanks
neutral	not companies fault but i have had better from local_florists .
positive	the lenses were excellent , but one had split , i contacted customer service via_email & there response was to send both contact_lenses back with a full_refund , i am a really happy customer who would certainly recommend this company !
positive	the great thing is that they do the searching for you on all the big sites which means its one search not several .
positive	i bought a xlarge size for two reasons although it is a bit long for my height ( nb i am male ):
negative	we recently got our bedroom furtniture done from them . and everything from_start to end was crap / incorrect / below standard .
positive	however you have sent the customer feedback to the delivery customer , not myself , who actually placed the order on my payment card .

positive	hope it continues to strive for the best available health and well being products :_o_)
negative	its the fact i am still_waiting to hear from them that is totally_unacceptable and once ( or should i say if ) my problem gets sorted i will be sending in a complaint to the company about very poor customer service , no_doubt it will take them weeks to send me a bog_standard ' sorry ' email .
positive	the items arrived very quickly and were as_described .
positive	our dog has barked on meeting other dogs since he was a puppy .
negative	absolutely_shocking the amount of time it has taken them to admit this and to still be taking orders and peoples money knowing they would / could not deliver .
neutral	this was opened shortly_after i had surgery .
neutral	was hoping for a wow_factor , but it didn_'_t happen .
negative	the reviews here do not reflect the company i and many others have been dealing_with .
positive	since i found british_corner_shop my life in italy is even better .
negative	as for compensation ?
positive	many_thanks !
positive	ordered it , arrived 0 days_later in the post .
positive	will definitely recommend to all our friends & family .
neutral	so i ordered it & it came , nice & shiny & new but no insert !!!
positive	and from the time of ordering up to time of despatch she was
negative	well , i made the same mistake , not once , but twice , will i never learn .
neutral	that did not happen in my case , i was just sent emails that panicked me , if i knew that was all i needed to do it could have been done in hours rather_than days
negative	deal with this company at your_peril .
positive	high_street_shops all said 0 - 0_weeks so i was in great doubt when they said they could deliver in the 0_weeks that we had left .
negative	i had the tyre inspected by a independent tyre_fitting company ( ruislip tyres ) who told me the old valves were not replaced & had failed .
positive	brilliant !
neutral	i might be wrong on this but i dont ' think so .
positive	great service today from emily at online_chat , who handled my issue in a pleasant and professional_manner
positive	peter scarff , the representive of key , visited us twice .
neutral	why not offer paypal as an_alternative payment_method .
negative	i have not been offered a refund and i feel like my complaint has not been taken_seriously or accepted by this company , my advice would be to please_avoid_disappointment and go elsewhere and i shall make_sure i pass this information on to all i come into contact with in the future .
positive	good speedy service at reasonable prices , keep it up .
neutral	kitchen rather shabby , with no facility for storage of non cold food .
negative	i ordered flowers at 0 . 00 . later at 00 . 00 i discovered i had sent the wrong delivery address .
positive	the drivers were friendly and helpful and the washing_machine was a great price .
neutral	i '_m a naturopath & acupuncturist .
neutral	i would have felt better if it just said what it is from the get go .
positive	we would recommend point000 to anyone .
positive	would definitely use them again .
negative	absolute_joke !
positive	see above for more info ;-)
positive	no_fuss , no bother .

positive	axminster are brilliant , everything you would ever need for your workshop in one place .
positive	no_hassle , just plain quick deliverly .
negative	avoid buying from this company at all costs .
positive	i recieved the boxes i ordered in perfect_condition , and got to work organising my work room , i am delighted with them .
neutral	please be careful when sending in your phones !
neutral	the pressure to take higher insurance premium is not necessary and is time_consuming , it is accepted that people should understand what they are getting .
positive	the phone case itself is superb quality also , very sturdy .
negative	total usless service , definatelly the worst service from any company i have dealt_with yet . steer_well clear of them .
neutral	or people that need to work and use the ferry and their firm doesn_'_t pay the fare . this cost of the service is crippling to people and some should put some thought into a fair service . i try hard to visit my grandchildren as often as possible but the cost is proving to much and will limited how often i can now go over .
negative	this does not give me any confidence in their service what so ever .
positive	used cartridge_shop for the first time , wanted some good value inks for my epson r000 printer .
negative	a big hole where a once working radio was with the bracket bent beyond_repair ( i was told that removal of bracket would take two minutes not an_hour ).
neutral	unfortunately the bunch arrived with lilies and geraniums and more foliage than advertised , all of which my mother tends to dislike about bunches of flowers .
neutral	the service is fast , affordable , reliable .
neutral	i had to untie it , trim the ribbon and re - tie it nicely .
positive	excellent and prompt service .
negative	placed order on 00th_june for dog flap .
positive	did exactly_what they said they would do . thats a bit of a rarity_these days .
neutral	not heard_anything by 0th workind day on first order , so sent e_- mail , on 0th working day sent further e_- mail , to be told , both orders had been shipped together and would arrive the following_day , by courier , and postage for the first order was refunded , by way of an_apology ( still don_'_t know why first order was delayed ).
neutral	not yet received order
neutral	the product looks good too .
positive	i would recommend 000_% .
positive	no problem this or previous times on orders for our first_aid stocks or cat treatments .
positive	thx
neutral	i had been sent two tickets instead of one which didn_'_t really matter to me , but did it mean that someone_else lost out ?
negative	i then sent to mazuma and they paid full price (£_000 ) with absolutely no_quibble .
neutral	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused . after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back . money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
neutral	company only seemed interested in delivering as many sales as possible in one day with little thought to the health and safety of customers .
neutral	0 lilies - 0 was broken off .
neutral	when this was delivered it was still not similar enough so in the end we drove to gloucester with an off cut of the right work_surface so they could match it .

neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of neoprene shorts ( 0 . 0 mm and 0 . 0 mm ) in size youth .
negative	never again .
neutral	so wednesday_afternoon i rang again .
positive	a really good online shopping_experience .
negative	agreed that the item must not be sent for a courier deliver monday as was needed saturday and they completely_ignored and sent as a monday courier delivery - absolute fools .
neutral	but to be fair , beautiful_flowers at the end .
negative	i will not be using them again and i will ensure that i make other people aware that customer service was very poor .
negative	thanks , if you made it this far .
neutral	i put a bit back on when my husband was ill and have decided to undertake another vlcd to shirt the weight again .
positive	so glad we done it now

positive	!
positive	i sent my phone and within days the money was in my bank , excellent
negative	only god_knows when ill get the others .
neutral	the not so good now , they didn_'_t send the email_confirmation straight_away , the login process and access your data for the itinerary is poor quality ( gives no info !)
neutral	the 0 items i ordered from elc all arrived on time and as i ' d no clear timeline for this item i went_ahead and built the climbing_frame for my son '_s birthday and then subsequently had to dismantle the ladder to fit this cover only a day later .
neutral	after_researching the part that i needed on the internet i decided to order from discounted heating .
negative	asked police , information and other_vendors in the airport but no joy .
positive	excellent purchase .
negative	one item was a mouse - very cheap , packaging wasn_'_t great , but it arrived working and in decent condition .
positive	the package arrived on christmas_eve , less_than 00_hours after i had made my online order .
neutral	their customer_services team is either very rude , don_'_t care or totally get things wrong .
negative	i should have ordered from amazon instead .
neutral	you do not have to have it and this time it cost me more than the hire itself .
negative	it seems the manufactures don_'_t make the model any more , so why is it still listed as being ' in stock '.
positive	after_placing my order , i wanted to change something , so i phoned up and amended my order with minimum hassle .
neutral	was told that should be fine no_problems waited in all day thursday no delivery checked web link again same problem postcode not recognised phoned up all i got was should arrive by 0pm latest but with no cat_food left thats not good enough .
neutral	i am happy with my product and would consider_using beautybay again .
neutral	i saw the bunch a few_days_later and was not impressed very ordinary not like the usual bouquets i have sent to her from you in the past .
positive	just totally delighted with the photobook i ordered .
neutral	the lady apologised and proposed to put the extra money i paid into the flowers .

positive	as they are very quick at sending goods out .
neutral	i did use buy back but with parking cost of £ 0 . 00 was it worth the purchase ?
positive	great gear great service and follow_up , no_hassles whatsoever .
positive	everyone so helpful .
neutral	in short ," good service but extremely slow ".
positive	i would definitely recommend walls & floors for their great range and great prices .
positive	removal company did an amazing job .
positive	we were kept up to date on order and delivery time , and plaque received by speedy overseas delivery .
positive	absolutely_thrilled with my new glasses and i '_m ready in case summer decides to bring us any sun this year .
negative	ordered a riedel sommeliers single_malt_whisky crystal glass ( height : 000mm 0 0 / 0 "), arrived quickly within 00 hr after the email notification .
negative	the cartridge sent didn_'_t work .
neutral	i guess that '_s their strategy to attract customers .
neutral	i have placed 0 orders with wbn to date , 0 of which where processed speedily and were exactly_what i needed .
positive	superb service !!!
negative	today is the 00 . 00 . 0000 - i guess i will not be enjoying a cup of coffee any time soon !
neutral	since the delivery bit offers the option ' be patient ' i was shocked to discover that she only found the flowers late in the afternoon when a neighbour spotted them and knocked on the door to alert her to their delivery .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use again due to lack of communication .
positive	the phones were still collected though !
neutral	the first rug arrived and i was happy enough with it so decided then to order the larger_size - which at £_00 . 00 was priced quite a bit higher than the ones in my local shop - although they didnt stock the colour i wanted .
neutral	stark contrast - hence returned to 0nd shop since for further items .
neutral	therefore , i had to contact them to find out if it had gone though or not ant destroyed my confidence in their booking system .
negative	the flower arrangment i ordered was a casket arrangment for my mum '_s funeral .
positive	awesome .
negative	still nothing .
negative	when you transfer_funds from a bank_account to paypal it says it takes 0 - 0_days but always takes seven and sometimes longer .
neutral	all seems ok with cover but leaving tomorrow and no printed copy .
positive	all in all a very pleasant_experience !
negative	why does my phone struggle to even get 0g ?
positive	a first_class service .
negative	have ordered meat a few_times and quality has_been fine - particularly_like the chicken_breasts .
positive	excellent price , good delivery time .
negative	april .
negative	but if i had accepted this order i would have got 0 inferior bottles .
positive	very impressed overall and definitely will use them again .
positive	very happy with my first order .
positive	however this was completely_unfounded - i collected the tickets from the collection_point with no_issues , there were no queues and the person working there was extremely friendly and polite .
negative	when internet booking was relatively new , there might have been an excuse for this .
positive	we contacted ao . com immediately and they offered us a choice of money off or a new replacement asap .
neutral	the flat was clean and functional but we did feel it lacked personality .
negative	i am settling via visa claimback .
positive	the website was very easy to use and the products came promptly once ordered .
positive	you can access the policy on the web and print it off there and then straight after paying before going into your email .
neutral	i explained that there was always someone here so he said i '_d need to sort it out with the delivery company . he said ring the no .
neutral	certain items will carry a surcharge to offshore and certain north scotland locations .
negative	i purchased something over 0yrs_ago from them not a phone and i certainly didnt give them my phone number i am registered with tps , so why are they harassing me . never in a million years would i buy even a earphone from them now
negative	i wrote a further complaint entitled " for the attention of management " i finally got a note back saying they '_d given me £_00 credit on my account as " a gesture of goodwill ".
neutral	sent my phone undamaged and when it arrived the screen was broken so even_though it was not my fault my payment went down from £_00 to £_00 .
neutral	we '_d already placed an order for the matching telephone table .

positive	we have quantum ' ed a number of are own vehicles and can see the change in both power and effeciancy .
positive	was the 0st time i had transferred money abroad .
positive	ordered on the wednesday , delivered the following wednesday , how good was that !
neutral	overall , nordica provides a good service in terms of delivery but i think they need to work on their communication .
negative	i waited in all day today for an engineer to visit as stated by the " written off team " and no one visited .
negative	the customer service mamager could not even be bothered to come and speak with me even_though i asked twice and wanted to show it on me .
positive	i would really recommend alpha as it was easy to understand and i quickly found the policy that was right for me , i was able to relax during my holiday and i would definitely use alpha for my next trip
neutral	i ordered some great flint grey skinny cords which i could not find anywhere in size 00 except for you .
negative	merci asos pour tant d ’ efficacité .
negative	none of these items were in stock !!!
neutral	lovely set of professional stainless_steel pots and pans spoiled only by one thing - the incredibly difficult to get off sticky stickers pro - cook mercilessly adhere to the bottom of every pan !!
neutral	overall service is okay .
positive	all in all a great purchase experience .
negative	when ordering the flowers at no point does it state they are delivered by yodel !!!!
neutral	.
positive	will use again , nice quick reliable service
negative	when i got there , the service was appaling .
negative	i have emailed you to report two different packages and i do seem to have the answer i require .
positive	if i have a problem .
neutral	supposed to have been delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 am and i had to phone number on text massage at 0 : 00 to find out where delivery was .
positive	i '_ve bought their ts000 - p wireless lapel and headband microphone kit .
negative	they said their system can '_t process refunds ( which is clearly a lie ).
positive	you get immediate_confirmation of the transfer - you must use them - its really worth it - their exchange_rates are far better_than the banks offer .
positive	i paid £_00 . 00 including delivery for these from goggles0u and they are just as good as the optician '_s pair but at a fraction of the price .
positive	they were £ 0 . 00 cheaper with free delivery .
neutral	comfy sloggies
negative	she tried to look at a macbook_air .
neutral	i can only_assume that these items were lost at ziffit '_s end .
positive	i find dealing_with my bank i need to take time from my work to meet someone in the bank and they will take a few_days to give you an answer .
neutral	however it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch !
positive	ive purchased from kikatek on quite a few occasions already , but the other day was the first time ive actually had to contact them after a possible bodged firmware_update for the apn i ordered .
positive	if they don_'_t have what i am looking for , they go the extra_mile to find out if they can get it for me !
negative	my three emails to viovet did not meet a response .
positive	i just wasn_'_t in a rush so free_postage would have been fine .
neutral	the software was easier to use than with other website companies but the product hasn_'_t arrived yet so i can '_t comment further on quality etc
positive	then the delivery crew rang on the day further to confirm a 0 - hour_slot .
neutral	i deliberated for ages about whether to send it back but in the end decided that it wasn_'_t worth the hassle because i wanted to put it up quickly before my house warming party .
positive	i am very impressed with the delivery service and the speed at which i receive my orders .
neutral	i always have my package within 0_days
negative	as mentioned until order arrives here unable to comment .
positive	we have tried various treatments on our cat , including very well_known_brands from the supermarket and even treatments recommended by our local_vets .
positive	i would recommend to others
negative	exact time is unknown as the card is incomplete .
neutral	however , i was unaware that the quote did not include_vat so a £_00 bill turned into an £_00 bill .
negative	delay was explained as the item being out of stock ( no info was offered during telephone_enquiry / online checkout ).
negative	whilst this is not ideal , i understand that these things_happen occasionally .
neutral	delivered quickly but no invoice so have to chase up which takes time .
positive	we havn '_t actually flown yet , but booking and customer_services got the job_done without hassle .
positive	i have a bit of an odd printer , a canon ip000 portable , for which inks are not the easiest to find .
neutral	the order was processed quickly and delivery arrived the next_day .
negative	i advised that this was unacceptable and requested a full_refund and was given a response of " sorry , what else can i say ".
neutral	a little dissapointed that the silver corrugated pillow boxes , where not of the same quality as the sample gold one or the colour_swatch which i had ordered from .
negative	why should i order through this website and pay the charge if i then have to call direct anyway .
negative	le service clientèle n ' est apparemment qu_' un intermédiaire sans aucun pouvoir concernant le suivi des commandes et / ou des réclamations !
positive	many_thanks ,
positive	i will and have recomended to others and will_definately be my 0st port of call the next time i require tyres .
negative	after the first night there was deep sinkage in the bed where i had slept .
neutral	paid £_00 to keep a hard_copy of all our digital_photos over the years but some look shakey like the machine wasn_'_t calibrated correctly or something ?
neutral	also they are very easy to install .
neutral	the service was good but the quality of flowers poor .
positive	i needed a new_cooker and started the online search for the best deals , the cheapest price and the fastest delivery time etc .
negative	no matter_how much i tried i could to load a picture into the january slot .
positive	this was an easy to use site even when i made an_error on payment would recommend
positive	i have used webuybooks a few_times now and they have always been great and cheque comes through really quickly - very happy with them .
positive	a fantastic service , i have always been extremely happy with lending stream .
positive	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use again and can recommend to anyone
negative	sadly i can only give them a 0_star_rating because 0_weeks_later , i am still_waiting for a response from them .
neutral	products were a very good price , but the postage outweighs the savings .
positive	i have no hestation in recommending this company or it '_s products , expecially this perfume .
positive	haven_'_t yet put it up but am intending to do that this weekend and should look great outside the house .
neutral	i spoke to jay at homebase who said he had arranged for collection today friday , he said no time was booked it would be sometime during the day . i booked a days leave to make_sure it was picked_up ok , well its 0pm and its still not been collected and i '_m unable to get through to homebase , i am not impressed i '_ve wasted a days leave waiting round the house for nothing . leave days are precious when you work full time . so when will it be collected ?
negative	i tried purchasing from this company and my payment did not process .
neutral	i insisted on speaking to the supervisor to make a complaint about his conduct on the call - and that it was not his place to refuse such a request .
neutral	nothing i then spoke to an online rep who said the would be delivered in the next week .
neutral	i '_ve sought an exchange in hope that the one i received is an_isolated example .
negative	i will never book with you again .
negative	he offered to send me a free pair of fitflops if i would delete my review .
neutral	we ended_up having to go to the travel_lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes_walk extra but the stress would '_ve been easily avoided if communication would '_ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
negative	fingers_crossed they give me my refund very soon .
neutral	brought the coat and is really warm however the writing on the front has nearly all but rubbed off which is disappointing especially as only been wearing since christmas
negative	they then wanted me to take another day off work to wait in for their courier to collect it !
neutral	cons - unfortunately , the reason i know that customer service is excellent is because quality control is not up to standard .
positive	very classy products for a reasonable sale price !
negative	terrible experience and service & still no bike or refund !
negative	how pathetic is that ?
negative	one week before i moved i asked scottish_power to assure me that i wouldn_'_t be paying more than i should or be paying off someone_elses debt , what tariff i would be on and how to get these meters removed .
positive	navigating the site is fairly easy , once you get used to what '_s in each ' department ' and the checkout_process is secure and easy to use too .
negative	then out of the blue we received a final demand ( red bar and everything ) telling us that we owe them over £_000 and if we don_'_t pay then it could go to court .
neutral	to the cost of the room , although city tax and occupancy tax were stated as excluded , a tax recovery and and fees charge was added .
negative	at full cost .
neutral	people we spoke to sitting in our row and around us paid £_00 .
neutral	apart_from that i have always loved the oka range .
neutral	however on contacting customer service they were very helpful and a full_refund and collection by courier for return of product was arranged .
positive	arrived the next_day even with the bad_weather_conditions , amazing !
neutral	( there are in fact no_problems with my credit_card , except that i '_ve just moved to a newly_built home whose postcode , though registered by the post_office , does not yet appear on the databases of some private companies , such as pharmacy0u ).
neutral	also not much of anything_else to bulk out and compliment the flowers i chose .
negative	bad_experience will never use them again !
negative	service and delivery were good ( i had about 00 separate texts / emails_confirming and reconfirming ) and the flowers arrived on time , but what a disappointment .
positive	easy to use web_site made ordering easy .
negative	i will never see a deal like that again and they couldn_'_t care less despite me being there first and helping them fix their website , which in turn helped someone_else get these over me .
negative	you took the job on knowing they were to be delivered to a member of staff at a hospital .
negative	it '_s not the money it '_s the principle !!
negative	worst experience ever !!!!
neutral	hi i thought the website was ok to use and had some vouchers to use which i purchased through_groupon for some discounts on hotels .
negative	!
positive	very pleased with the service .
negative	did i expect ethical behaviour ?
positive	how better to fly .
positive	the ordering system meant i always knew where the order was up to and the next_day delivery was just what i needed .
negative	in short , a very stressful experience i will not be in a hurry to repeat .
positive	easy system .
neutral	good service but did not respond to follow - up email query re .
positive	the company was easy to deal with and my furniture was fantastic , delivery much sooner_than the estimated 00 working_days , only worry at first for me was when i called the phone was answered with just a " hello ", so it made me worry that they were not a genuine company but i worried unnecessarily as all was fine .
positive	the product is excellent , very happy with our purchase .
negative	customer service is totally usless if things go_wrong - the worst i '_ve ever_encountered - they just don_'_t give a monkeys .
negative	the elinchrolm system seemed affordable and easy to use and anthony seemed to know his topic .
positive	say no more !
neutral	t allison
neutral	a couple of times however , the food didn_'_t turn_up , and we were told on the phone " just wait , give it a bit longer " etc .
positive	i always purchase stuff through cash_back sites on the internet and when i checked the cash_back site i use i saw that the sum of £_00 . 00 had been added for the ebooker transaction .
negative	my sister sent me a picture of the flowers as they looked so poor .
positive	anyway i needn_'_t have worried .
positive	great items very pleased and fast delivery very helpful
positive	i have given full_marks for the service i received .
negative	sagepay never reply to emails .
negative	why they use the normal mail where i can collect from my post_office which is 000_yards_away .
neutral	it took 0_days to make a purchase once i found what i wanted to buy .
positive	couldn_'_t have been more helpful at the local shop , even_though we ordered on line
neutral	good service and platform .
positive	delivery was straightforward and the overall experience fantastic !
neutral	the only setback is that you have set times for returning to london and this seriously limits your time at the tour .
negative	due to being out of the country i moved it to be delivered on the 00th_june .
positive	je vous recommande ' delamaison '!
negative	i have since emailed their online publicised press office but don_'_t expect to hear back .
negative	if they don_'_t , someone is going to get upset .
neutral	but i couldn_'_t find sample_tiles onlines so i had to return to the shop to order it in store .
positive	great service fast delivery good price
neutral	i am always so impressed by chemistdirect '_s prices and their range of products .
negative	firstly the " returns service " via named shops - none of the shops the parcel was taken to knew anything about the returns services !
positive	placed order arrived next_day .
positive	so three good reasons for choosing simply_supplements
neutral	watch this space !
neutral	i rang ao but there answer was " it '_s delivered by 0rd_party ".
negative	total_waste of time and money !
neutral	putting this all aside , glasses_direct keep you informed on everything , and the glasses come in a week .
negative	this was to be a birthday_present for my 0 year_old daughter .
neutral	my stationary from them was good value for money .
negative	you can_imagine how happy i was with that after holding for 00_minutes .
neutral	expected a bigger_bunch for the price and frankly could have bought two bigger bunches for the same price .
neutral	should be ok as they are munro .
negative	i booked a flight from christchurch ( new_zealand ) to seoul ( south_korea ), with a stop over in sydney ( australia ), for 00th_december_0000 .
neutral	thankfully managed to call him back but he wasn_'_t happy about it - very miserable man !
negative	i fail to understand how a parcel can be delivered to an address that is not even on the parcel or in the same county or why it is so hard for that said parcel to be collected and delivered to the correct_address .
negative	when arriving at the hotel i was told that i had to pay £_000 to make up the full bill so £_000_+ £_000 = £_000 an extra £_00 more then when i actually booked the hotel on the website !
negative	parcel collected from settle north_yorkshire . no_problems . excellent courier .
negative	so when i needed to return the items i bought bathroom and showers_direct applied the letter of the law - and charged a completely pointless 00_% ' restocking ' charge .
neutral	delivery to my address in mainland_scotland is supposed to be approx .
neutral	that would be two_days ago ( no , not 0 days since i checked ; twoi days since anything happened ) .
negative	received an e_- mail saying they had cancelled it / refunded it and saying i should have gone for the other product which was better and same price !
positive	the album looks fantastic , it looks and feels similar to the price , quality paper .
negative	i finally got through to the same woman and asked her why they had changed the description as soon as i got off the phone .
negative	booked a courier to deliver an expensive coffee_machine and although the coffee_machine was boxed and packaged well with bubble_wrap and hard foam , the coffee_machine was in a very bad way internally when i opened the box .
positive	very friendly great service . will order again .
positive	the juicer was delivered on time and in perfect_condition .
neutral	received item from that supplier within 0 day .
negative	this is not about a call_centre being in india , there are many companies with great call_centres abroad in india and other_countries . this is about a call_centre with staff who don_'_t care , maybe don_'_t have the right training , maybe are not set any targets or are not monitored or just don_'_t get feedback about their poor performance .
positive	i was kept up - to - date by email on the despatch of my item which i felt was excellent
positive	its a great torch .
neutral	after we complained we got " an upgrade " which meant , same car other color .
neutral	i am pleased to see that yodel are making serious efforts to improve their level of service .
positive	such a good price
neutral	was told i would be getting phone_call reguarding time of arrival no phone_call according to web_site my fridefreezer would be unwrapped when asked drivers was informed we are only couries so i a pensioner was left to do it myself so don_'_t hold your breath if you want anything unwrapped
negative	they don_'_t .
positive	thank_you
neutral	i informed her that i was disappointed with the service but " i cant do anything was the reply ".
negative	we collected from store - but only a shirt was received .

neutral	as it was a christmas gift .
neutral	all was well after the dispatch so i would just make_sure next time if the item is really in stock before i place an order .

negative	i got told on the phone to send a link of the website where i found the cheaper hotel , which i did .
positive	all in all a fantastic timepiece souced delivered & now_proudly wearing within 00_hrs .

positive	our driver / guide was brilliant & was full of interesting_facts & knowledge about miami .
neutral	i received the sample invitations as ordered and was happy with the quality , however wheni tried to order them on - line , a fault when putting the items in my shopping_basket made my internet browser close .

neutral	hi was pleased with the quick service but when we got our car back it was really dirty .
neutral	also the transfer service for gold car at fiumicino is a nightmare , 0_seater minibuses and a scrum to get on one competing with parkinggo car_park clients . not good when there are 0 of you and two are elderly ( age reduces scrumming ability ).

neutral	no explanation or apology or even if i was going to be sent a replacement pair !
neutral	also the 0 pairs of leggings i purchased were under a £_00 off offer if you spent over_£_00 , so i '_m assuming i will get charged full price for the leggings i recwived which is wrong !
neutral	my 00 : 00 appointment was cancelled at 00 : 00 the day before as they couldn_'_t get the tyres in time .
positive	real good quailty for the money i spent ,, easy ordering and swift delivery . very pleased .

negative	wait_til someone_else is having a sale .
neutral	good service but unfortunately delivered to another address without putting a card in for me to tell me where it was

neutral	many_thanks .
negative	i have been waiting for an entire week for them to refund my money , which they had no_problems debiting from my credit_card account straight_away .
negative	advice
neutral	the full day tour was far too long but that was our choice .
negative	on numerous occassins i used the stupid chatroom that they are keen on you using , i chatted with 0 ' people ' and still didn_'_t get an answer , the last of which told me that my parcel hadn_'_t been delivered and is now scheduled for tomorrow , that '_s great i said but why did another of your operatives tell me 0 hrs earlier that the parcel had been delivered to a neighbour and a card left which is untrue as well because the recipient was in all day and his neighbours haven_'_t received anything , his reply was " i will send an email to the courier to clarify this " and when will i be told of the outcome ?
neutral	overall price paid was still reasonable .
positive	my order was delivered promptly .

neutral	laminate had been stood on end and bounced_around damaging all the cortheners .
neutral	the product was good value , as the insulation is not happening for a few month , the 00_min check was unstuible to asses the items fully to be completely_satisfied , as there is know way you can take items out of packaging and replace fully back to protect the goods .
negative	how come when all staff doing same thing and management being told by employees of this .
neutral	contacted link delight and they spent a week making ridiculous suggestions before confirming that they believed it to be faulty .
negative	i emailed tnt today and they very quickly apologised and stated there had been a delay in hong_kong but apparently it '_s on - route to the uk .

negative	the software is basic with little manipulation available and i still_haven_'_t received my order even_though it was ordered weeks_ago .
neutral	especially with the new ' timeline ' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can '_t see in person a lot .
neutral	solid enough build , trim around storage finished a little sloppily in one corner , dirt mark in one place , packaging filthy - had to clean carpet where it had been .

positive	love this site the prices are great and very very reasonable and reliable !
neutral	i was charged an " airport fee " in addition to the initial fee paid online plus an " out of hours fee " despite it being a saturday_afternoon at a ski destination .

positive	regards
positive	the red stools arrived a day later .
negative	i have so little faith in stratstones that i would rather pay to get this fixed myself than bother trying to claim on the 0 month_warranty given as i was told this was very basic and didn_'_t cover much and the limit on it was £_000 being as the repair will be more than double this i ' d rather go_elsewhere with my custom .
neutral	on the day delivery was due , we tried to track it via computer but got the answer that the number was unknown .
positive	fast delivery and cheaper products perfect result .
positive	i would definitely recommend fone_bank .
negative	00th_december_0000 - 0 january , express service , what a joke !
neutral	thus wish to buy more from the store , but after my last purchase , sizes in ' large ', ( my size ) are now coming up as a ' small ' and two items i have bought have been in ' xxlarge ' in order for me to fit into them .
neutral	i hope all will be corrected within the year as i have credit notes , due to mentioned items returned above , are not able to be refunded due to their returns_policy .
positive	i ordered a desk which av0home kindly price matched .

neutral	in fact , i got a phone_call at 0pm from their customer service saying that they didn_'_t have any drivers to deliver that same day .

positive	received the camcorder , in original sony packaging later that day .
negative	i returned the jacket to the shop and got a refund so i could purchase a size large from the website and when i received the size large ( size 00 ) it was no better !
neutral	ok this was the busy_period of the year so i '_m_sure it isn_'_t like that normally .
neutral	the delivery man was actually seen leaving after just putting a card through the door without_knocking - i mean , why_bother walking to the door without_knocking !
negative	however i will most definitely not be paying any money to use the jessops_photo service .
neutral	this was quite worrying and concerning , because i did send off my phone as soon as the package arrived - and in the end , it was acknowledged , and i got the original offer price .
negative	dear_sir or madam ,
positive	the small catalogue is an ideal source of reference and ideas for the motor enthusiast .
negative	order due for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 text_message and e_- mail to confirm , never arrived so phoned jjb on 00 / 0 / 00 was told they would check getting delivered 00 / 0 / 00 .

neutral	i ordered home mobile_broadband with the 00day rolling_contract but the process was far from smooth .
neutral	the balloon was apparently nice but didn_'_t stay inflated very long and i paid for next_day delivery but it took 0_days which was very disappointing as i missed my daughters_birthday date ,
neutral	!
positive	bit bored of flyers , mugs and pens so googled this product .
neutral	also had a phone_call from the area manager danny rose who_apologised for the bad_experience and said he would be investigating why this happened .
negative	regards margaret reene
neutral	i hope my next experience is not quite so tortuous and prolonged .
positive	normally i dont use these services , i '_m a typical ' i '_ll ebay it ' and then never get round to it .
neutral	no one checked the existing damage with us .
neutral	i sent an_email straight_away to cancel and amend the dates but wqs tol this was not acceptable .

positive	it was a sightly long wait for the cash but in the end it all came in and i will_definitely be using topcashback again .
neutral	somewhat_disappointed
neutral	you have lost most of the slot games from the previous site which offered a lot more variety than what you have now .
positive	i was more than satisfied and so is my boyfriend .
neutral	would not return if this is indicative .
neutral	they were silver and blue as the school colours .
neutral	the tablet cover was delivered in the wrong_colour despite the enclosed invoice being correct .
negative	and then we will be taking our £_000_+ aweek shop to sainsbury .
neutral	however the delivery was less_than reasonable .
neutral	in all_respects , pretty_much on a par with quidco in respect of rates and ease of use .
neutral	we got your money now sod_off !!
positive	their platinum saver system is incredible !
neutral	next comes the fitting of the sink .
positive	!
neutral	i ordered two bright side plant markers .
negative	all i can say is , what a shocking customer experience .
positive	very quick turn_around
neutral	it did not work , and i dried it out for days and days so considered getting some money for it .
neutral	it was frustrating that not once in that period did i recieve any contact from them to say there was a problem .
neutral	screws / bolts were of good quality , but very disappointed that anchoring fixings were not included having been assured by waltons that everything i needed was in the pack .
negative	buy your products from people who care about your custom .

neutral	we had intended to order my fiance '_s ring that day too but after this experience we actually went to another jewellers who managed to make his ring on time and perfectly .
negative	so i have given up disinterested customer service employees and incompetent back of house employees .
negative	after_spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	just wont to say thankyou thankyou with your help i was able to get the perfect present for my boyfriend . not only was it easy but fast , relieable and very very helpfull i will keep your address on my contact list for future gifts .
positive	secure because they send sms ( 00 pence price ) to phone of activities
negative	yodel : im_afraid this has_been delivered david .
negative	firstly to get the car sold and of the forcourt .
positive	as they are fragile , they arrived expertly_packaged in what i thought was polystyrene but was actually a biodegradable wheat product !
negative	they really have lost complete touch with the customer experience .
neutral	if the flowers had been left out all night they would have probably died .
neutral	would love more pictures on each brush .
neutral	i was able to pick my delivery day .
negative	good idea , too hard to use - links didn_'_t work .
negative	they should never have taken my money or promised to supply it .
negative	firstly let_me say the transaction was superb , my new dji000 naza lite quadcopter arrived quickly and they changed an incorrect item without_question .
negative	i ordered some flowers for our granny '_s 00nd_birthday .
positive	great service and fantastic price .
negative	so well_done tesco for shooting yourselfs in the foot .
positive	super quick delivery , constantly informed of delivery status . ordered the whey_protein_isolate 00 .
neutral	but i thought you should know that there ought to be a double layer of packing at the bottom of the box to prevent this sort of thing happening .
neutral	just let_me print my ticket
positive	thanks
neutral	i '_ve contacted probikekit to query delivery and they haven_'_t got back to me today ( yet ).
negative	not good enough .
positive	this is the first time i have shopped at gardentoolbox but i can_honestly_say i will be going back , goods were dispatched quickly , 0 item was out of stock but i have been kept well informed and it will be delivered in a few_days .
negative	i emailed but got no reply , i called twice and the first time i was told the courier would email me , the second one said that it had been despatched but couldn_'_t give me the details .
negative	booked a party here in the dragonfly suite .
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00
positive	el ahorro de dinero es_muy interesante y_la_calidad es la misma que comprandolo en tienda .
neutral	the approach of the person dealing_with me was inappropriate .
neutral	i had no choice but to ' verify with facebook ' or abandon teh review .
neutral	although the packaging was not damaged the surface of the corotile was damaged on the top sheet and the odd edge on the remainder .
neutral	the eye_mask didn_'_t cover the eyes properly and the paint peeled_off of the belt within an_hour .
negative	after all they wouldn_'_t have ' vouchers ' for scam companies would they ?
neutral	the cabinet i ordered was to store a large_quantity of music c . ds .
neutral	postage seemed expensive too .
positive	a great buy .
neutral	it was easy to organise the parking and the parking was conveniently_located to the airport_terminal however when i returned , after a long day , i had to request assistance to be let out because ( i presume ) the exit_barrier didn_'_t recognise my number_plate .
negative	i '_ve_used this meet and greet 0 times , first occasion was ok , second time my car was returned covered in mud with muddy_footprints on the inside of the back door and footwell .
neutral	blurry and pixilated , still ok but i expected better quality :(
positive	their staff are always friendly and helpful over the phone and even emailed me a free returns_label to assist when returning a product to to an incorrect sizing .
positive	i cant recommended this company enough !
neutral	after 00 days i had nothing but an intial acknowledgement of the sale .
positive	great site and extemely quick shipping .
neutral	for the price i would have expected it to arrive in a cardboard_tube at_least .
negative	my experience is you get what you pay for but with this one you pay over the top for less .
positive	will_definitely use this supplier again .
negative	phone number is 00000_000000 .
positive	particularly_like the fact that they provide a uk contact number , address and an option to speak to them , rather_than ordering from an_unknown source or supplier .
negative	won_'_t use their website again .
positive	i was very pleased with the delivery time they arrived 0 days after the payment was made .
neutral	telephoned and was told paying line rental upfront was not an option on the internet but this could be done over the telephone .
neutral	i emailed to ask if my order had been dispatched , and when i might expect to receive it .
neutral	the only_downside is customer sevice takes_ages to answer calls & the online billing system is awkward to access - sending you a time limited pin to access your account - secure but long_winded .
negative	am going to ask trading_standards for advice .
positive	tiles arrived as planned 00_hrs_later - lovely friendly delivery man , amazed to be told , when regaling him with how i came to order them , that if i hadn_'_t liked them when they were delivered he '_d have happily taken them away and got my money refunded .
negative	very unhappy and will not order again .
positive	they were valued instantly online , my return envelope arrived in the post the very next_day and my cheque arrived a couple of days_later !

positive	once i placed the order i received three text to confirm that the order had been received , had left the building and once delivered .
neutral	unable to compare as forced to make decision quickly otherewise cannot return .
neutral	sure_enough , my camera was showing as " shipped " on working day 0 , and was delivered via city_link on working day 0 .
neutral	great price ( especially when compared with our vet '_s price ), excellent delivery ( next_day ), very polite and helpful customer service but too many tins were severely dented .
neutral	we decided to go with the beetle which thankfully turned_out to be a nice car .
neutral	so , i sent it back ( note ; using £ 0 p_&_p recorded - stupid post_office worker ) and resubmitted my order in the correct_size .
neutral	i purchased a set of thank_you cards which included 0 photos .
positive	very quick service , arrive the next_day .
positive	the only_thing it lacks in my opinion is creating an account so you can log in .
neutral	i have to say this drivers behaviour appeared to be an exception , all the other bigbustours staff we came_across were helpful and courteous and we really enjoyed the majority of the tour .
negative	after cheap frozen , canned , jarred and cold food .
positive	would definitely recommend , bought a bugaboo parasol which was out of stock pretty_much everywhere_else so didnt think i would be able to get it , but it came the next_day , with no_problems was very impressed !
neutral	the website is well_laid_out , the hard_sell technique in terms of additional items , ( vase , balloons etc ) are the only area that makes your site feel cheap and gimmicky .
negative	some useless customer service lady tells_me the package was not scanned .
negative	i ordered with a lot of expectation since this was a surprise for my 00th_anniversary .
positive	great easy to use website , no_problems putting your orders in .
positive	already_recommended to friends .
negative	their prices may be cheap but their logistical organisation and response is woeful .
positive	cheap , tasty powder .
neutral	is that my fault ?
negative	!
neutral	i now do not feel like i can trust the guys in the bournemouth store , as i almost purchased from another store , or ebay .
positive	we have never been let_down by challenge_trophies .
positive	thanks
positive	most of the time the contents were presents for her children so this was always upsetting .
neutral	( literally !)
negative	ordered a sink they delivered an_alternative without telling_me .
neutral	i would have thought there would be at_least a cheaper , if not free rate for shipping when spending a large_amount .
negative	endid u sending me a pay and go sim .
neutral	i also would say that as i drink a lot of decaff , nespresso it is hard to please a decaff drinker every time .
positive	found this web_site had just what we were looking for very quick delivery and the product was just what we wanted
neutral	they seem to say if there is a problem it '_s not their fault and it '_s up to the customer to sort it out or rebook again at extra_cost .
positive	thomas
negative	they even make the total of your goods show up in red so that '_s all you see .
negative	but unfortunately i was ill , and unable to travel , so didn_'_t stay at the hotel .
positive	the sign for our new build " dove house " looks great
negative	i could cut costs and run this company better if i was company director
negative	unacceptable
positive	the product was in stock and depstached very quickly .
negative	i purchased a paid of goal keeper gloves .
positive	they are excellent .
positive	been using as for 0 years_now wouldnt go_anywhere_else and i dont have to check prices elsewhere as their price match guarantees me the cheapest price and fast free delivery .
neutral	i ordered some sandals , great product , well_packed .
negative	the guy on the phone told me i didn_'_t understand how stock worked , but if he knew what i did for a living , he ' d be embarressed .
negative	today , i was angrily told that because i collected a parcel only , i was no good to him .
positive	after a few brisk walks , you realise that these fit - flops are exercising your calves mightily !
neutral	no ability to see order pdf once sent , and delivery slow ( still not arrived ).
neutral	there seems to be no link to get back to it once you have added an item .
neutral	i use the website almost every week since i '_m traveling for about 0 years .
negative	completely gutted !
positive	kept in touch during the whole order process .
positive	cult_pens noticed i had requested the same order twice , put second order on hold and contacted me immediately to check i only wanted the order once .
negative	needless to say i will not be back .
negative	thus i don_'_t have another £_000 to pay for another grocery delivery until the money is refunded .
positive	they are always cheaper_than other online_retailers and delivery times are exceptional , often next_day .
neutral	please reconsider and go back to dpd - you will lose custom if you don_'_t i '_m_sure !
negative	i phoned the number on the website and it cut me off after saying they had a high_volume of calls ( unsurprising ).
positive	in the beggining we asked for a wine tour with an accent on architecture , as we wanted to see as many chateaux as possible in 0_days .
positive	oh_yes and the helmet was cheaper here than anywhere_else by a big margin .
positive	the website is very easy to use and good descriptions .
positive	they just finished the yard up just nice .
neutral	to summarise them in a few words .
positive	they were great at giving advice on what hen_party would be suited to us and answered any_questions that were asked extensively .
neutral	however , a subscription is no_longer of interest to me personally , so i wrote to cancel in the beginning of january , only to be still charged in february !
negative	rubbish quality - cheap is not the word .
positive	i will certainly use eflorist again
neutral	i think you should only have to pay the amount of fuel used we returned the car with more than a quarter of a tank also charged vat on the fuel and hire of a child '_s car_seat i thought vat was already on fuel when you pay at the pumps 000_euros on top rental of car a bit_steep for a week
negative	we originally went for what we thought were upmarket blinds to compliment the new bathroom we had installed .
neutral	not impressed with lg .
neutral	while i like the service , price etc .
negative	look through the statistics it is basically self_explanatory .
positive	the service is always good & quick , always got what you want at a good price
positive	this is the second time i have dealt_with mazuma and i am just as satisfied .
positive	arrived next_day , put batteries in and that '_s it .
negative	however and this is the bit people should be careful of . i made my third order a few_days ago and looked forward to the swift delivery , when it arrived , i discovered a very badly packed , well should i say not packaged at all , bottle of bubble bath had leaked over a large_quantity of of my items .
positive	first_class company to deal with .
neutral	however the guy delivering said that they didn_'_t really have many purple or blue flowers , therefore leaving the bouquet looking a bit empty , and the flowers that were there are quite tatty and old looking .
positive	we searched online for oak tops and we were impressed with the worktop_express website and comments left by past customers .
negative	i also had to patch up the packaging , as bits would literally fall through the hole at the impact zone .

neutral	when i ordered these for my daughter the bouquet looked luxurious and full .
positive	from explaining what our requrements were and recieving advice and recommendations from the ramp_people , to placing the order , delivery within 00_hours was most impressive .
neutral	i could track the order online although the stated time_slot for delivery was very wide ( 00 : 00 gmt - 00 : 00 ).
neutral	a little while later i got a text from dpd to tell me that delivery would be wednesday with an option to text back to change it .

neutral	de_volgende ochtend direct in ' mijn boekingen ' gekeken , weer was mijn aanbetaling niet zichtbaar , dit gaf mij weer een onrustig gevoel .
negative	!
negative	at this point i was told that i could have a store credit but not a refund to my card .
negative	the food was also spilled all over the bag , yet he told me that he doesn_'_t care .
negative	on 0rd_october_0000 i made the unfortunate decision to purchase a pool / hockey / table_tennis_table from uk sports_imports as a birthday_gift for my fiancé .
negative	i ordered 0 games on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	auto_europe used to be the only place i would look for a hire car , i would definitely try to get a car elsewhere next time .
positive	bought the corner_sofa and separate footstool .
negative	several unhelpful phone_calls later , visits to shops & live_chats has resulted_in me finding out that vodafone take 00_hours to update your data , no two service representatives give you the same answer , 00 hour call back on escalations means 0 working_days & not 0 days like you would expect , 0 attempts to call back does not exist , two of my escalations have resulted_in callbacks of 0 attempts in about 0 min & 0 attempt which the network dropped me !!!
neutral	in the end i left my husband to wait alone while i checked our_luggage in .
neutral	i immediately saw an area he had not masticked which i asked him to correct , the units were left very dusty , lee spent a long time cleaning all the units at the end of his day despite knowing they were not complete .
neutral	so we all arrived at our first activity which was dirty_dancing , unfortunately the company had told me a different time to what they actually booked .
negative	even their website has no security certificate , so who_knows when your details end up .
neutral	so left with a bad_taste .
negative	if somethings not in stock or there is a problem you should send a email or get in contact with the customer .
positive	!
neutral	however , the box was basically battered with a gaping gap in the top of it .
negative	here ’_s a suggestion wowcher employ more than one person then !
neutral	i wish they would send an instruction_leaflet with the products , that has important ' need to knows ' such as when it '_s safe to re enter the room after treatment etc .
positive	great product , excellent service
neutral	there should be trusted community members or paid tutors to go over corrections to make_sure the student of the language is not being mislead by a correction .
neutral	there '_s no way i would have paid the full price however if i did , the order processing and delivery time would have been the same which weren_'_t brilliant .
positive	happy with the service .
positive	very pleased with our results brings back memories of our holidat .

positive	excellent service and good to deal with over the phone .
neutral	updated - they have now replied and refunded the difference so i '_ve changed my star_rating .
negative	again cold bowl and food only just tepid the ingredients were not fresh , tuna tinned as you could taste and smell brine as you bit into it , clams i suggest were from a jar as tasted of vinegar , prawns frozen rather_than fresh , garlic and tomato_sauce watery and linguini was swimming in it .
neutral	unfortunately they were a little tight and i had to return them , also very easy .
negative	not ideal , but said ok . got a call yesterday to say item had not arrived in warehouse , so delivery early july !

negative	delivered a faulty washing_machine on monday 00th_dec ( hotpoint_washing_machine wmef000puk ) which had a 0cm split in the waste_pipe , which subsequently flooded the kitchen .
positive	i '_m delighted and would have no desitation in recommending them .
neutral	although the costume was delivered on time i felt the picture was better_than the goods and the material looked heavier_than the goods i received .
negative	i '_ll be avoiding like the plague in future and believe that they are representing the ford name in a very poor manner .
negative	the moment has_gone as the birthday was the 0th not today or tomorrow , no response yet again from my e_-_mails to their own email in - box , just ignored .
positive	nice massage .
neutral	after 0 days i phoned to see where it was : " it will be going out today ".
positive	0 .
negative	i ordered the princess sofia dress for my daughter for christmas , i ordered this item over 00 days ago and had an_email the next_day to confirm my order and a dispatch_notice to say the item had gone out for dispatch .
neutral	a good online shop with a huge_range , let_down by a less_than perfect ( but better_than awful ) customer service .
positive	i have ordered here many a time , and every time i get great service , prompt service .
positive	i called quite a few leasing companies but rivervale stood_out from the rest with their helpful staff .
neutral	would i deal with them again ?

negative	trading_standards will be getting a letter from me about the company .
negative	absolutely_disgraceful .
positive	brilliant
negative	this is when i finally decided they did not know what they were talking_about ( startup items get loaded at startup and configuring the pc to not load them and not rebooting is pointless because they have already loaded up ).
neutral	so far , have always found petmeds reliable and easy to deal with .
neutral	cafe is handy , some branches better_than others .
neutral	chemist_direct need to review their ordering_process on line to ensure this does not happen again .
negative	it '_s not stated when you pay and as woolovers knew full well that next_day delivery wasn_'_t possible ( but their customers don_'_t !
negative	they also state that their very low valuation is for the car in perfect_condition and any variation from this will reduce the valuation .
negative	i had been told i would get £_00 for my 0gs .
neutral	having said this my advisor went to great lengths to source me the same car from a dealer and honored the original deal which i found very satisfying .
neutral	i persuaded him to help me unpack it and manoeuvre it into place , although , as he told me , it was not his job .
positive	matt pike .
negative	i was a business stream customer after a couple of months fighting to get the correct bill i decided just to change supplier .
neutral	a couple of phone_calls to the ' office ' brought him back to pick us up about ten_minutes later , again to a completely deserted compound with no manned on - site office or facilities .
negative	00_hours before what was going to be a wonderful evening with family and friends , and my garden looks like .
negative	today we are in 00 . 00 . 0000 !!!
positive	probably the best place to buy pens etc .
neutral	had to use my own screws without which i would not have been able to install the blind - simple as that .
negative	have a refund .
negative	they also did not provide the card i chose and instead used one with gift_card on the front when i had chosen a valentines one .
positive	so any one out there who is not sure , at_least give it a try .
neutral	that was totally unaccepted .
positive	the sizes were right and the packaging was minimum .
negative	half an_hour later he did phone back in which during our conversation he said that i had said that it was kwik fits fault that i had a slow_puncture .
positive	i thought the service was so good i wrote this review - my first ever !!
negative	0 .
negative	awful that they are allowed to continue trading and awful that skyscanner continues to include them in searches !
negative	that was at lunchtime .
positive	i would highly_recommend .
negative	complained and basically got told to take it or leave it .
negative	i asked to speak to the guy_who had misinformed me earlier , he wasn_'_t available .
positive	the newer version is a tiny_bit higher_spec but that didnt make a scrap of difference to how easily this worked for the job i needed to do so who needs the latest_version ?
neutral	i have tried to call you on numerous_occasions and it is continually engaged which too i am annoyed with .
neutral	the delivery was prompt and the delivery man very polite , problem was that the fresh items delivered had one or two day shelf_life , many items where looking past the shelf_life .
neutral	the refund was paid instantly , but i am disappointed that they didn_'_t make more of an effort to send missing items or at_least offer them at same price on my next order or free with next order as an_apology .
neutral	!
negative	or loreena mckennitt ?
positive	i '_m well satisfied their service .
neutral	i was looking for a roland_cube 00xl for some time .
positive	great price to start with - excellent communication from aftersale - delivery tracking brilliant - delivery men excellent .
negative	good place to sell unwanted things but the company charges too much on conmission , with paypal .
neutral	not impressed !
negative	it '_s a disgrace that you are enabling ticket_touts in this way
neutral	going through the ordering_process online was quick and easy with cheap prices .
negative	shortly 00_mins .
positive	we ordered a couple of samples and were happy with what we received so we went_ahead with the order .
negative	i '_ve not had my delivery and can '_t get an answer on when it will turn_up
positive	matt turned_up when he said he would , explained what he was going to do , and said he would give me a shout when he was finished .
positive	he said it was fine , but he had to make a phone_call and wait 0 minutes .
neutral	( westfield branch )
negative	0_days_later i managed to speak to someone via the online_chat who told me my order was still being_processed and would be another 0_days !!
positive	an excellent product from an excellent company , and at a great price .
positive	amazing and will_definitely be using them again in the near_future .
positive	with so many providers to choose from i would be happy to recommend age_partnership .
neutral	however the postage for this one item cost £ 0 . 00 which i consider to be an extortionate figure .
negative	other order the same plus they have been delivered to wrong_address
negative	they offered credit which still has not been added to my account .
positive	excellent quality products too .
positive	next_day delivery was the cherry on the cake .
neutral	i recently used them , and didn_'_t have any_problems at all .
negative	they just stopped my internet one day ( the same day i paid for the previous month ).
negative	when i received the vouchers i went on the website and tried to order them .
negative	i will not order from them again !
positive	very competitively_priced - great customer service , called me to verify id and confirm delivery .
positive	i ordered a beautiful christmas jumper , which arrived quickly was great quality and everyone loved it .
neutral	too white and roses not very exciting looking .
positive	my eldest was struggling with making up imaginative stories , he has really improved since buying the story_cubes .
negative	well thats no good to me . so i called them and i got the most unexpected display of customer service that i have ever had in my whole life .
negative	it had still not arrived past the maximum 00 days stated so i emailed them .
neutral	order came 0_days after_placing it , none of the numerous voucher_codes i had worked , including the ones medic_animal sent to me themselves . found a company ( viovet ) who are lots cheaper and deliver first thing the day after_placing order for free .
positive	i received parts with no delay . good service .
positive	the driver brought my parcel asked if he had pressed the flat number 00 no the numbers only went up to 0 .
positive	!😃😃😃😃
negative	which idiot actually leave their phone lying_around so it can be stolen ?
negative	then they closed for christmas and the promise of an upgraded bouquet was ordered for the 00th . again nothing and the same thing for 00th_december .
negative	the premium pricing therefore no_longer translates to a better quality of service , unlike it did at the time when we first joined all those years_ago .
negative	a bit of hope for you all
neutral	remember these_guys are just a third_party between you and the actual rental company .
negative	all '_s well that ends well though , i asked for my ipad back and then i sent it to carphonewarehouse yesterday and they have just replied by email agreeing the top price of an excellent condition ipad of £_000 . 00 ( which probably would have been more if i hadn_'_t have had my time wasted by gadgetpanda !
positive	so quick and easy . will_definately do it again .
negative	the flowers were almost dead !
neutral	you are offering me another tyre , the continental which is comparable in quality and offered at £_000 from £_000 , so i am told , but then told that the bridgestones are very popular - so divided advice
neutral	i ordered invites for my sons_christening .
positive	a very impressive service .
negative	got no calls and no card .
neutral	i was lead to beleive that this was an excellent product from reviews . this was brought as a birthday_present and was put_together for a surprise by persons who have a good knowlege of garden_buildings . some of the structure were not true , no post that joins the handels together and skrews were to short .
neutral	instead of looking around in 0 - 0 outlets for specific foods such as grill food , indian , halal .
neutral	not good experience .
positive	peter cowper
neutral	collected car from linate airport .
neutral	the parcel was delivered to my home , then i asked it to be redelivered to my local post_office .

negative	having said that when things go ok its fine .
positive	got me various quotes , the person i picked answered my emails and phone_calls promptly .
neutral	my advice would be if they do not have any in stock they should state it at the time of purchase to give people a chance to find another_supplier
negative	nothing .
positive	your site has taken the pain from my re orders , no traveling to collect .
neutral	but thankyou great service :)
positive	they send me an_email_informing_me when the order is sent , and i usually have delivery within a few_days .
positive	i regularly recommend beers of europe to friends because of the great range and quick delivery times - and there '_s always something new to try .
neutral	it cost me nearly_£_00 to try on the gillet so it '_s definitely put me off using or recommending this company in the future .
neutral	the whole_process was somewhat laboured but at_least i saved about £_00 .
neutral	so i '_ve got all this por00 paint and all set to spray underside of pick - up ,
neutral	have always received a great service from partyrama .

neutral	the trip to calais was fine due to less people on the ferry !
positive	i would recomend to anyone if asked .
neutral	could be a great company because the staff are really friendly and know what they are talking_about just let_down by the quality of the communications with the client .

neutral	excellent range of lens options .
negative	i ordered more than £_000 of bathroom furniture from this company on wednesday 0th_november_0000 expecting it to be dispatched the following_day .
neutral	on balance i would probably consider_buying from them again .
neutral	wrong_size , but great that you can just take them to a collect point to return .
positive	next_day delivery of the envelope , emails to tell you how your order is progressing and super_fast payment .
positive	i will certainly use again and have recommended to other '_s .

positive	luckily i made the flight wih about 00_mins to spare once i ’ d cleared the queues at check in and security .
negative	i have sent a recorded delivery letter to their wakefield address asking for the goods or my monies reimbursed , but still no response .
negative	i '_m waiting for a resolution at the moment .
positive	the " after sales " service could not be_faulted and provided a fast delivery service , including engraving on the stethoscopes .
negative	just google jet0 damaged luggage and you will see they are pirates .
neutral	they really didn_'_t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
neutral	the item purchased was for my friends stag_do and i '_m really pleased with what i received .

negative	.
negative	i asked her does she get a lot of a grief to which she answered " like you wouldnt believe !!"
negative	shocking service to say the least but judging_by other comments on this site , prestige_flowers won_'_t be the slightest bit bothered that they spoilt my birthday surprise .
negative	i would never use you again
positive	very good service
negative	sadly the item did not arrive on time .
negative	they don_'_t care about customers .
positive	so i went online and compared different products and smokerelief is the best kit you will find for price and quality .
negative	i made the point that i doubted the date i actually had available would be free then but apparently there was nothing she could do about it .
neutral	the message was evident on the package also .
positive	very highly_recommended !
positive	the website was easy to navigate and i was able to view my new sign prior to ordering so i knew_exactly_what i was getting , i was told an exact date to expect my delivery and it arrived bang_on time .
neutral	rimless turned_out to be weak and easily broken .
neutral	at 0 . 00 i called the support number and was told that mechanic would be there " within the hour ".
neutral	very disappointed and would hesitate before ordering anything_else from them as a gift .
neutral	my son eventually managed to get through in the middle of the night after which the order was despatched , with no explanation of the delay .
negative	i wonder will i get a reply to this .
positive	within 00_minutes , we received 00 quotations , with full prices quoted , date / time availability , individual ratings and other useful_tips .
neutral	i think in future they should warn customers that if they use the paypal option , all information will be taken from their account as i am sure there have been other people in a similar_situation to me .
negative	the courier came and i thought that was the end but , after two_weeks no payments have been received .
positive	don_'_t understand_why the branch can '_t offer the free guarantees though if you quote the internet offer .
neutral	website good .
positive	i '_m_sure there are other_websites out there who sell d ' addario pro steels , but i never visit them .

negative	on the primark website you cant really see there range of clothes .
positive	found kitchenappliancecentre by_accident searching for a supplier of a smiths plinth_heater .
neutral	delivery was re - scheduled without the missing items , but due to notes added to the order ( not by the customer ) could not be completed and was re - scheduled .
negative	this site might be ok if you ' re happy to wait up to a month for delivery as the price is good , but the service is lousy .
negative	want to be charged for goods you never received nor signed for to be then declined refunds ?
neutral	they sent out a 0nd_class returns sticker .
negative	then the clubs arrived and they were both the incorrect clubs ordered and poor quality and fakes .
neutral	it was like this all day .
positive	a truly 0st_class service .
positive	when several of the guests commented on how smart my son looked in his outfit , i was happy to tell them where we had bought it and what good servcie we had received .
neutral	this has to be their decision .
neutral	in addition , the bad_press about not paying taxes has made me uncomfortable with them anyway .
neutral	it took several weeks to get the item and despite our satisfaction with the product we cannot use partyrama again because we cannot_afford any more risks with our_wedding decorations .
neutral	i paid £ 0 . 00 for p_&_p (+ vat ) and could only select next_day delivery .
neutral	the only problem stoping me giving it 0_stars is the machine leaks efluid into mouth quiet often
positive	a wonderful choice of healthy_foods and exceptional quality .
negative	as soon as i realised they had taken money without my consent i cancelled my subscription but they still took more money .
positive	i have now tried it and the key works !
positive	bought two of these for my sons bedrooms .
positive	i was unfortunate to be caught up in a motorway closure on the m00 on september 0th .
neutral	a shame because there is some good stuff in here and the style of presentation is engaging ( even if the sections are a little brief in some cases ).
positive	quick delivery and customer service communication
positive	super quick delivery and great customer_services , huge_range of products - wont use any one else :)
neutral	delivery contractor does not seem to care about customer requests or agreed requirements .
negative	if the follow_up feature mentions that customers also cannot trust you to deliver their order it will make customers think_twice about using your company .
positive	we received the item quicker_than_expected and have applied it to our lawn today , in the lovely spring weather .
neutral	so far the ' sellers ' from whom i have purchased have been excellent and i therefore would say the experience will invite me to browse and purchase via_ebay again .
positive	loved the choice of wellimgtons .
negative	i have also sent a letter to amazon asking them not to use this carrier in the future and i would suggest everyone_else with similar_experiences of this company do the same .
positive	i cannot recommend them more highly .
positive	this was the first time i used trading_depot .
negative	so many_times i claimed nothing happend because lebara only wants money , not giving a service back to the customer .
positive	if you want value for money , then argos is the place to be .
neutral	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
positive	the quality of the doors was excellent and they were able to be cut to size and retain their integrity .
negative	i am_disgusted with the service and incompetence of this company which is obviously run by complete and utter imbeciles !
neutral	flowers came promptly but condition of the flowers were not as expected .
positive	speedy free delivery and clear delivery times to suit anyone .
negative	i have attempted four deliveries this week and had a friend stay at my flat during the hour_window in which delivery was promised but they didn_'_t turn_up .
negative	and , if i want to get my money back for blackberry and email service , i will need to request it in writing and it can take up to 0_weeks for a response .!
neutral	also , there seems to be no way to sign off from repeat offender ' vip ' promotional text_messages and emails .
positive	definitely recommended +++++
neutral	i haven_'_t seen the flowers so cannot_comment on the quality however while placing the order i did ask that if the recipient was not in , to place them around the back of the property unaware that access is difficult .
neutral	for this reason i prefer to deliver to either my work address or use collect_+ for smaller items , as otherwise it '_s difficult to know when to book a day off work for delivery .
neutral	i was expecting a better quality of glass and picture , felt the price was a little high for the item we recieved .
negative	at the time of writing ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i still have not received the gift_card .
negative	i thought i would use their price match_promise , quoting another sites product .
positive	is what i found to the best part of the agreeemnt , unlike an airline , is that , and at no extra_cost , was the chance to board an earlier later crossing .

positive	musclefood are cheap and the food is unbelievably good .
neutral	i returned the glasses and it took another 0_weeks to get this fixed .
negative	they then had the cheek to send me an_email_saying if i left a good review for them on the link they provided , they would send me a £ 0 gift voucher , which would be useless to me , because i have absolutely no_intention of buying from this company or their sister company bigimagination . co . uk .
positive	item arrived next_day .
neutral	after_placing an order on sunday i was able to track the delivery via their chosen carriers web_site .
neutral	another time order accepted , no product arrived and on phoning them , they said my card_details were incorrect , even_though they stored them on their system from previous_orders and i have used them again since .
negative	the carnations were turning_brown , the gypsophilia was all snapped and the roses were drooping , to say i am not impressed is an_understatement and i doubt i will be using this service again , nor will i recommend it to my friends .
positive	i was really happy with the item
negative	the girl was gaffing about on the phone and kept telling_me she had to check something .
negative	so my message is , god help you if a purchase goes_wrong !!!

neutral	the buy stage is eventually shown on a green button but it doesn_'_t say " buy " although on seeking help that is the term the helper used showing further inconsistency in the approach because you then look for a button saying " buy " you get lots of warnings saying do not expose contact details but these would be better as pop - ups rather that cluttering up the task .
negative	this company have obviously never_heard of customer_care and they dont deserve to be recognised as a supplement selling business .
positive	i would recommend azimo and use them again .
negative	there were no good .
negative	bought a computer from these and it developed a fault after 0_weeks .
neutral	will be going back to nespresso .

negative	they told me they had photo '_s proving the additional fault - have been to trading_standards and asked them repairs 0 to prove etc and they have since stopped_replying .
neutral	however only 0_stars as quality of item was very poor and inferior .
negative	eventually they agreed to let_me exit my contract after numerous hours of arguing and frustration , and they gave_me a pac_code however they now hold me to ransom for the unlock_code for the iphone .
neutral	i purchased a new set of frames in june and wiuthin a few_weeks the arm screw came out and then as a consequence , so did the lense .
positive	loved the special extra of haribo '_s !

neutral	couldn_'_t be bothered to send them back !
positive	great pair of wellies ( bogs ) at a good price with quick dleivery
negative	i received a refund , though the process took an unreasonable amount of time .
neutral	it was frustrating as i wasn_'_t going to pay p_&_p for one item and then find the others in stock later on .
neutral	to see if it was my computer i did run another book from another company and this problem did not occur .
positive	he checked my other tyres as well .
positive	so i looked for something to give them a bit of a boost and that '_s when i found in the cage and avairy your product ( avigold_plus ) i '_ve been using it for a few_days now and i have already noticed a difference .
negative	monday 00th , 0_weeks into the 0 day fit and french_polisher arrives and spends a lot of time and effort trying to fix things but despite his_efforts we are still left with a door that due to it being squashed somewhen has a very noticeable damaged area and a dented cornice that any professional fitter would not have fitted in the first place so still trying to get a resolution .
positive	flowers were delivered beautifully_presented and very fresh .
neutral	ordered 0 gk shirts in small mens , green .
negative	sky now got seriously involved so a resolution should be , i hope quick .
positive	ease of use and speed of process
neutral	i must_say that customer_services were really helpful and friendly and i would use the company again .
negative	it went straight through even_though there was less money in the account so i do not understand what the problem could have been in the first place .
neutral	vervolgens heb_ik gebeld met de_klantenservice , die gaven mij de boodschap dat_ik dan maar een screenprint van_mijn bankrekening met daarop de afschrijving moest mailen naar de administratie , wederom gaf mij dat een onrustig gevoel .
positive	no_problems
neutral	was told that the hob had been depatched on friday and so should be with me shortly .
neutral	and it is a quality garment superbly made , fits 000_%, is quality material & looks the part .
negative	thought we '_d give them a second chance with another order - same problems again .
positive	a classic way of how a business transacton should run , swift and smoothly .
positive	when i opened the boxes the quality of the workmanship and materials was plain to see .
neutral	silly .
neutral	this was the fact that we had two skrews only for the two blinds we ordered - so missing skrews .
positive	received two home_trials with speedy delivery also had a query which was quickly and helpfully answered by staff .

neutral	so upset and looking everywhere for a cute hat that ties in with the outfit now that '_s not too dear :(
neutral	and some hair came off .
positive	every time i have use your company i have very good service , would recommend you to any one
neutral	i then got an email about three_weeks_later telling_me my item had been shipped .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time however the arrangement was nothing like the online picture and appeared to be a bit of a ' rush job '
neutral	however , upon reading the instructions on the tin i noted that it recommends application of a coat of normal por - 00 prior to applying their engine_enamel - this meant i had to place another order and pay for p_&_p a second time for a tin of standard por - 00 .
positive	everything i order is always delivered and in good time .
positive	some online_retailers just get it right .
positive	reasonable prices .
neutral	the 0nd bottled fared worse and even_though i '_ve been using the far less quantity ( equal to a finger_tip ) and following all instructions for usage & storage , have run out of foam in 00 days and what oozes out is just liquid .
negative	not good enough for me to use the company again , or recommend to friends or family .
negative	so i quizzed him about this and why it didnt state this in the 0 . 0 subheader and would it not make_sense to have put this piece of information in at this point but he did not respond and just reiterated subheader 0 . 0 .
negative	this company does not have a proper number to call !
positive	good service and products at a good price .
negative	we have managed to use the tracking device which was still in use on handset and shall be sending our proof of this been a fraudulent company to trading_standards as they still deny handling / received handset which evidently is not the case .
neutral	my order was fulfilled promptly but a mistake meant that one item was missed off the order and replaced by a ( random ) other item .

negative	i like to travel at 00 : 00 on a sunday , so when i could not book until an 00 : 00 on the monday_morning on the last occasion , i just suspected that the system was again at fault , and knowing that travel on previous ferry is permitted , i turned_up at 00 : 00 at dover , allowing plenty of time for jams on the road .
negative	anyone that is considering taking up the higher offer from bozowi should most definitely read all reviews first , i didn_'_t and it caused me more stressed than actually needed .
neutral	throughout i kept in touch with value basket by phone and email and they were always there to reassure me - i had read some horror_stories on the internet about their service which was causing me some concern .
positive	will definitely use the champagne company again .
negative	i wrote back to very customer service and got a call back from a polite lady_who_apologised for the inconvenience , but the only thing she could offer was to arrange another pick_up .
neutral	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it '_s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it '_s expected contents missing .
negative	lg call and sorted the problem in 00_hours .

negative	on friday at 0 . 00pm i had a missed call and voicemail_message_informing_me that my pool_table had been damaged in transit and alternatives would be to find something_else on their website or a refund .
neutral	i got a response which made no sense whatsoever so re emailed and never_heard back .
neutral	upon querying this was told that it would only be available to track once the parcel had left their warehouse .
neutral	slightly_disappointed in that having waited 00 weeks for delivery of our lounge suite and dining_table to find that one of the chairs was missing the feet , which now means we have to wait another 0 - 0_weeks for delivery of these items so we can use the chair .
positive	easy to use web_site , orders fulfilled quickly and despatched imediately

neutral	my on line buying experience was spoilt by the delivery service .

neutral	options were to change the electronic controller (£_000 ) and or the motor (£_000 ).
neutral	when i looked again at 0 . 00 the tracking stated the parcel could not be delivered and i had to phone to re - book a delivery time - not what i paid for !!
neutral	so it '_s on its way back to be replaced .
neutral	it '_s quite a heavy and bulky thing to carry home .
positive	would definitely recommend and use again .
positive	i had to buy a few components including wireless and the instructions from the manufacturer where in some cases not the easiest to understand .
positive	used before and would use again .
positive	highly_recommended !
negative	i was very happy with the flowers they looked very cheap something i could have brought from the supermarket for £_00 .
negative	!
negative	very very poor customer service .
neutral	i can '_t fault the communication from fashion_eyewear , but the first time they told me they had despatched my glasses , there was no such tracking_number with royal_mail and they had vanished into thin_air .
positive	recommended
neutral	they blamed their computer_systems .
neutral	could not polish it out and case was too big for the hassle of returning , so just turned it around so barely_noticeable .
neutral	i was most disappointed about this as it was a stock filler for my 00 year nephew .
positive	worth every_penny .
negative	what '_s the point in a quick delivery if i '_m now waiting days before it can be assembled ?
negative	the irony is that i sold some things on ebay because times are tough for everybody at the moment and i am out of pocket , ebay had their cut and paypal and i have to refund the recipient too !!
negative	they gave_me such a talk about a settings that wasn_'_t even there !
negative	hilarious , it was fine for me to hang_around all morning waiting for them to not deliver but inconvenient when i work full time for them to book a pick_up when i gave them a 0 hour_window . my summery would be never , never order from this company , they are a complete_joke with no customer service .
negative	gloxy uk have a huge issue with how they deal with customer issues .
positive	she was delighted with them and said they arrived well_packaged and in good condition .
negative	three_months later , i started experiencing issues with my samsung_s0 .
positive	not only is the range of products huge and varied , but the quality of service provided is excellent .
neutral	but on the positive_side i didn_'_t have a problem with any of my stuff going missing or being rejected so was paid in full .
negative	she told me the driver will be back by two .
positive	very happy customer .
negative	i did not receive a response to my email complaining re the above so therefore i cannot recommend this company .
negative	the guys at interparcel refused to try and help , refused to upgrade telling_me that actually " it is a non - guaranteed service ".
positive	i have already put one of my close friends in contact with polybags , because of their great value and very speedy delivery .
neutral	some company '_s can predict a day , time and drivers_name on there delivery '_s , i feel frost auto restorations could really benefit this kind of system , boy you would be smart then .
neutral	website was good , but the recommendations to go with the product were flawed .
neutral	however , the website search_functions could be improved .
negative	mine had a small scratch in a very distinct position on the screen - this one didn_'_t .
positive	i ordered my fitflops on a thursday & they had arrived by saturday unfortunately they sent the wrong_colour - no problem though i sent them back for free on the monday & received a replacement by wednesday .
negative	total con .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	the refund was received promptly 0_days_later .
negative	what a pointless delivery company .
neutral	very disappointed as i was told it would be there by friday .
negative	! they refuse to replace as they say it '_s got wet , what was i meant to use . will never use again and nor will my friends . most disappointed .
neutral	filling out numerous forms , just to send a single parcel took over 00_mins and then its tries to add hated 00p supplements for using paypal or a credit_card to pay .
positive	this error was nothing to do with you , but you rectified the error which is very high customer service .
negative	spent fifty pound on a voucher , could not contact vendor to redeem .
positive	very pleased .
neutral	good communication from the company , including estimated delivery date .
neutral	company emailed to say would be delivered 0 / 00 and that they would contact me again on 0 / 00 .
positive	very comfortable and great value for money .
positive	i bought it via normans ebay shop , selected standard free five day delivery .
negative	but !
positive	ordered some tape for a rotator cuff problem , arrived promtly , very good price , and helped shoulder alot .
neutral	haven_'_t even recieved my product yet so i can '_t quite comment on that , however it was an easy to use site and the despatching was quick . even_though i have got it yet !
negative	not a company i shall deal with again no matter_how easy they make purchasing on - line .
positive	ordered a pair of oakley_radar sunglasses at 0 :_00pm on friday and arrived before 00am the next_day .
negative	i called after 00 days , on a thursday and was told it should definitely be in by the next monday latest wednesday .
positive	quality product , speedy delivery .
neutral	website slow and not easy to navigate .
neutral	they replaced the lens as it was chipped when it fell out , but it took a very long time to get them returned , almost 0_weeks .
negative	i will not be purchasing from pixmania in the future .
neutral	i could not understand how they could have so many good reviews when they are so unhelpfull , and i revied them negatively ( but fairly ).
negative	probably wont use again .
positive	stupidly ordered wrong thing on line , so rang and they were very helpful and changed it for me and it arrived the next_day !
neutral	the biggest problem with online shopping , to my mind .
neutral	i did email some feedback but got no response to my issue .
positive	very good value for money just allow a bit of time for them to turn_up at home thay took longer_than i was inspeted
positive	another simple upgrade made easy by mr_memory '_s superb service .
neutral	might be fantastic .
positive	slotted the memory into my macbook and immediately up and running . no problem .
neutral	in the end i gave up trying to work out when my items would arrive .
neutral	the only_reason i ordered from this website is because i can not find the same invitations anywhere_else but i wont_be using the website again .
neutral	happy with the product when it arrived but feel company abuses pricing by pricing trophies low but then overloading the postage_costs .
neutral	will be adding material to hem of the dress to make it longer .
positive	constant_update from them and the courier firm even with a text_telling_me the drivers_name and an_hour delivery slot on the day of delivery .
positive	i will_definitely be using tooled_- up again .
positive	!
neutral	the reviews from other customers , added to the description of benefits and outcomes , encouraged me to make several first purchases .
negative	paid for 0 mb getting hardly 0mb .
negative	do not book with credit_card , you will be surcharged and they don_'_t tell you until after the booking is confirmed .
positive	these pills certainly help me to keep going .
positive	i would certainly use you again .
positive	never had any_problems .
neutral	i phoned ( reluctantly as it is not a free call ), got through easily to a " real " person to check whether my request had gone_through , which apparently it hadn_'_t .
neutral	i did eventually work it out but it had now taken 0 days which was much longer_than the acquisition process .
negative	on contacting the company we were asked whether we had used recorded mail .
positive	many_thanks to all concerned !
negative	really disappointed with this and embarrassed by them .
positive	very impressive .
negative	on gumtree it '_s a free for all where there are no rules and potential_buyers have a free reign .
positive	it arrived today so very well_packaged .
neutral	i found it online for £_00 . service was ok just over priced !
positive	so easy to order and cards are beautiful .
negative	will go_elsewhere nextime
positive	equally , delivery at a time of my choosing didn_'_t incur the additional_costs that one would normally associate with this service .
neutral	disappointed that i will have to chase it up .
neutral	however , the fact that i then had responsibility of returning the unwanted grout myself really annoyed me and has left me out of pocket .
positive	it '_s so easy on here to order the prescription food my cats love and need . price is right and delivery is free .
neutral	sending out said upgrade boards without wiring diagrams
negative	luckily the buyer was happy enough to live with it as the side wasn_'_t in view .
negative	so i write to sky on three_separate_occasions explaining this and receive one unsatisfactory call in response , therefore ignoring two other letters asking for information .
neutral	they had both my phone number and email on record .
negative	their customer service was 000 x better .
positive	ordered and delivered the next_day .
positive	excellent service , would highly_reccomend
negative	charming .
positive	however , i recieved the full_amount for both of the phones i sent in and received the cheque the day immediately after they received the phone .
negative	she said it would be about £_000 -£_000 to send down so i got on the case .
positive	i would recommend this site to others as the price was also very competitive
neutral	they are good , but they don_'_t sell everything i need .
positive	definitely use you again .
positive	truly an amazing product at an amazing price .
positive	second time ive_used this website , easy to use and good prices .
negative	nealry three_weeks and i still_haven_'_t received my order of one printed mug .
negative	i was reassured by this is i thought i ' d try an sell something .
negative	tried sending a message through the returns_form on the website but have no idea if it got through .
neutral	food for thought - pay the extra £ 0 a month or so to get the plan on a better operator .
positive	this was more than a fair compensation !
negative	back in november ordered a sofa from these_clowns .
negative	. £_000 is lot out of my pension for nothing in return .
neutral	a good product and procook very professional but the delivery was not as straightforward and i would not recommend yodel as a carrier
neutral	purchased a cool shirt for the husband by two stoned .
neutral	when i eventually got through the physioroom , i could not exchange the item there and then , i had to return the item first , wait for a refund then re order it again .
positive	order placed immediately .
neutral	i bought the regency boy costume - it stated white shirt with collar , actually received a collar .
negative	never again !!!!
negative	when the printer had not arrived 0 days_later i called them to enquire it '_s whereabouts .
negative	do not agree to anything on the phone until you see all their ambiguous terms and conditions or you will be trapped into their 00 month plan .
neutral	then 0_weeks_later received a shipped email with dhl .
positive	couldn_'_t have been a more pleasureable_experience !!
positive	i then needed to check some discrepancy in the details about delivery .
positive	excellent jacket , brilliant price and delivery within_00hrs .
negative	advice ; do not buy from pet_supermarket .
positive	wash and wear well .
negative	asos still seem to allow sellers to sell items even_though the response by the customers reflects that the items they are receiving are incorrect and unable to be returned when they have been given no warning about this .
neutral	order taken swiftly and acknowledged by email .
negative	i didn_'_t feel that officenerd really cared whether my order ever replied or not and their constant efforts to get me to accept a refund seemed to be an attempt to get me off their case rather_than an example of good customer service .
positive	good product , delivered quickly and a query i had was followed up in a timely_manner .
positive	safesigs is great .
positive	their products are a great quality and value .
positive	i have been very pleased with the speed of delivery on all orders , hope this continous .
positive	had a issue with one pair not having the " reading " side of the prescription , i contacted glasses_direct and they asked me to return them .
neutral	sent 0 phones and only got paid for 0 but issue was quickly resolved when i called to complain
negative	i thought that was pretty lame but i couldn_'_t really say anything because she gave a very forceful air of " i don_'_t care ".
negative	so now have no battery as it has_been returned to yourselves and i have 0 battery chargers so a very costly experience
negative	the top panel of the vanity_unit is swelling up and cracking presumably due to humidity in the bathroom .
positive	brilliant service .
negative	i would even have accepted a handling_fee .
negative	what a joke !
neutral	there was a table_tennis_table as advertised but it was jammed in to a small space with no room to hit anything other than perhaps your elbows !
positive	got clear advice over the phone from helpful and informative staff .
positive	after wearing the biofocals for a week i found they were giving me headaches as the reading element of the glasses was too high so i emailed them and within 00_hours the opticion had rang me and discussed the problem he asked for the glasses to be returned and corrected the problem at no extra_charge to me .
positive	thanks colin
neutral	otherwise , a nice arrangement
neutral	packaged nicely .
neutral	um !
neutral	over_£_000 taken out of my account and nothing received
negative	!.
negative	the gadget / device must turn on and off
positive	no " losing " my funds for a week to generate interest on my transfer , exchange_rates which cannot be_beaten , instant communication , what more do i need ?
positive	i '_ve bought a few_times from ao online . never had a problem and they are always the first place i look . normally the cheapest aswell . free delivery is a major plus . i would always recommend
neutral	0 / 00
neutral	i sent all the info again , but our weekend was ruined .
neutral	also found the £ 0 fee on top of each mug for the transfer to be a hidden cost as this was not made clear until payment
neutral	the parcel was duly redelivered but i had to eat humble_pie when the postlady pointed_out that all that was showing on the parcel was my address and no other instructions !
positive	i was looking for decorations for my daughter '_s 00th_birthday_party and came_across partyrama .
neutral	the selling part was very easy .
positive	flowers were delivered on time , i was informed , i am very happy :)
negative	prices paid are hardly_ever the same , the dfds system is often faulty , and offers continually change .
neutral	furthermore i specified a date for delivery for mothers_day and they were delivered the day before .
neutral	after suggesting the same item in another colour it was added .
negative	the broadband_connection is so poor that in the late evening it struggles to stream anything .
positive	i still cant quite believe_how quickly it arrived at my door .
negative	i '_m not holding my breath - the number their 0000 number forwards to has_been disconnected , and the live_chat remains offline at all hours .
neutral	however it was disappointing that the canvas was allowed to leave in this condition , but these things_happen i guess .
neutral	will it arrive tomorrow ?
positive	item was well_packaged and good quality for what we paid , my son was very happy with it .
negative	i insisted on seeing this new policy as i was sure they cant just add policies without informing the customer , none were forthcoming .
negative	i was livid when i opened the box and saw how little there was in there , and i bought it at a sale price of just over_£_00 .
positive	could not fault this company at all .
negative	this is really a classic scenario when things go_wrong , you would be left in this time and money wasting triangle relationship crescent electronic has very successfully implied .
neutral	however i recently received a bouquet - amazonia , ordered in australia , which was very impressive but did not contain all the flowers listed in the details or on the video_clip !
negative	they said it should be with me shortly .
negative	i have used groupon for years and not had any_problems until recently , and the way it '_s been handled has only aggravated me further .
negative	my job takes me away from my hometown and although im not strugling for money i would have been looking at taking a new contract last_week , yet im still stuck here with no answers , not even replys to my emails
neutral	booked online to save 00 or 00 quid which was good .
positive	better_than ebay
negative	i moved_into my new build property on the 00th_october_0000 .
negative	now 0_weeks on my ' new phone ' has had to be sent off again for the exact_same problem only this time when i went into the store the sales_advisor told me it was a ' common fault ' on the specific model i had , clearly upset i asked was there anything i could do even suggested paying more to my existing contract to change the model phone ( which i shouldnt have to seeing as the model they sold me on a 00 month contact hasnt even lasted 00 and was malfunctioning as of its own accord and not my fault ) to which i was told to basically ring o0 customer_services and ' kick off '.
positive	have used partyrama before and will use again .
positive	mike
positive	excellent service - ordered a replacement bathroom_extractor_fan and it arrived the next_day .
positive	thank_you so so much !
positive	brilliant service oak_worktop arrived in perfict condition no knocks or dent really helpfull delivery guys . well recomended a +++
positive	superfast service , expert packaging and perfect product - very impressed .
negative	i am very disappointed with the service you have provided throughout this entire shipping process .
neutral	it was a mess that could have been avoided if the containers used were properly sealed before shipping .
neutral	two major problems have arisen to stop this being such a good service - the new airport stipulated approach of customers leaving their cars on 0th_floor , is not as good as being dropped_off and picked_up outside_departures is one problem .
neutral	can '_t blame them for being fed_up but the delivery was rather abrupt as a result .
neutral	i expected so much from this company but sadly , their customer service sadly let them down .
positive	very good service .
neutral	however the next_day delivery service wasn_'_t as good as i ' d_hoped , ordered on a monday_night and parcel arrived on the thursday !
neutral	i paid for the next_day delivery the courier did not come to my address or leave a card as stated , i had to ring them & sort_out the delivery .
positive	it arrives a few_days_later very well secured and packaged .
positive	v quick delivery
positive	j ' ai_commandé 0 articles et_la_commande a été livrée en deux fois .
negative	my domain_name off line for 00 days i you cannot do nothing about it with 000 - reg .
neutral	i took it to post_office again but i still had to pay £ 0 . 00 .
positive	excellent speedy service !
negative	so , do you really get a 0 year parts warranty ?
negative	!
neutral	i put all my details on the order form and did not write anything to do with jason ford .
neutral	when i asked why he hadn_'_t called he said the bell wasn_'_t working , which was untrue .
positive	for otc ( over the counter ) goods chemist_direct are fast and reliable .
negative	and don_'_t you dare respond to this saying ' send us an email ' - i know for a fact you won_'_t reply .
positive	found cheapsmells from google who had aftershave at about £ 0 cheaper_than other_websites and postage was free .
neutral	upon return , the company '_s phone was unavailable for a while , which is pretty scary .
positive	anyway well pleased will recommend to any one
neutral	all food items i have had , have been great .
positive	your service cant be_beaten , our order was lunch - time , one day , delivered next_morning brilliant , ive yet to find any - one to beat that .
neutral	on purchasing the bass_guitar , the guitar itself was what i wanted and good value , however the included amplifier was not up to the job .
neutral	this was our second trip with dfds , the last being september last_year !
positive	great selection , got everything .
positive	!
negative	do they really think they get away with this crap ?
negative	they accused me of lying and then two_days_later i got a parcel back with the phone inside .
positive	cheque received in a couple of days after despatch .
negative	flowers were not delivered .
neutral	spoke to a customer service agent who was a bit cold , but factual .
neutral	however , the real_test will come if i ever have to claim and then we '_ll see how good they are .
neutral	fabulous delivery time , great drinks but you need to sort_out your extremely un - environmentally_friendly packing methods .
positive	i was phoned to offer me earlier_than requested delivery date .
positive	definately_use this at every opportunity
positive	i was very pleased with my first order of pens and have just placed a second .
negative	thought i would have a look to see what trustpilot was after_hearing about it from a colleague so i signed_up to take a look .
neutral	it took a phone_call to sort this out .
positive	but not only you can track with a number on their site , the arrival '_s time and have more details but also at 0 am i got a call from a machine telling_me they would be here before 00 am .
negative	it '_s really rare i am disappointed enough to take valuable time writing a negative_review , but . parcel0go may be fine if your parcel arrives ok but if it does not , then best of luck trying to resolve the problem .
negative	they did not answer mine or paypal emails and so batteries - trade . co . uk should be avoided at all costs .
negative	they need to work out their stock_levels and list it live on the website to avoid further inconvenience to customers .
neutral	. us vinyl junkies like paper and card_sleeves for every record !!
positive	lovely machine and a real_bargain at £_00 - delighted with the free gift - 00 reels of quality cottons !
positive	the advice i was give by the chap at rdk made it all so
neutral	new home , auntie etc .
positive	my friends and i had been thinking of fun times when we were younger .
negative	to just cancel the delivery without informing us i am sure you will agree it is totally_unacceptable .
negative	i got back from holiday thinking they were going to be at my house but they weren_'_t .
positive	i would use this store again without a doubt and would recommend to others to do so too .
neutral	overall not a great success , needs to be clearer on website and before ordering , just glad these are free and i didn_'_t waste money .
negative	i ordered a bouquet from iflorist on thursday 00th_september_0000 for delivery next_day ( and paid for this ) the next_day no delivery turned_up despite taking my money .
negative	had to go away - fitter found a hole in bottom of shower_cubicle box when he lifted it off the pallet with glass pieces trickling out - photographed it and rang and to ask about returning easy plumb tray - told to ring back monday - went through rigmoroll again and eventually the following friday another cubicle delivered .
positive	looked high and low for the right under unit lighting for our kitchen and was surprised at the limited range within the actual market .
neutral	all went well until i got to the payment page when the confirmation page froze so i was unsure_whether i ' d paid , or paid more than once .
positive	excellent range of goods on offer , easy to use website including payment and goods arrived very quickly .
positive	i returned it and a replacement was arranged within 00_hours , no_quibble - again great communication .
negative	it is now one week_later and still nothing and no reponse from iflorist still .
positive	because of the distance i was travelling that day they handled everything and kept me informed by email .
neutral	the box is damaged and the engraved plate is on skuwiff
negative	i will update all events on this site !!
positive	arrived next_day with text_message updates me as to where the parcel was . all in all a superb service !
neutral	the outward_trip was not as advertised in that we had paid for a two bed cabin with sea_view .
positive	he was always friendly and helpful but i always got the very comfortable feeling that he cared .
negative	had them delivered to a friend in uk who forwarded them to me in france and then i had to return them as they were so awful .
positive	i would use the company again they had lots of different flowers to choose from .
negative	eleven days after ordering the phone i checked the status of my order on their website only to discover that my order had not even been dispatched .
neutral	smells of scammy .
negative	the rsvp_cards were pre printed , however we required a c / o address on them , when we received the card we indeed had a care off ( typed in full ) on them , but as time was of an essence , we could not afford to return the cards to bride_& groom for re printing .
neutral	i think what made me nervous throughout this process was that my money was taken straight_away , but no estimated delivery date was provided , other than a vague assurance from the customer_services team there .
positive	would definitely use again .
neutral	i won_'_t go into the specifics but i will say that after that conversation three and i were best budies again .
neutral	so all we get are positive_reviews which is as good as worthless
negative	a very angry ( and very probably ) ex customer
neutral	i thought this car_park had number_plate recognition , maybe it does but i didn_'_t understand the entry system fully and just pressed for a ticket .
positive	well_done snakey .
neutral	nice tiles , god value .
positive	i would definitely recommend them and would be coming_back to hd or more electronic household good when the time comes .
negative	maybe so , but have you seen the amount of tickets they send you ?
neutral	i would say pick a size larger than you need , but again , the larger_sizes are limited .
neutral	we returned it in firenze where the staff were excellent .
negative	look at the huge number of appalling reviews for this company and make up your own mind as to their true level of customer service .
negative	over a week went by and i hadn_'_t heard a thing , so i called them and was informed that it was under manufacturers_warranty , so i had to take it to a vauxhall dealership and they would replace it free of charge .
negative	no explanation and no attempt to fullfil the order .
neutral	when i picked_up the bike , the last thing they did was screw the old peddles into the new chain set peddle shafts .
negative	received a text at 0am saying the item would be delivered between_0am - 0pm .
neutral	amazing service - item ordered saturday and arrived monday .
neutral	won_'_t use site in future - will pay cash in shop and swipe card .
neutral	thought they would be bigger , seemed a lot of green in the bouquet so bit overpriced for what was there .
negative	i attempted to buy a washing_machine on line , it was imperative that i had it delivered the next_day .
neutral	on 00th , based on your mail sent on 00th of apr i was supposed to pick_up the car at 00 : 00 from europcar , as per your e_- mail information .
negative	one is a fridge_freezer , and due to argos ' utter incompetence , she is losing a significant_amount of money every day because she is having to waste food as she has nowhere to store it .
positive	i '_ve been really impressed with my order , it arrived when promised and the quality is excellent , making it great value for money .
positive	it was priced well , the packaging was good and the delivery time just what i needed .
positive	its a dublin dog problem but pet_planet are ok
negative	so no i would not recommend them to anyone as i don_'_t trust them
positive	fantastic service - delivery uk to hk took just four working_days .
negative	absolutely_disgraceful .
negative	nothing at all like the bouquet i ordered .
positive	looking on the internet for my dogs_medication which company shall i go with well i chose viovet didnt know much about them i gave them ago and never looked back everything about them is first_class i would recomend them to everybody so be like me and give them ago you will never find a better company that cares for your_pets_needs
neutral	i was trying to explain my problem but as soon as she clicked on to the issue , she interrupted me so i couldn_'_t finish what i was saying .
positive	that i could create an account so easily , also meant that i could follow the progress of the order , not that i felt anything other that fully assured of its ' safe and timely completion .
positive	mazuma never let_me down .
negative	why does the company have phone lines that either get cut_off or never answered ?
neutral	i '_m just one .
positive	and they are always friendly and helpful no - matter what . you get the impression you are dealing_with friends not suppliers .
neutral	as i have dealt_with this company before and had no problem i decided to ignore the advice and proceed with an order .
positive	just tried mypareldelivery . com for the first time and i highly_recommend them .
negative	whats needed here is competition folks
negative	they didn_'_t .
positive	thank_you so much for a trouble free service !
positive	no_fuss .
neutral	on contacting the company , they confirmed with outback that all the covers supplied are green - the grey ones are exported ?
positive	ordered and received by return post well_packed and with fitting_instructions , coud ' nt be made easier .
negative	if i don_'_t get a satisfactory response i will take this further .
neutral	we got in touch with customer service , after one week , the above answer is what we got .
neutral	not that bothered but the windscreen could at_least have been washed .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	get a life !
negative	entire system is utterly ridiculous , going round and round in circles .
negative	customer_services told me it was despatched on 00 april by royal_mail 0nd_class but i will have to wait another week before they will look into it for me .
negative	these arms were replacements for the same arms , ordered from easygates 0 ( ish_) years previously .
positive	soft_close loo_seat .
negative	so presumably i now have to claim on my insurance and get it replaced ?
negative	however , even with a faulty mast apparently all you need to do is turn our phone on / off , go into flight mode blah_blah_blah zzzzzzzzzzz .
positive	the communication i have received so far in joining the company has_been second to none , the lady was very helpful .
neutral	however , unfortunately , my order was sent to the wrong_address and was lucky my neighbour was in to receive the product .
positive	i was so impressed , i knew there would be extra shipping as i was in the channel_islands but as it turned_out the vat refund was more than the shipping cost so i woke_up to find a refund in my paypal_account already !
neutral	i was therefore surprised to receive the larger cover .
positive	all in all an excellent company .
positive	off road driving in total safety .
negative	i placed the order online and added a note to the order reiterating the importance of delivery within 0 days and requesting that if this were not possible i should be contacted immediately .
negative	we wait but any joy has now gone as can we really trust them to do a good job ?
neutral	the lenses on this delayed order then had to be remade so an order that should have taken a week took over a month .
neutral	customer service is fast and pleasantly polite & helpful but i cannot_afford to purchase too much at one time being inhibited by income .
positive	best phone company ive dealt_with .
negative	however the second cooler was not cancelled and i received a rudely written reply to my ticket implying that i do not read my e_- mails .
positive	communication was great , i was given a time and date for collection .
negative	it strikes me that florists are one of those groups of businesses that pretty_much have to get it right .
negative	also nearly_missed plane because the admin of purchasing a boarding card took so long .
positive	therefore i have changed the customer name at the bottom of this feedback request .
negative	however , when looking today , i saw they haven_'_t even put this on my account !
positive	have used dapw on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed with their service or the quality of their goods .
positive	so easy to fit up on window as come already strung and on track .
neutral	i was looking for a new hdmi_cable as i wanted to improve the picture on my tv .
neutral	my order was dispatched later than it should '_ve been as they were awaiting stock ( despite the website showing in stock at the time i ordered ).

positive	i was so impressed i immediately wrote an_email to your customer_services to tell them how wonderful the company is !
negative	the only time you got in contact was when i raised a paypal claim !

positive	the best delivery i even had .
neutral	this item ( ps00u compressor ) i purchased for £_000 which was a really good deal but it must have been on back order .

neutral	it took us hours to unpack a wardrobe , we had bits of cardboard and small beads of polystyrene everywhere .
neutral	not really satisfied .
neutral	but got no response .
positive	item just as_described and great value !

positive	she is pleased with the fit and has taken them back to college with her .
negative	i was told that the bike is still in the warehouse as they have no drivers avaliable , yet this has now changed - apparently it '_s in a delivery van & will be spending the next week travelling around with the delivery driver before delivery - and it can '_t be cancelled .
positive	unfortunately i realised this too late for a bespoke ring so rang up to see what options i had .
positive	i was going to throw the old hands free phones away & buy new but i decided to purchase some new rechargeable_batteries , hey_presto the phones are like new again .

negative	i was told that the talktalk box was as good as sky and that i could get the sky channels for a little extra each_month , i was also promised hundreds of on demand movies and the ability to pause and rewind live tv , after waiting 0_weeks to get the package confirmed because twice talktalk had made mistakes while ordering the equipment etc ( should have know then ) i told them to cancel the contract i had decided to leave but they promised it would be easier if i stayed with them instead of having to move from one to the other .
positive	received my order in unbelievable time , was worried that the miele bags wouldn_'_t fit as they are such a good price , but they do !
negative	any decent company would have offered an_hour delivery slot to minimise the inconvenience they had caused .
positive	i know where to go when i need perfume for my lady
negative	i now have to explain to my little_boy that the present he has longed for for months will not be replaced and , as uk_sport imports are refusing to give us a refund for this faulty purchase , we cannot_afford to buy him a new one .
neutral	won_'_t use again unless paying by debit_card .
neutral	if i knew it was going to be that difficult for them then i would have gone somewhere_else .
positive	i got free delivery and it arrived earlier_than i thought so the service is good as well .
negative	the first order contained a copy of microsoft windows 0 and a cooler_master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
neutral	as i live in france i had given my friends ' address for delivery i didn_'_t even know that the items hadn_'_t been delivered and there was no further communication to say that they hadn_'_t been despatched .
neutral	shame you have to shout about your bad_experience on here before they take things seriously .
positive	unbelievable .
negative	what ?!
neutral	ordering was very easy and acknowledgment and dispatch very speedy but cannot_comment on the goods as have not yet recieved them
negative	we cancelled the order using their online form , we know they got the cancellation because someone from dell phoned us to ask if there was anything they could do to persuade us to change our_minds .
negative	no communication .
neutral	this time though , delivery took 00 days and we were without the blinds after moving in .
negative	eventually , i received my refund on 00 / 00 /_0000 , a lot longer_than 00 days .

neutral	either way my pc is working great .
neutral	well i ordered a subwooffer cable late one night after reviwing various other_sites mainly_because they had a short length cable i required as some other_sites only had cables that were far to long for my needs anyway lo and behold it arrived by post 00_hours_later needless to say i was delighted at the service

negative	have now had 0 couriers accept my delivery - one cancelled as they had underquoted - still_waiting refund on deposit - second one cancelled on day of collection no reason given .
negative	i paid_extra for a sunday delivery also .
neutral	my only_disappointment is in the packaging of some of the fragile items . for instance the plastic cups i ordered were all broken on delivery and serviette papers were opened and scattered in the box . this was promptly resolved . delivery time was excellent and prompt . would recommend to anyone but please_note that packaging of goods to customers are greatly_improved especially those with free delivery . thank_you
negative	by this time i was fuming .
neutral	beautiful flowers every time .
negative	the company did reply_saying ' thats fine ' but questions were unanswered - hence a long and expensive telephone_call prior to placing order .
negative	if you ' re lucky_enough to actually receive your parcel , chances are it '_ll be in a sorry_state - everything i '_ve had from them i '_ve returned to sender , probably due to being loaded & unloaded multiple_times from the mystery delivery van ( s ) that operate through edinburgh city_centre .
negative	this has not been done as i have received this email asking me to rate my experience and hoping i have been happy with my recent order !
positive	whenever i have a worry_about a light , brake , tyre or anything like that i pop_into f0 and they tell me if i need to do anything about it or not - often , there isn_'_t any work that needs doing so i '_m fairly confident they don_'_t get me to pay for unnecessary work .
negative	i phoned customer_services ( 00_minutes of which 00 were on hold ) and the customer service rep was fairly useless .
negative	why_bother , save your money and look_elsewhere .
neutral	my husband couldnt understand what they sent us either .

negative	london , nw0 0fb
neutral	i was given updates on my order via_email and text and told when they reached my friend .
positive	they were deliverd on time however , after wearing them for a few_days i realised that inside one boot , at the heel , there was a ' nail ' or something protruding - this only became_apparent after a few_days wear due to the cushioned insole and was obviously a manufacturing_fault .
negative	i have been trying to get a refund on the 00 day terms of refund . customer service is hopless . and unhelpfullhave been misinformed about returning item to store . for refund . not straight_forward as led to belive wasted hours going back to store to get this refund , still trying
positive	excellent product , excellent price , excellent delivery , what more do you need ?!
positive	quick delivery - great quality goods
negative	it was not dispatched so will have to wait to see if going to be refunded .

neutral	we are a large half timbered tudor style build with two restaurants and a six letting rooms above ; drivers have to drive past us to travel through the village , and as the delivery driver is supposed to leave a card indicating that ‘ they had tried but failed to make delivery ’ and didn_’_t .
neutral	o_serviço_de_entrega é deficiente por haver trocas de morada constantemente .
negative	they asked me to take the car to kwik_fit who replaced the headlamp bulb , free of charge .
negative	this sort of thing should be outlawed
neutral	it is two_weeks_later i am still_waiting :(
neutral	i really think rollersnakes should use collect_plus , would have been much_easier .
negative	i know how sagepay works , and the powerdirect representative was lying .
negative	poor attitude from rude staff - who said they did not wish to be rude but .!!!
neutral	it therefore looked scruffy , not what i expected and the overall experience was disappointing which was a pity as i am sure the firm are usually better and will also be disappointed with my comments
neutral	the site was great , but the difference in quotes was phenominal .
negative	i have emailed redspottedhanky a complaint so i will update in due course .
neutral	i '_ll be hesitant to place another order because of this .
negative	i just had my licence renewal through ,,, it seems the bbc in an effort to save_money will no_longer be sending out tv licences ,, they just keep on record the fact you have paid ,, now that is the ultimate in bad customer service ,,
negative	arrived early ( not hours but as is a new comedy show & in maidstone didn_'_t expect it to be inundated .)
positive	ordered using my iphone while out , keys delivered within a day or so .
positive	overall , a very good service and not only have i kept the link as a ' favourite ' for future use , i am happy to recommend offtek to anyone trying to source memory_modules .
negative	this never arrived ; after emailing again i was told another pack had been sent .
neutral	that said , the products are generally good value for money .
negative	their origin service is atrocious , their downloadable content schemes pathetic , and their respect for gamers nowhere to be found .
positive	ordered my revos and received them within 0 days .
neutral	efficient carrier usually same driver delivers at around the same time of day .
positive	i would be happy to recommend them to anyone .
neutral	you have the option to do this online , so why they feel the need to phone you up in respect of this was baffling .
negative	upon_opening the box i thought that someone had replaced the bouquet from the local_garage .
negative	they couldn_'_t refund it unless i sent an_email to cancel .
positive	the management company charges £_00 for a new remote and you have to make yourself available on a weekday to have it programmed .
negative	so on the 0th do december requested my iphone 0 to be unlocked so i could use my
negative	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
neutral	i though the software was good and quite straight_forward to use , but when i received the book i was a bit dissapointed with a few of the larger pictures and they were blurred and almost out of focus ( it must be where you make them larger the quality is worst ) i could not see this on my copy on screen as i would not have processed the order if i could see that the larger pictures were like this as it has spoilt the overall book .
positive	the process of putting in my personal photos was easy and the finished card , when it arrived , was superb .
neutral	the price was excellent ( there was a sale on when i ordered ) and they arrived very quickly .
positive	it was tasty & easy to prepare .
neutral	a parcel did arrive but it wasnt mine so i rang your office and it was arranged for the parcel to be picked_up and my parcel was to be picked_up from the lady in london that it went by mistake that was on friday so i would expect to recieve my parcel sometime this week
positive	the
positive	i get money straight_away on line with no waiting around to speak to anyone .
neutral	lastly i was not pleased to find myself charged 00_euros for a full_tank of petrol .
neutral	they took_ages to attempt to resolve the problem but were ultimately unsuccessful .
negative	it is false_advertising .
negative	as a 00 year_old student who has just moved across the world from canada to the uk , trying to find the easiest routes in the most effective and inexpensive way is very valuable to me .
neutral	however , i did continue with the booking in the hope that the price doesn_'_t double when i finally learn how much the baggage will add .
positive	you just need a computer and printer for the delivery note and free_postage_label i was totally amazed_at how quickly everything went through .
neutral	so my aim was to cancel the service on the day of purchase , thus giving the company the 00 days notice they required .
positive	the staff were friendly and helpful when i spoke to them on the phone .
neutral	from a usability perspective our full width sofa_bed is great and it came at an unmatchable price .
positive	very satisfied with service and price .
positive	i have used speed_graphic for several_years and have always had great service - both in price and delivery .
neutral	often i give up and use the phone .
positive	very pleased with all my purchases all working well , no hassell . this just so important .
negative	their products are of poor quality and after returning for a refund they ignored me , refused to acknowledge the return despite me having tracking evidence and did not refund me .
neutral	only 0 purple ones and alot of greenery .
negative	the guy in the shop tried to scan the barcode today , and after_reading the email from hut_group and double_checking the attached return form , said that the label they sent me is incorrect .
neutral	what is wrong with giving a full_tank and return full ?
neutral	the card arrived and was just a folded piece of card with no heart image with my message , so feel a bit misled .
negative	the inc club was closed so we called customer_services from 0 . 00pm we were trying and each time we were left on hold for 00_minutes finally we got through at 0 . 00 and only to our shock were told our nearest_collection_point was victoria .
negative	this is apparently your reason for not posting its eh00kww0y0sb0h .
positive	from the initial_contact to installation of the equiptment .
neutral	i asked why they hadn_'_t rung me to find out where i was .
negative	this is blatant theft .
neutral	the radiator and valves arrived promptly and i was kept well informed re delivery but in fact the valves were the wrong sort - i ordered straight valves but in fact wall type valves were sent .
positive	wide_selection of products
positive	on pick_up my baggage was delayed but with constant_communication i was picked_up within five_minutes
negative	i ordered a cart mount for my gps which was sent promptly - that '_s the good bit .
negative	i contacted them yet again on friday 0th_march , nearly one month after ordering only to be told that they didn_'_t know when goods would be received .
negative	i didnt think there would be , as i have booked with you before and i know that if it is an e_- ticket there is nothing you can really do if you mess it up !
negative	the customer service lady .( name ) ( sp ?)
positive	really nice product , good value for the quality .
positive	easy to order , good communication , fast delivery and a good quality product
neutral	had an enjoyable stay here at the dutchman hotel breakfast nice didn_'_t eat here but the food smelt lovely when we arrived overall would recommend if you like 0 * ratings then maybe this isn_'_t the hotel for you .
negative	!
positive	very well_packaged .
negative	i ordered a front and rear mud guard and i only got a rear mud guard , even_though they showed a front and rear in the picture and in the describtion .
negative	i ordered goods 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i then bought two halloween_costumes - 0 psycho ward which we actually sent back because it was so badly made and the mask that came with it was not at all like the picture and when we tried to wear it , it didn_'_t mould to your face and was actually painful to wear .
positive	the ripstik was fine .
positive	i was recommended to these_guys by a friend who had used them and i wasn_'_t disappointed .
positive	dfds verry good i recomend to everyone who like travel
negative	very poor .
neutral	the floor and walls were also covered in dust .
negative	so i suggest to people not to trust there review site .
negative	the car was in the custody of evans_halshaw from 0 . 00am to 0pm .
negative	but my husband is scratching his head at these boards .
neutral	the advice i have received is that the initial comment mr fernandes had used stating i had used a " lie ", amended to " not quite true " and then further amended to " not true " remains defamatory .
positive	my friend lisa has had a lot of problems getting her dogs the products she needs via a ' hassle_free ' company !
negative	payment was taken immediately , but did not even receive a confirmation e_- mail of the order .
positive	i will definitely recommend this firm to others .
negative	dont touch them with a barge_pole , the old saying you only get what you pay for works with this company .
positive	the quality of the items and the price will make me buy again from you .
neutral	luckily i '_d ordered plenty and it didn_'_t impact on getting the job_done .
neutral	the email providing status_updates on the progress of the customers order , is a nice_touch .
positive	which will give your brain cells a good work out .
positive	pleasant , helpful and obliging from order_placement to final delivery and assembly .
neutral	delivery was speedy .
neutral	company prides_itself on own delivery vehicles but is unable to provide more than a 00 hour delivery window .
neutral	also , the 0 different ones i ordered don_'_t look like the pic shown on website . i know they take a few_days to open up though so maybe will look as nice then =)
negative	their upbeat website gives the impression of a company that will deliver - and quickly .
positive	an easy site to navigate_around , simple to order and the paypal option makes it safe & secure to pay .
neutral	i was quite annoyed at this point cos it was a birthday_present that was meant to be for monday .
positive	the only improvement would be some options of what to do with the chargers , just a recommended recycle / donate option would make some more space in the cupboard !
negative	placed an order on the 00st of october , still_waiting for my stuff despite qualifying for next_day delivery .
positive	the whole_process from signing_up to receiving my cheque took less_than a working week and i cannot_fault a single stage of the process .
positive	never had to claim , but feel re - assured they ' d be on the case .
positive	thanks to all at power_tools .
positive	order with confidence .
negative	i would not recommend using argos for any item which requires delivery unless you like surprises and are willing to wait and see when your item will finally arrive .
positive	i love that they sell elho products which are quite difficult to buy in this country and yet they are some of the best on the market .
positive	when the website ' same day service '.
positive	it was let within a week .
neutral	the products are excellent value for money , but size variability is a problem that tends to limit what i buy .
neutral	but beware of network_coverage
neutral	would i order from here again ?
positive	you have to wait_till the sale ends so no good if you are in a hurry .
neutral	make the chicken / meat dishes with less sauce and more meat .
positive	got refunded within a day or so .
negative	i have also contacted_watchdog and explained the situation > please report them if you are disappointed with the service , so we can stop another family_members day being ruined !!
neutral	all in all it had given good service and deserved retirement .
positive	very happy , requested a bag an got one the next_day !
positive	our thin countersunk ndfeb magnets were nicely_presented and seem very good quality .
neutral	i emailed kiren_parcelhero to ask what was going on , but received no answer .
negative	i would urge_people to avoid using chemist_direct .
neutral	!
negative	your offer of a refund is unacceptable as we would then be unable to see the commonwealth games .
negative	the same emails went back and forth for a few_days and then i got an email_saying it had been despatched anyway just in case i changed my mind when it was on the way . why would i change my mind when i ' d been trying to cancel it !!!
positive	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use again .
negative	once again received an_email_saying item on way and then an_email requesting feedback but not actually received my order !
negative	beware of this company , 0 items they sent me were broken , because i had paid for the items and not on account , they were not interested , parcels never arrived , i had to chase_up yodel , as they would not !!!!
neutral	the london traffic was busy even then , which_meant it would have taken 0 hours to go round half the red loop to get from westminster to hamleys , so we walked instead .
negative	my next move is to demand the return of my money .
neutral	stayed in all day and waited .
negative	after many emails and telephone_conversations at my expense , it is now friday and it is now being collected but that is not the end of it .
positive	i usually start by looking around the rates available in local banks and travel_agents , then return to ace and have the currency posted to me at what i have assured myself is a better rate .
positive	i would not_hesitate to use this site again and would recommend it to others
positive	thanks
neutral	if you ’ re not going to be in for the 00 hour collection window , the mm website offers very few characters for collection arrangements , “ in the side alley ” is about all you ’ ll get in and then the disinterested guy from hermes fails to collect from the side alley .
negative	i '_ll be royal_mail are glad that they are providing their services for free .
positive	amazing service , ordered over the bank_holiday_weekend and it arrived on the tuesday !
neutral	needed them urgently for a ski_trip , so paid air freight delivery !
neutral	speedy free delivery on their many products .
neutral	the breakfasts were lovely and the staff we met were pleasant .
positive	when you go on comparison_sites sometimes you can get more money for your phone but then they knock money for stupid little things like scratches you get half what you expected .
negative	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
neutral	i have since printed copies myself and they are fine , so dont understand what the problem was .
positive	they always have great offers and booking is painless .
negative	the council won_'_t come out and check there dish and there telling_me to pay for a 0rd_party engineer to come and sort this out , it '_s an_absolute_joke , the customer service is diabolical , no one wants to help you , they talk over you and just keep saying the same thing as in there reading off a script , that '_s the overseas contact centre and the uk_based ones ,
negative	a number of times previously and now due to this experience doesnt may me want to use eflorist again .
neutral	i got a message on a web_page ( i don_'_t know how i ended_up on that page ) to say there was a problem with my account and gave an 0000 number to ring .
neutral	delivery of 0 to 0 days is unacceptable in these days of next_day delivery .
negative	cancelled my order in the end , though i had to go to group on for the voucher and them for the delivery fee .
positive	can '_t ask for more than that .
positive	if the delivery goes well i will always look to use this service in the future .
neutral	awaiting reply from office .
positive	good , attractive alternative to plastic_bags for my craft items .
positive	very quick and excellent value
negative	they delivered a double .
positive	i received my items extremely quickly .
negative	i '_m amazed_at how many people they get in this park , so it must make financial sense to them to operate like this .
negative	about fast delivery .
neutral	that was the good part .
positive	i find you dont get this with other insurance .
positive	a really friendly company that dealt_with an issue i had with speed and efficiency .
negative	0 rd delivery date to replace faulty items was arranged using another annual_leave date .
positive	they deliver a competitive , discreet and reliable service with speed and professionalism .
neutral	!
neutral	but i hope they will keep_up with their good work though .
negative	they say their website made me aware of this but i didn_'_t read as was in a hurry to book and didn_'_t think_twice that insurance wouldn_'_t cover damage , after all , there '_s only 0 things you want to be covered for - loss and damage .
negative	ordered correct sized shoes and when arrived box stated size ordered .
negative	i '_ve checked it and the only one that advises to be turned off when travelling is the data roaming as it specvifically states on the iphone that it incurs costs abroad .
neutral	i specified to leave my parcel by the back door but as this was not on the parcel , the post_office refused to do this and i had to make a 0 mile_round_trip and pay for parking to collect my items .
neutral	only use if i cannot buy from a shop and deliver as i feel the quality is inferior .
neutral	watch out for the sharp_edges when assembling - i received a 0 cm cut from a sharp edge on the base whilst simply tightening the bolts .
negative	might be cheap but in the long run they have cost me a fortune in having to replace the goods again for my ciustomer .
positive	it is excellent quality and looks fantastic .
negative	i was told that as the pans were coming directly from the supplier that they would have to contact them .
positive	i found debbie to be not only exteremley helpful whilst dealing_with my enquiry and she was extremely friendly which was nice .
positive	there was a delay in the tyres reaching the depot but i was advised well before my booked slot and in fact they were fitted only one hour later .
negative	also they would not confirm that the same thing would not happen the next_day .
neutral	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
positive	many_thanks and i will_definitely recommend and use you again .
neutral	i would use furniture @ work again and recommend them to friends but i would also recommend they carefully check the packaging and do not accept it if it '_s damaged .
positive	the website is easy to use - the only down_side is that a bigger variety of pictures of certain people would be very much_appreciated .
neutral	i feel they could '_ve been more on the ball and identified this much sooner saving me a week without a much needed headset which i '_ve sourced elsewhere .
neutral	i arrived to see if they could help and even_though they were very busy , the owner had a look at the damaged locking_nut and the damaged tool and said he thought he could get it off with just his normal air impact_wrench gun . he removed all other three first and then got the broken one off in a matter of seconds .
negative	not the outer_hebrides .
positive	loved the presentation that a gift box provides .
neutral	as the order was urgent i had to order this item from elsewhere , the refund from proswimwear was dealt_with quickly .
neutral	service was very good - 0 day delivery .
negative	i told them this was not good enough as the prices of the flight had already gone up £_00 .
positive	although i am sure that people have had troubles and shortcomings with different sites and different companies for whatever_reason , as a first - time buyer i do not have any of these prior ideas that taint my mind .
positive	item bought very quick delivery , thank_you !!
neutral	the recipient noticed the van leaving and found the flowers at the front .
negative	it takes 0 days for the uk custom to clear it .
neutral	missed my departure as a result .
negative	clearly the order will never arrive and i will complain to the oft so that they can eventually shut these_cowboys down .
positive	excellent service
neutral	large orders are often delayed by a tiny part with no warning which i find frustrating .
neutral	i said i didn_'_t want an upgrade , i paid a lot for same day delivery and i would like that cost refunding instead .
negative	i wish i hadn_'_t gone to 0 and probably was too hasty in my plans but hindsight is a wonderful thing !
negative	do they not ever open their mail then ???
negative	sadly a pretty_useless company .
negative	i was so angry i have to admit i sent quite a rude email , but i was so fed_up of being_messed about by this company previously and had spent a lot of money - i wanted the service which was paid for . they got back to me and said the address was incomplete - well it wasn_'_t when zaggora confirmed my order so im pretty sure it was hermes ' cock up again . the company had to send a whole new order out - which i did receive within 0_days . so was 0_weeks before i received a delivery which was suppose to be a max of 0 working_days !
neutral	the part did not arrive for another 0 days !
positive	to all my friends and family .
neutral	after paying €_000 . 00 i felt the check out time was too early and that some additional accomodation should have been provided especially as we had to wait a day for a plumber to deal with a problem within the house .
positive	i received my print within 0_days and it '_s a very professional picture .
negative	so very upset as these were for mother '_s day as i live across the world .
neutral	the day before i got a phone_call to say that the bed was out of stock and would be in within 0 - 00 days .
positive	i have used lenstore for a few_years_now and i remain happy with the service they supply .
positive	service superb , goods arrived much_faster_than_expected .
negative	i have bought several items from wowcher and will never buy from them again after this utter_rubbish customer experience !
positive	fantastic price and very rapid delivery despite_being during the christmas holidays .
neutral	i never like puzzles that don_'_t hold apart at the edges .
neutral	however what i didn_'_t know when placing my order was they ' d cut_corners when choosing a delivery company and instead of hiring a reputable firm , went with yodel .
positive	as it was my first order , they informed me that my item was going to be delivered to my billing_address rather then my shipping address .
positive	excellent
negative	i checked after 0 and it informed me parcel has_been scanned and is on its way to the delivery depot .
positive	i will_definitely use again !
neutral	the ankle_support could have gone in a strong a0 envelope but it came in a box which from memory was about 0 inches by 0 inches , stuffed full of paper with the tiny support bandage taking up about quarter of an inch in the bottom .
negative	when i tried to tell her this she simply ignored me or did not udnerstand me and told me i would get a confirmation_email soon .
positive	i ordered a velux_blackout_blind .
negative	i ordered a scooter for my daughter '_s christmas_present last monday with fast 0 - 0 day delivery .
neutral	i got a few frantic calls because they had read the 0th_may as the 0th_march and thought i wanted to come in the day i had booked on the day
positive	service always good and items always in stock .
positive	excellent , friendly service from simply colours and the cost wasn_'_t bad at all .
neutral	i could only use parts of the outfit but i ordered it at such short_notice i could not return it .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for better service .
neutral	we were unaware that the parcel had been delivered to the neighbour as the courier left no card to indicate this .
neutral	now it is only sold in 000 gm packets .
positive	great idea for reviews in one area , like minded people giving honest real opinions
neutral	however , its a shame they may lose customers due to a poor courier service experience such as mine .
neutral	had no idea when it was arriving or whether it had been dispatched because the tracking email didn_'_t get sent to me until the morning after it was delivered !!!
neutral	my order was triplicated .
negative	was looking for an oak coffee_table and oak_nest of tables .
negative	not what was promised by iflorist !
negative	trusting the sales_pitch on the eflorist website i placed an order for next_day delivery for my sister - in - laws_birthday .
negative	the tv arrived 0 days_later , which was good , however i noticed that the tv had been shipped from france , which seemed odd .
negative	upon further_discussion he agreed to phone my local kwik_fit ( which i would to drive too !)
negative	i did say to the stressfreeparking guy that the car_park concerned should be removed from their site .
negative	i ordered a goodmans digital recorder that when it finally came i found that the remote did not work ( i tried a friends remote and found that it worked with that one ) and when i contacted the company they said that it was up to mighty_deals to sort and mighty_deals are just ignoring me .
neutral	in the end it was all good because i received some better pairs of skiies at the same price .
neutral	thankfully , i haven_'_t had any situations like that , either as a buyer or a seller , so i '_m not sure how paypal would deal with a situation like that .
positive	very happy with the service .
neutral	i googled caa easa atpl licence cover and i ordered the item on the page shown in my web_browser .
positive	received money within a couple of days .
positive	it is a great , fast , service .
neutral	what was more annoying still was that there were people at calais booking the journey with dfds so i cannot understand the problem .
negative	third time spoke to someone_who couldn_'_t really care , said it was the carrier '_s fault not theirs , and said she would process a refund for goods but nothing for telephone_calls unless i sent a statement .
positive	i sent back the faulty tyre on the monday after my ride and received a replacement in the post by thursday
positive	no_probs at all - recommended a +++
positive	once again i have had a very quick , easy and well priced transaction with cjs_cd_keys .
positive	i would definitely use mazuma again .
negative	very dissapointing with my first order . very poor quality of the print . i '_ll never use optimalprint again !
negative	i am_appalled by this and was not only irate when she called to tell me , but embarrassed and humiliated also .
positive	first tempted by the price , having been told by the high_street_opticians the ridiculous prices they charge , so i thought i had nothing to lose .
positive	the product ( la palma bar_stools ) were fantastic too !
negative	definitely won_'_t be using this website again .
positive	kind_regards ,
neutral	however deliver was awful , i had requested leave with a neighbour if no answer but the flowers were left_outside the front of the premises where they were all night because the recipient had been home all the time .
negative	my vodaphone contract and service is pretty_much golden in colour , whereas o0 and the lovely telefonica are a rather unpleasant brown !
neutral	the rental company was away from the airport and we had to telephone them to come to collect us .
neutral	but all in all a good service
positive	empty bottles
negative	i asked for an_email to be sent to me confirming that the order had been cancelled and to date nothing has ever came through .
positive	ordered them online following my prescription ; and got a very nice looking pair for only £_00 .
negative	other_companies do an equally good job .
negative	wrong order and no customer service .
neutral	i would certainly recommend the site to others interested in such a look for their equipment , but just be aware of the slight non - conforming fit .
negative	0 .
neutral	the service was good but the item was not at all like the photo on the website !
negative	the childrens ' party did not live up to the description on the website - no dedicated party host , no cosmic bowling with flashing_lights and no dancing with the party host .
positive	each item was well boxed and protected .
neutral	may revert to p_& o dover - calais next time , and put up with the extra miles on the french side .
positive	delivery was quick , packaging was good , product was enjoyed !
neutral	disappointed sadly , rather a shame .
positive	it was extremely well_wrapped up with all sealed wrappers around product so i knew it was genuine .
negative	i ordered the item just under a week_ago , the money has left my bank_account and still the item has not arrived despite the website saying it will take 0 - 0_days .
positive	this was the third order i ' d placed and it was the the third order that had arrived on time .
positive	from showroom to delivery service was superb .
neutral	then when you call pet_supermarket to complain you have to wait around 00 - 00_mins to get through .
neutral	somebody was desperate to get a virtual ingredient to make a virtual cocktail in order to get a virtual - bartenders ' certificate .
negative	!
negative	. 00 / 0 / 00 .
positive	it '_s very straight_forward and i found the prices very fair .
positive	the speed at which this was delivered and the tracking_system was the best i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	i was charged_£_00 cancellation costs , even_though it was weeks before the booking .
negative	they do not handel parcels with care , i have received parcels with foot prints on , and i have whitnessed the couriers throwing items about in the back of vehicles .
neutral	after my berlin trip in feb i expected to get my nectar_points within 00 days .
neutral	was promised on another delivery to follow .
positive	it is a very fast and efficient delivery service .
neutral	i know that i will recommend products , but i fear that the price will be an obstacle to regular purchases .
negative	i am_currently_awaiting a reply
neutral	however , my big_disappointment was how the new breakage was dealt_with - very automated , with not an_apology anywhere , actually the whole_thing was highly inconvenient - i was without specs for a week , had to pack them up and send them back etc etc , only a few_weeks after i had bought them ,
positive	they kept me up to date on my case and provided an excellent service .
neutral	good products though .
positive	very helpful and a great service .
negative	no confidence in this company .
negative	i told them to leave it as i didn_'_t have time to wait .
positive	!
positive	never been able to order by the foot before , brilliant idea .
negative	wonder_if the company still the , original one ?
neutral	two or three of the prints are very grainy and appear to be very red , not sure if this is because the software automatically sizes the pictures and difficult to see on laptop when creating book as you are not allowed to view the book at actual size .
positive	bit_sceptical as i heard a few bad_reviews about these type of companies but i am happy to say the transaction went very smoothly and exactly as advertised on the website
negative	it was received on 00 . 00 . 00 .
positive	quick and efficient .
neutral	my only issue is with the colour .
negative	liverpool victoria was number 0 on the list in which , i contacted them and i got it for £ 0 . 00p cheaper_than esure and it includes hire car and legal cost at no extra_cost !
neutral	how do i return item for refund as not understanding return form , do i have to give bank details , do i have to pay for postage ,
negative	the first time they said they were arranging for another supplier to provide the product because they didn_'_t have it in stock .
neutral	i then received an_email from envirofone saying gheir quote for the 0nd phone was about to expire !!
neutral	i did as instructions said and checked the list to find out that a few pieces were missing , so phoned mattress next_day who were very helpful but said that parts have to come from manufacturers and im still_waiting , almost a week_later .
negative	the 0 to 0 day delivery never happened !
negative	i foolishly purchased online without reviewing the policy but presumed they would be in line with their main_competitors .
positive	have tried other online drug companies and although some are a little cheaper because they don_'_t charge any postage they aren_'_t anywhere_near as friendly or helpful .
positive	a well finished pleasing light oak finish , with carefully supported adjustable shelves . it goes beautifully with our new carpet . a faultless bookcase .
positive	delighted with table and sideboard . beautifully made lovely wood . service was excellent . before and after delivery . very polite and helpful staff . i have been recommending to family and friends . anyone that has visited has_commented on the quality and the beauty of the furniture .
positive	the products arrived the next_day .
negative	still no parcel .
positive	i '_ve never found any other hostel booking website to be as efficient , cheap and easy to use as hostelbookers .
positive	my recent_purchase of an electric_chainsaw was a case in point , i needed one for home use but didnt want to commit to spending too much for occasional light use .
neutral	i can see where someone has tried to re - sew the straps on to make it look like they were never torn in the 0st place .
positive	just off to order more !
neutral	it is fair to say the product in every other respect is excellent , shame about the after sales service with a sneer .
positive	fast delivery service , excellent quality .
negative	im still_waiting .
negative	i emailed the company and apart_from an auto_reply ( that i should receive a response within 00_hours ), never_heard from them .
neutral	thanks too .
positive	i did not know this brand ( it '_s not a famous brand in france ) but it seems it '_s a good one for less money than some famous_brands .
positive	capital on tap is amazing , they are a bunch of really helpful people , and what they provide is great .
positive	have fun !
negative	- i had to pay for accommodation in sydney for a night .
negative	i was caught off guard by the cold caller who offered a discount on this product for £_00 , only if i paid there and then by credit_card over the phone .
negative	we found it to be unacceptable and wrote an_email asking about delivery date and compensation for such a long delay ( it has_been a month ).
positive	would definitely recommend and order from them again , not expensive , super_fast delivery & lovely quality products .
neutral	have phoned cheap_smells and they said rest of order is on way but heavier items are sent differently ?!
negative	i contacted customer_services and haven_'_t had a reply .
positive	i purchased the torch and it arrived just a couple of days_later .
neutral	cant_knock the service , but the usn igf0 protein is terrible to mix , bought for the first and last time .
neutral	why do they allow people to arrive late into the films ?
neutral	now i wasted my money on express delivery .
positive	easy to select from a great selection of frames and input information was easy to do .
positive	!
neutral	the only thing is that it went from birmingham to leeds , back to birmingham , and then back to leeds .
negative	not enough flooring , no beading etc_etc .
neutral	when i went to collect vehicle and have quick demo on how to connect and disconnect removable bar , it did not locate properly , so adjustments were then made on the roadside , clearly this had not been checked during fitting and i could have had a wasted_journey to return the vehicle had i taken this on trust .
positive	( order ref .
neutral	the message i wrote online was not written in the card , so my girlfriend received a blank card thrown in the bottom of the box with the flowers 😠
negative	me : " well clearly they haven_'_t bothered to today when it was supposed to arrive .
positive	service was super costume delivered next_day .
neutral	i tend to use ebid and declampe more often now .
negative	they really don_'_t care and the people you speak are robots who have zero ability to get things done .
neutral	not sure if courier was at fault .
negative	was not offered any compensation / apologies .
negative	a clone of pc_world website . and only has same costing as store .
neutral	i am undecided as to whether i would use this service again despite the reasonable_price .
negative	i have ordered from serenata on previous_occasions and have always been very pleased with the flowers delivered , but i am very disappointed with the ocean whisper that i ordered for my mother at a cost of £_00 . 00 they were a very poor bunch of flowers and although i do not expect them to look exactly like the description i do expect there to be some similarity .
positive	would highly_reccomend .
neutral	not sure if i would use them again
positive	carrier_bag shop supply good quality plastic_bags in a good range of sizes .
neutral	the swing frame arrived in a timely_manner , without the quadpod .
negative	it '_s crap , but it '_s cheap .
positive	they have a vast_choice of product to suit all_budgets .
negative	the thing that has made me even more angry is that i was supposed to receive an_email from them with the revised_offer of £_000 which i never received so i did not have the opportunity to decline their offer and get my phone back .
negative	c ' etait clair que_la boite a était deja ouvri et que_la boite a était déchiré en ouverture .
negative	delivery from the company ebeez was delayed so i contacted them , i later only received 0 vacuum_cleaner .
negative	then again it '_s no surprise that with such a crappy service .
neutral	however , on this occasion i was a little disappointed , i ordered a christmas arrangement to be sent to a friend who had just had a heart_attack , paying £_00 . 00 , and seeing online thought it would be a reasonable size .
neutral	i was informed that a new order would be raised but would take another week .
negative	don_'_t be tempted_by their cheap deals they don_'_t exist and are lies !
negative	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
negative	why send a delivery window if your going to be early ?
positive	very impressive packaging as well .
positive	i think there needs to be more originations set_up like this one .
neutral	she received on time and was happy .
positive	have used this site several_times to buy clutch pencils / lead holders .
positive	i '_ll always go to this company first in future for my woll
negative	i wanted to use this service only for streaming online !
positive	after visiting the showroom last_year we had decided which one we wanted to buy .
neutral	blue_chip arranged for a parking place to be made available and an_apology recieved .
neutral	when two of the items were off loaded they were found with damaged packages , so marks were informed .
neutral	unfortunately both my friend and i were disappointed by the quality of flowers as they turned_up half_dead and floppy .
negative	lens not arrived and no communication to advise of tracking
negative	offer a refund but i cant get to the post_office to return the item within the required time due to having a c - section .
neutral	!
negative	but as of today no money has_been refunded .
positive	thank_you serenata for everything , i will most definitely be using you again .
negative	i can not find anything in the refund policy on the web that states that they do not refund items that they consider to be underwear .
negative	freezing_cold room .
neutral	excellent trainers and good pass rate , let_down by poor communication and administration .
neutral	the selection of bikes and accessories are second to none .
negative	you '_ve got my money i '_ve got no product .
neutral	only_downside is that tesco is often frustratingly out of things i want to buy - sometimes very ordinary things !
neutral	but on this occasion would have been cheaper , with no time penalty .
negative	royal_mail is getting expensive now but they have never_let_me down ever ,
negative	i have order 0 jackets and after 0 days they sent me an email that they dont have the order and they are sorry ok no problem but . my transaction was pending so i said no warys it will come_back . wrong they took the money from my account and surprise i have tried to get in touch for over 0 week send email with no answer from them and then i have found the email of their ceo and told_him what is happing and surprise next_day email from them then after 0 week my money were back i will not recomend them
negative	now they have to cancel it ( it takes 00_hours ) before they can resubmit it for a new order .
positive	once i got the email_saying the order had shipped i expected it to be about three_days before it arrived but it was waiting for me when i got home the same day .

negative	lots of hidden_fees , 00_% final value 00p here 00p there paypal .
positive	i always get good value for money and free delivery from pet_supermarket , its great .
negative	i have always suspected jiggerypookery in our lottery since they refused to let richard branson take over and give more to players and charity . i hope i live long enough to see the sh ** hit the fan and those who are ripping_off the money brought to book
neutral	the furniture is great .
neutral	however , most companies are great at taking you money .
negative	we were worried that our car would be damaged and that we would probably miss our flight so we went to the official parking and paid £_00 .
negative	one thing though is certain - i will never book with them again .
neutral	the box was broken and crushed with the product half falling out .
positive	0 minute payment procedure .
negative	bought from them - within 0 hour had a few phone_calls and an_email asking thm if they can do anything etc - impression you got was that they would be faultless .
positive	personal and efficient service - excellent quality product - arrived on the day it was promised .
neutral	can '_t see the functionality to store favourites , card_details , etc_., which would be good for repeat_orders .
neutral	initially , the wrong_size was sent .

negative	was told it would be painless , that they would do all the work .
positive	thank_you so much .
negative	do not use them under any circumstances as i promise you you '_ll be disappointed .
positive	i would highly_recommend ' mytuxedo . co . uk '.
negative	they advised this was impossible and switched me to paying by cheque ( same date ) instead .
negative	i '_ve still got about 00 months on my contract with them , but i '_m more than tempted to fork_out how ever many hundreds of pounds it '_ll cost to be rid of them for good .
negative	so i have made 0 complaints via phone and internet chat and now an_email .
negative	?
negative	i cannot fathom how long it takes these useless numpties to put 0 tickets in an envelope with my name and address on ?
negative	i wouldn_'_t buy from this company again .

neutral	i used to go sainsburys but everything is so expensive compared to asda or tesco .
neutral	disappointing .

neutral	would like to have known that at the start .
negative	i have had positive_experiences with wowcher in the past .
negative	" as soon as possible " the lady said - and that is all she could tell me .
negative	i am a property landlord and ordered a £_000 t . v bed for 0 of my homes waited 0_days still not arrived caused total inconvenience delivery driver a liar said he called and no body home !
positive	our production units will be using these magnets .
neutral	the website is very inviting and professional .
neutral	loved the choice & quality of items .
positive	the website was very user - friendly and offered a wide_range of options .
neutral	this caused me extra work as i had to scrape every tile before putting on wall .
negative	really really disappointed with the service .
neutral	ordered a shower redring active 000s 0 kw which is still shown on the fastlec web_site but was sent a different model redring active a0 0kw .
positive	would definitely use this company again .
negative	i would not recommend this company to anybody and would strongly_recommend that you shop around and find a more trustworthy supplier who actually has a customer service department should anything go_wrong .
negative	!
positive	worth the time spent doing it ourselves and would use them again .
positive	the panels are fairly large 0000 by 0000 and really need two people to fit .
negative	they took - stole ?
negative	absolutely atrocious !
negative	i notified customer_services and because they are so awfully inflexible , i was told that i had to wait_until the parcel had been missing for 00 working_days before anybody was prepared to help me .
negative	and i now have to pick it up from their service centre .
negative	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
negative	rentalcars . com never mentioned this .
positive	really easy would recommend !
negative	if i could give them zero_stars i would .
negative	!
positive	have booked with fhr before and will definitely use again .
negative	very good i got my order the next_day .
negative	i was then told that the money had already been collected , and would be returned to my account within 0 to 0 working_days .
positive	very pleased and will be looking here in the future !
positive	service was good and your engineer ( lee0 was very good .
positive	i also love the length of the handles .
negative	won_'_t be recommending anyone again
negative	never approach this estate_agent i have contacted the police and watchdog .
neutral	i have been assured by him that the reason the collection failed was because fedex failed to fully record and pass on to its staff my collection address .
positive	however , mine was about 0 . 0kohms therefore this would indicate that it was ok .
neutral	i was told i would have to pay for the item to be sent back unless i wanted to come into the store , but before 0pm .
neutral	the cabins and ship was nice .
neutral	to cut the story_short , took workshop express advice on shape / size and agreed 0mm overhang .
neutral	i think the service is good but the constant harrasment on the phone to the guarentor is the reason we proberbly won_'_t use you again .
positive	well_done , as ever .
positive	i placed my order one day and it arrived the following_day .
neutral	i use dfds newhaven dieppe because it '_s a good route for my destination in brittany , but there are times it is so expensive that i make alternative travel_plans . the worst thing is that i have friends who work on the ships and say they have the spare capacity . so by being too pricy i know they loose clients . wish they would have a clearer frequent_traveller set_up . at present if you join the frequent_traveller scheme it '_s a lotttery as to if you can get on . it '_s getting to the stage where with friends we are thinking of keeping a spare / or hire car in dieppe and just go over as foot passengers .
neutral	the cushion as a gift was a lovely idea but unfortunately it was not obvious from the computer_screen that the meaningful verse i had added should have been on the white shirt as it is not possible to read with the black_background .
negative	i booked through booking . com because it worked out £ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .
positive	i had never bought a game online like this before and was unsure if it was a good idea , i thought maybe i should just go into_town and buy it from a shop like the good old days .
neutral	initial estimate of £_00 seemed very good indeed compared to other 0rd_party companies , however i then received an email to say that it had ' less_than 0 scratches on the front ' and decreased the value to £_00 . 00 , although still a fair price i accepted , but i know for a sure that the equipment was in pristine_condition when it left , so i would like to know where the ' scratches ' appeared from .
positive	there are no_catches with them .
positive	both our cats took to the carry baskets like a bed and now sleep in them .
negative	if they have such a poor customer service record why do any companies use them ?????
positive	even_though we have used amigo_autos for years we still check out other_companies to ensure we are getting a good deal .
neutral	unfortunately , as i am not a plumber , i bought a slim line shower_tray ( i think they look much_nicer_than the other ones ) i didn_'_t know that i would also need to buy a kit that included the legs .

neutral	however i feel the company who delivered the products could be letting you down .
neutral	my parcel arrived after 00_hours . excellent delivery but the tracking said it was still in the wharehouse in tamworth . i wasted a lot of time on the phone and online . a manager rang to apologise for losing my parcel 00_hours after delivery and i signed for it on the drivers scanner .

neutral	i usually use a rival string company but decided to try string direct because of the competitive_prices , however i received the wrong set of strings which arrived on time but meant i had to do my session with old strings until the right ones arrived 0 days_later .

neutral	have still received nothing .

positive	their service is impeccable and , so far , the deliveries have arrived before the promised date .
positive	trust product 000_% - have certainly seen an improvement in my 00 year_old horse and tell others when then they remark on his youthfulness .
negative	next_day i tracked the parcel online , the parcel was at the local wrexham service centre ( yodel ),
negative	firstly , speed checker on talk_talk '_s website provided an absurdly optimistic speed estimate for my area ( hither green , london ) presumably due to a software error .
negative	i post 000 parcels a week if yodel were a football_team they would lose 000 - 0 ever week mostly from own goals , and their manager would be sacked .

neutral	i would use this company again , they have a very large choice of products , delivery was fast , well_packaged and discreet .
neutral	the owner mark went out of his way to put my money in the bank within an_hour of him learning of my problem , i have revised my original review to reflect the good handling albeit late of the person in charge ,

negative	we have had yodel deliver to us on many occassions without a problem so why was this so difficult ???
positive	why dont you go to ao . com you will get it next_day and they call you to let you know where they are .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for more !
negative	i gave them my paypal details but nothing was credited .
neutral	lite hjalp det å skrive til_kundeservice å spørre .

neutral	on wednesday was phoned to arrange delivery on friday !
neutral	salt consumption is at_least double what was advised , hence running costs are double .
negative	i am also passing my complaint to tradingstandards , i advise anyone_else who has had problems to do the same .
negative	.
negative	i was recommended to switch tariffs to save money . and then was charged_£_000 for the set_up of it - their error they said , but they took the funds out of my account without my knowledge anyway , then to get it back was a nightmare !!!
neutral	on 0 separate_occasions the website fell over so despite trying for over 00_minutes each time we gave up and ordered from eat .
neutral	unfortunately , i purchased a large ( being a medium to large build ) and the costume was small to medium at best .
neutral	because i was busy and in a rush i mistakenly booked a 0 . 00am crossing from dunkerque instead of a 0 . 00pm crossing .

neutral	i was not best pleased with this service .

negative	absolutely terrible service .
positive	quoits is a simple game but provides hours of fun for all ages .
negative	now my vision is slowly getting worse and the aftercare lifetime_guarantee stands for nothing as ultralase has_gone in to administration strangely starting back up as ultralase clinics ltd . what a scam please stay_away .
neutral	it was a manufacturing_fault , so not tap outlets fault , however that is why 0_stars instead of 0 .
positive	i will certainly be spreading the word over in jersey and i am already sharing their facebook_page .
negative	will never use again totally wrong how a company is run like this .
neutral	it was exactly as_described and delivered very quickly and efficiently .
neutral	i received the alarms then told by the electrician i needed something to secure them to .
negative	i will pursue this further with trading_standards we just want what we paid for or some other solution . be very careful if you are considering purchases from this site , they need to change their claimed 0 reasons to buy to 0 and add customer service .
negative	i understand that this is a busy_period but not being_able to speak to anyone on a call or have a reply to my email is very poor customer service .
positive	made sure that they worked (!
neutral	i was told by just_kampers that there was noting wrong with the rubbers i had sent back , but find it hard to believe that just_kampers have attempted to fit the rubbers to experience the difficulty in fitting them .

negative	the tickets arrived on sheets of a0 paper , with someone '_s name and address crossed out in the top left hand corner .
negative	guess_what no delivery in that time_slot . drive couldn_'_t find the address .
negative	this column is empty .
negative	nothing was said at this stage about additional_costs .
positive	kept me informed when my parcel was delivered great service .
negative	i therefore contacted pet_supermarket by email in the 0nd week of january .
neutral	meine_mutter hatte sich trotzdem gefreut aber ich frag mich warum wir die wahl zwischen vielen verschieden blumenstraeussen bekommen wenn die dann nicht so aussehen wie bestellt .
neutral	both_times i ordered 0 . 0 kilo sensitive dog_food she has had 0 for a dog and one for a cat .
neutral	which meant i would be back at work and unable to receive delivery .
neutral	first time using this site so i was wary about giving personal details and booking online .
negative	an_hour and a half later i got a phone_call from the subcontracting company saying he had been sent by talktalk to an address in carlisle !
neutral	i understand it was my choice to sell the items but in honesty i couldn_'_t be bothered to sell the items individually but it worked out to £ 0 . 00 a cd roughly . you know they '_ll be sold on for minimum of £ 0 . 00 each , great business .
negative	refreezing food is dangerous .
negative	same as the last reviewer .
negative	you are going to pay at_least £_00 / month more due to calling these numbers .
neutral	although the order was delivered exactly on time , my colleague received a bouquet of red_roses - not really what i wanted .

neutral	i have since emailed litecraft and had a refund of the cost of delivery .
neutral	the ' adjustable feet ' have a range of about 0cm ( not mentioned in the description ), perhaps useful for stopping a wobble on an uneven wooden_floor but useless for leveling a table on a sloping campsite , which is what i wanted .
neutral	sent back using buyaparcels courier collection , waited another week while the incorrect unit was checked before the correct item was dispatched .
positive	would use the site again no_problems at all .
neutral	disappointing as reviews i read sounded very good and great value product .
positive	but thank_you for putting bread back on my plate
negative	in order that i could buy the product i needed from a retailer who actually held stock , i requested a refund but my e_- mail was ignored .
neutral	the delivery company ups had " attempted " delivery several_times but could not find the road , they never contacted me to clarify how to find it so if i hadn_'_t contacted nightgear i wouldn_'_t have received it on time !
neutral	as for paying for fastrack through security - worth_every_penny - especially if travelling with young_children !
negative	i sincerely say to future customers , don_'_t use them and go to a competitor who will offer a service and a quality product !
neutral	over all was okay .
neutral	00_mins of scoffing .
negative	i have now emailed them to cancel the order , as i '_m not confident whether this is even a genuine retailer .
negative	it is shocking that companies such as this are entirely unaccountable to the general_public .
positive	easy to use and quick .
neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
neutral	0 .

negative	parcelfarce / fedex useless !!!
neutral	asked driver twice which bus we needed and told wrong one both_times . luckily other persons on bus gestured to us to get on correct bus .
neutral	also took a bit of time to arrive as they use couriers instead of postal service , which would have been quicker .
positive	good price and quality and fast delivery what more can i say thanks guys a +++++
positive	i really enjoy buying from blackcircles .
neutral	sent for these water_saving devices thinking i was doing my bit for saving the planet . starting with the 0 minute shower saver , which is just an egg timer and does not really cut it because ie , if you wash your hair in the shower it doesn_'_t give you enough time for rinsing and condition unless you stop the water in between which means you could end up scalded or worse . needs to be 0 minutes . the drop flush save is just confusing , nowhere on the website does it say can '_t be used with push_button toilets yet when received diagram only shows handle flush toilets , so i '_m confused .
negative	this company is a joke , i don_'_t expect to waiting at home all day in case they send it back to the depot station , also the customer service is non_existent .
positive	no one else out there was even willing to try to hit our deadline and it was a pleasure_doing_business with usb0u .

positive	the shelves add to the girls ' personal space and are a great asset .
neutral	the whisky was for father '_s day for my father - in - law .
neutral	one operative left more damage than when he started , i . e .
negative	i called numerous_times but no returned phone_calls etc .
positive	as i live fairly local to the shop i find it convenient to call i call in and have found their advice has_been first_class .
neutral	sadly i no_longer feel able to order from viovet .
negative	the other large item i bought was one of the most expensive wcs as all the cheaper ones were out of stock and i needed it urgently .
negative	when returning the psycho ward outfit , we didn_'_t get any postage back , just the amount of the outfit so i ' d say this is an unsatisfactory returns_policy for such a large online company .
neutral	but flowers limp !
neutral	delivery came on two_separate days , which was a bit of a pain , and i had to contact them in order to find out when second delivery was on its way .
negative	if he had left me a note telling_me to look around the back , i would have been slightly_annoyed but happy that i had my £_000 motherboard and i may not have realized that my signature had been forged .
neutral	some illegible writing was on the window but no other indication that it was unfit for use .
negative	so now we have to refuse the delivery and attempt to get our money back from this incompetent organistion .
positive	the tickets arrived in just a few_days .
positive	good to have a whole year for a moderate price and knowing that you won_'_t be involved in excess costs if you are involved in an accident abroad .
negative	the customer service department is unhelpful , inept and incompetent and i would not recommend this company to anyone .

positive	that aside .
negative	half the tv in the seats didnt work , no vegan option for food , a 00 hour flight with no food . come on . it dont take much to cater for veggies and vegans these days
negative	i cannot_believe the positive_feedback on here for this site .
neutral	it also stated on the receipt 00 x 00g but there were only 0 x 00g in the box which was a bit_disappointing .
neutral	it would have been cheaper for me to buy local and collect same day as the saving was less_than the hire cost .
neutral	we were quite excited when ilumi appeared as it seemed that they had so many positive things to offer .
positive	ordered it on the spot and arrived the next_day !
negative	0 dys later , no confirmation of refund , customers services say its not instant and can '_t tell me when it will be done
positive	i ordered it on wednesday_night and it was delivered friday_morning .
positive	simple and effective .
neutral	didn_'_t risk paying full price of around £_00 , for fear of not getting the refund at a later date .

neutral	fast delivery .
negative	but i did not get an answer to my complaint .
neutral	it was the total_opposite with the pick_up , i was 00_minutes early and called the contact number and informed them and somehow he booked another cab ?
negative	no one at three will care because i '_ve paid already !
positive	for the past 0 months i have been looking for the perfect ring .
negative	i discover that in his panic to dispatch this payment to the organisation he forgot to include the
positive	the theme was 00s to present day and their selection of party_themes was exactly_what i was looking for and very reasonably_priced to .
neutral	and no . to be honest no change in first week , all in all . pretty poo !!

positive	i was very pleased with the service provided by end .
neutral	i was massively impressed when the order arrived next_day and was all there .
neutral	on a couple of occasions , i have thought that i had earned cashback , having fulfilled all the criteria for the particular offer .
positive	cannot_fault the service i recieved .
negative	if i owed them money they would soon be on my back for it !
positive	the item came exactly when expected and was very well_packaged .
neutral	it is in fact vitamins & minerals split into 0 capsules , so 00 days supply !

neutral	electric_fire was delivered very quickly and returned in about 0_days ( due to week - end ) but it was three_weeks and an_email before my money was refunded .
neutral	i was told i could send it back and once they received it , they would send out the green & white .
neutral	i had to pick it up as i wasn_'_t in when they delivered - hardest_thing ever !

negative	delivery finally on monday midday , which we rejected as obviously not needed .
negative	i ordered a mattress 0_weeks before my due date as i found my original one didn_'_t fit properly .
negative	if this is not an underhanded marketing_ploy to increase revenue then they need to upgrade their e_- commerce system to fully display ( and charge ) all costs to the customer before charging .

positive	just a few_clicks of a buttons and bam , i '_ve got the code .
positive	i was given an immediate_refund of the difference in price between the two tents .

negative	!
positive	have used this product for some time and it definitely helps my dog '_s arthritis .
neutral	the website '_s great to browse and when going to the store in person there are usually a few people around who know their stuff .
neutral	would have been better to know that you use a ' signature_required ' mail delivery before the order is placed ( apologies if i missed that !).
positive	they even went out of their way to cook extra chips , which had gone down a huge_success !
neutral	when i received the outfits , i tried mine on straight_away , it fitted really well and was just as_described , only to find out when i took it off the stitching had come away from the skirt and top bit of the outfit , i hadn_'_t got enough time to return it so i have ended_up stitching it back together myself in order to wear it .
neutral	shame i had to chase .!

negative	avoid !!
negative	it looks a fantastic proffesional site .
negative	terrible communication .
negative	if not , why not .
neutral	the approach by the company to open state here that my experience included " a lie " is unacceptable and defamatory particularly given it hadn_'_t provided any facts about having received the goods prior to the request for my feedback .
neutral	with excellent quality food on offer , why oh why don_'_t sainsburys provide enough staff at their checkouts ?
neutral	would have preferred to have this pointed_out initially .

neutral	it did come off with cleaning though .
neutral	i carreid on & then got an_email_confirmation saying delivery would be 0 - 0_days_later .

negative	avoid if you want to get on with your life !
neutral	old review : if you are buying goods from an online_retailer , always check if they use yodel as the courier - if they do - buy the good elsewhere .
negative	so it all turned_out ok in the end , but i had to be pretty tough with them to make them play ball , and i expect most people would just allow themselves to be stitched up with unfair and completely unjustified fees .
neutral	?
negative	offered no compensation , said he would inform the store and that was it !
neutral	on arrival at our hotel we did not see our thomas_cook rep for a welcome meeting as they were unavailable but we did see a stand in rep . that was the only time we saw any thomas_cook rep which appeared to be a standing joke amongst other guests at the hotel .

positive	excellent service , i will_definately return again .
neutral	overall good , but not the best experience in the world .

negative	i havd tried to call them several_times on saturday_morning ( as i have today at 0 . 00pm ) but simply get a constant unanswered ringing .
neutral	unfortunately most of the flowers either did not last more than a couple of days or failed to fully open before wilting .
negative	now think whether i will have something here to order !
negative	the printer cupboard should have 0 sliding shelves as stated on their design diagram , it has none .
negative	after 00_mins of waiting still nobody has answered . not very ' live '.

neutral	however all that aside , i would still use createabadge again .
negative	always had problems with my signal on talk_talk internet was very disappointed with this as i had to phone nearly twice a week and found nothing was ever done to help the situation .
neutral	so assuming that they would get my order monday_morning i should recieve my monitor on tuesday before 0 00 , i waited all day . for nothing , i sent an email via amazon to pcbuyit asking about the situation on tuesday , saturday now , no response , how ever i did get an email asking me to review them .
positive	absolutely perfect .
positive	the subject says it all - the process was incredibly easy , the price seemed fair and the money was in my account on the same day that they received the mobile telephone .
neutral	i ordered leggings and a hat and was really pleased with the speed of delivery and being kept_informed of process of order .
positive	superb customer service
neutral	these stages could be shown along a progress line .

negative	having been a good customer for christmas and birthday cards i am very disappointed by this shoddy service .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	asked if this is correct level of vehicle , told yes .
negative	apparently they were delivered 0_days_later by which point , was too late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
positive	the product was delivered very quickly
neutral	however the delivery service was very poor i have a fairly narrow pathway up to my backdoor which i am convinced the driver could have managed to manoeuver along but instead he left the pallet of tiles in my front_garden .
positive	supplement_warehouse has great prices and a quality selection , they will match prices on anything and give you an extra discount .
neutral	at_least they phoned to let_me know , but then they didn_'_t know there was a florist on their network in the hospital i was ordering for !
positive	bestilte_en cykelcomputer mandag og_havde den tirsdag .
positive	i posted my phone on saturday and i received payment on the monday , very easy to understand and i would definitely use again .
positive	you get the feeling that there is someone in the company who actually reads the e_- mails .
positive	the product arrived quickly and was a good price .
positive	got exactly_what i ordered .
neutral	i could not pull it onto my thigh .
neutral	but no fault to urban_industries just the delivery company .
neutral	with a product for dogs with severe digestive_problems this is worrying .
neutral	i was very disappointed and would not order from this company again !
positive	will send you a copy of the press release too .
positive	i wanted a new bath_panel as my other one was out of guarantee and was damaged .
neutral	i have placed a number of orders with music_magpie ( mm ) recently & here ’_s my experience .
positive	my only_bugbear would be that the carrier was instructed to leave it with a neighbour if we were out , but instead left it by our back door .
positive	sound excellent .
positive	would & have recommended to friends & family .
positive	excellent company would not_hesitate you use them again for future_purchases .
neutral	i would urge the company to review their customer_relations policy as it leaves a lot to be desired and customers need to be confident that their enquiries will be answered in a timely and satisfactory way .
negative	as you are not providing me with any service .
positive	thank_you very much , have used you for 0 years running and would use again .
neutral	i placed an order that was said to be delived the next_day tomorrow came and went no contact from anyone to inform_me as to why my order had not been delivered .
neutral	i received a confirmation_email_confirming this .
positive	needed a low_cost top look as first impression go a long way , was shocked at some of the prices i found , then i found the sign_builder .
negative	i was sure this was a mistake as i read the imei_number directly off my phone anyway
neutral	online they looked a dark_brown however when i got them they are a light brown .
positive	the cheque then arrived the next_day .
positive	excellant company used them a few_times now and would use them again .
negative	when i finally recieved my order the merchandise was faulty ( not fit for purpose ).
negative	absolutely pathetic service .
neutral	the only good thing is the quick delivery .
positive	we can '_t fault the process , it was quick and very straightforward and the contacts are all helpful and friendly .
negative	i ordered a toilet online from this company .
neutral	they couldn_'_t give me the answer without speaking to the supplier so suggested i email with my query and they '_d get back to me .
positive	unfortunately the box was damaged ( 0 " hole in the side ) but the machine was ok . re the machine : love the one stage buttonholer , and it is so much_lighter to handle then my old one - altogether very pleased with my purchase .
positive	so pleased to receive my order so promptly , beautifully_packaged and presented .
positive	i will_definitely use them in future .
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of the same style glasses with different_colour lenses , when i recieved my order one pair was clear lenses and not tinted as i had ordered . i have now returned the faulty pair and m hoping they will manage to supply me with the correct lenses this time . not very impressed . but they were helpful when i phoned .

positive	great
positive	i ordered a bag tidy for my daughter - i received as expected with a lovely personalised thankyou
neutral	i waited in all day and it did not arrive .
positive	excellent and quick service .
neutral	instead i paid the £ 0 . 00 postage to uk then a further £ 0 . 00 to send it to france .
negative	they then took a few_days to reply to my e_- mail about an_alternative .
positive	ordered the 0gb_memory for my desktop_pc running windows 0 and it arrived the next_day .
neutral	paid for fast delivery and took_ages :( but product good
positive	!
positive	found what i wanted easily , payment a doddle , goods arrived 0 days_later .
positive	delivery was excellent and if came a day early .
neutral	although this may not be within the remit , it is information that would have been relevant if a choice of airline was available .
neutral	two hours_later no one phoned i phoned again to be told " we are waiting on the warehouse so i have nothing to tell you " where is the warehouse china no cant be i have had items delivered quicker from america .
negative	get your act_together itv
positive	what '_s not to love .
neutral	extension application tools are very poor quality and look very cheap as if one touch will break them .
neutral	only quibble is that i was told different things by different customer service advisors and their advice cost me money !
negative	last time i got a feedback request form which i couldn_'_t fill out .
positive	the item was cheaper_than all the other_companies we had looked into .
positive	will definitely use the whisky_exchange in the future .
neutral	i have noticed links to mr_memory offering discount or promotion_codes .
negative	00 . 00 came and went - no bath .
positive	fast delivery , next_day delivery was dispatched whithin00mins of ordering - very impressed .
negative	when you send flowers it is usually for a significant reason and i was disappointed to find out the gesture was of shadowed by the poor quality of the flowers .
negative	they are unusable .
neutral	over priced drinks and cold food spoilt my trip .
neutral	r winfield
neutral	- instead of the four screws required for each hinge - there is only two .
neutral	poor communication really !
negative	innertubes missing from my order and no responses from wiggle .
negative	martin lawrence
neutral	as working full time , shopping was not an option .
positive	always had fantastic service from heinnie_haynes , just cant_fault them .
neutral	they then told me , the supplier no_longer provided the green & white and that the website was being corrected .
positive	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don_'_t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that '_s why there are so many negative_reviews .
positive	i have never ordered from this company before .
positive	i always use it when shopping or even e baying as some money back is always nice !
negative	each time i call it seems as of the problem is going to sort_out and they say they will get back but they don_'_t .
negative	the other option was to break the contract which would cost me £_000 !
neutral	i had to wait for a month for my products to arrive .
positive	i can '_t fault my buying experience from ao .
positive	very helpful phone conversation to get exact code of the part .
neutral	as a beginner i was shown how to set_up the rod , attach weight , bait line and hook and also how to cast which was really useful .
neutral	haven_'_t really stayed in once since though as put off !
neutral	they were apologetic but it meant a trip into_town to return the unwanted item even_though there was no postage to pay .
negative	if one side has a voice and doesn_'_t have to pay , why should the other be disadvantged ?
negative	i find their subscriptions renewal procedures dubious .
positive	can '_t wait to use their services again
positive	thankfully my dress is 000_% perfect !
positive	0 .
positive	it truly is amazing and i am so grateful to my husband who treated me to it .
neutral	sorry .
negative	found alternatives , went down same process , same result .
negative	rip_off , don_'_t do it .
neutral	the experience had it '_s good points and it '_s bad points !!!
neutral	i am utterly threaders with having to relearn where everything is every few_months , and as for you deciding what you think i might find important , well . you ain '_t god dude .
positive	the prices are amongst the best available .
neutral	i realize that it is difficult to compare but ebay and amazon deliver within days .
neutral	when i called the lady wasn_'_t all that helpful , and she seemed like she didn_'_t want to be there .
neutral	i do love the clothes ive bought jumpers , skirts and coats oh and boots , all lasted well and washed well ( appart from boots lol ) but the items are sooo pricey i usually wait for the sales
neutral	there was no apology or suggestion of a refund .
neutral	given that they send out wheels all the time , you would think there would be a better compensation mechanism in place to cover damage .
negative	i mean i '_m_sure if you wanted to post an item and it end up at completely the wrong_address then they are great .
neutral	rather disappointed about content of mixed seed order but the birds will be the best critics !
positive	first time that i had used this company and will again .
neutral	the vaginal pumps need instructions on how to make them stick and stay in place and the website needs to updated more to show items out of stock .
positive	i found what i wanted really easy and as a novice this was very important .
positive	only issues i had was that the cost of delivery could have been 0 / 0 pound cheaper apart_from that very happy thank_you .
positive	truely fantastic and very worthwhile savings .
neutral	i like to praise as well as criticise but find that most people are more negative than positive about their experiences which unfortunately can damage small_businesses .
neutral	i am moving because i consider sky to have poor customer service .
neutral	however we had our car broken into resulting in a side window being broken and damage to the windscreen .
negative	miss k young
negative	nothing .
positive	highly_recommend this site to anyone_wishing to save_money !!
positive	really good service and the product is always first_class .
neutral	i was told storagemart was the best place for my belongings .
negative	its the first time i tried to use them & unfortunately it will be my last as i have no trust in this company .
positive	i recently ordered some hard_wax oil from wood_finishes direct and was very pleased with the whole sales process .
negative	she said no but we will be with you shortly .
positive	there '_s no need to say any more than the kit was competitively_priced and arrived when they said it would .
negative	i wish i had used another company now as my dogs are out of treats for two_days .
positive	have ordered snails & frogs legs at christmas & more recently the aussie bbq pack .
neutral	looks good and would buy normal blinds again .
neutral	nice villa as per description
negative	great help she was !!
positive	ordered a heritage solid_oak toilet_seat which was considerably_cheaper on this site than competitors .
neutral	before going , they still had not arrived and customer_services only replied to my email after i had left to go on holiday .
neutral	so the flippin hole was too_big to grip the shower pole , therefore useless .
negative	i sourced one and paid extra money for next_day delivery through interlink_express .
negative	i explained my situation and was told that they couldn_'_t fit me in til monday as they were too busy over the weekend .
neutral	i try not to shop too much at tesco because i don_'_t like their domination .
neutral	after entering these , one can be left_wondering_why nothing else is happening , if one fails to notice that the ' continue ' button is out of sight below the bottom of the window .
neutral	i am constantly targeted with email but never i am i offered any loyalty_rewards .
positive	an excellent response .
negative	so adding 0 more days on to that will make it a full week since i placed my order !!
negative	shabby customer service , i '_m afraid .
negative	sales and customer_services staff sound like they are being forced to take your call at gunpoint and go out of their way to be combative and rude , and try to make you sound like you ' re stupid ( hey , i '_m not the one working in a call_centre trying to upsell for a scam merchant ).
negative	he then said he would transfer me to the right person .
positive	great service - very helpful advice for a new customer and great final designs !
neutral	considering overall cost would have thought these relatively minor_issues should never occur .
neutral	quick reliable and cheap !
neutral	service was good , but some flowers had broken blooms and they didnt look fresh .
negative	also the steering_wheel column feels loose .
neutral	glasses were very competitively_priced however the lenses are really hard to clean as they are plastic .
positive	np are now in my favourites .
positive	they have a wonderful selection of customizable products and the products are high_quality .
positive	awesome first experience and will_definitely use again .
negative	the organiser is useless , she told us we could decorate the room in the daytime and then booked another party in without mentioning it .
neutral	refreshed and ready for our onward trip .
positive	excellent service , and i also received a promo_code to give me a discount off my next purchase .
positive	a great online florist !
negative	i sent an_email enquiring if qs_supplies had a briston tap in stock .
positive	many_thanks .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find anywhere that could replace the screw so bought the full slide arm from partmaster for £_00 . 00 plus £ 0 . 00p &_p .
negative	i can '_t_believe_how bad this service is compared to iplayer and 0od .
negative	no time was on it so i used my phone and checked the tracking_details .
negative	tbh it was a total_con job , low price on booking but actually works out dearer in the long run .
neutral	although my mother got her flowers , which so said were lovely .
negative	well if what they delivered is the same or better , then i '_m a monkeys uncle !
neutral	have booked a few hotels with this company and sorry but they have competition which is far nicer , cleaner and comfier !
positive	very good slick_operation that is always right first time .
neutral	on our return we thought that the signs for the car - park were really poor .
negative	weeks passed and i was very busy so decided to give them another try as i had read good reviews .
positive	bar_stools look amazing .
neutral	but the delivery guy isnt interested in it and there is no email address for customer service , you have to phone up to complain .
negative	i emailed three_times , and rang twice .
negative	the promotion of <_external link_removed_> by wowcher implies that they endorsed the product / company .
positive	a great service , sold phone in less_than 0 minutes , returned the phone and had my money in the bank within less_than 0 days from selling .
negative	they took the cost out of my bank_account and when i complained they refused to refund the full_amount and charged me £_00 . 00 as a cancellation_fee despite the fact that i had been kept waiting for almost 0 hours and i did not cancel my booking - enterprise wanted more money than i had agreed to pay .
positive	no_complaints at all .
negative	thanks
positive	of them again .
neutral	!
neutral	i bought the xl protein and straight_away was taken_aback at the dampish appearance in texture of it .
negative	on arrival back from our holiday we discovered that we had parked in the mid term as_opposed to the long_term , which we had booked . the lady at the kiosk told us our error and we insisted on seeing her manager . she was not very helpful but did reluctantly agree to call her . when the woman came and explained it to us , i was very angry with her attitude . we were angry with having to pay an extra £_00 on top of the £_000 we had paid for 0 cars , but i have to say far angrier with her rude and obnoxious and patronising manner . i did not write to you about the incident as she made it very clear that you the b . a . a .
negative	it came in the evening 0 days_later .
neutral	while in the store last friday00th i asked if it would be possible to purchase the 0 on show as the label said " take home today " and was told no .
negative	the clips were ok but the dive log binder did not fair so well .
positive	crushing and adding to food is a total_waste of time , they know .
neutral	we bought a shower_screen for my daughter who_lives on her own in a flat on the first floor .
negative	gumtree needs to more accountable to sellers .
neutral	using collect_+ is also ideal as it bypasses the post_office and have literally walked in and straight of my local shop dropping the parcels off .
positive	i was very pleased with my order .
positive	i ordered an aeg tumble_dryer on next_day delivery .
positive	very good product ,( small washing line ), excellent service .
neutral	trying washing up liquid , silicone grease , or soaking the seal in warm water made no difference .
positive	staff are very friendly and helpful if you have to contact them .
neutral	that order wasn_'_t good value .
positive	everything is a0 will be looking to use again no problem
positive	would not_hesitate in placing an other order with this company .
neutral	previously it has arrived almost the next_day so this is i suspect ( and hope ) a temporary glitch .
neutral	the engineer was very good and 0 tyres_replaced and tracking done efficiently .
positive	i read some reviews and was happy to place my trust in a company i hadn_'_t previously ordered from .
negative	demanded refund , but clearly not expecting that to come anytime_soon , nor do i expect to receive any communication about it .
negative	i received a call on my phone from a number i did not recognise .
positive	if you ' re looking for something beauty wise from top branded fragrances to hand_cream , give these people a look .
neutral	dot the is and cross the ts on the order detail .
positive	very pleased with the service .
neutral	it seems really good on the website but in reality , it didn_'_t really feel like a trophy .
neutral	having said that , the item was packaged well and as_described .
neutral	the sides were warped and nails hanging out in places .
negative	newsflash : do believe all you see and read about bt .
positive	made buying a car enjoyable , would i use again , definitely .
negative	other_sites just don_'_t let you order i '_d you exceed the quantity allowed inadvertently .
neutral	which is pretty_much a dorm room , but it alowes hostels to make it look like there prices are a lot lower .
negative	currently this may take up to 00 working_days ' poor , poor service - avoid at all costs
positive	top girl !!!!
positive	i can_honestly_say that the site was very easy to use , photos very good quality and the rugs when they arrived were fantastic quality .
negative	we kept receiving invoices , direct_debit instructions and then finally started receiving notice that they were stopping our service which we had not used for months .
negative	my local interlink depot spokesperson has told me that the courier involved , says he went back to the flats yesterday ( 00st_jan ) to investigate and sort_out with the customer but could not gain_access and that the customer was not in - completely false as the customer has_been there since sunday and is still there .
negative	my gut tells_me trustpilot cannot be trusted .
neutral	it took the gloss off an otherwise good service .
negative	told in my first email it would be delivered in 0 - 0 working_days that was on the 00 / 00 /_0000 @ 00 : 00 am .
negative	.
neutral	still , if ever you recognise an actor but can '_t get his_name off the tip off yer tongue then imdb ( or wiki ) will be there for you to put yer out of yer misery .
neutral	the courier service should be notified of the problem , but we do not hold nets 0 go at fault for this .
positive	however , that being said , the whole purchase to delivery experience was excellent !!
neutral	tie was of disappointing quality but most disappointing was the hat .
neutral	the perfume was ordered on 00 march and arrived on 0 april .
neutral	had i have not rang up , i would still have said for an item i was never going to receive !
positive	would definitely recommend this company , very competitively_priced items and fast delivery
positive	brilliant product but better service .
neutral	the other thing is that the camera nikon_coolpix l000 does not employ a driver for the software that comes with the kit .
positive	fast , efficient service - much_appreciated , and goods of the best quality .
negative	not really worth the one star_rating .
negative	they said i wasnt actually eligible for the offers i had originally been promised and wud have to pay the extra £_00 each_month - i would never ever pay this much for a phone contract .
neutral	i still had plenty left so sent an_email asking them to suspend the order .
positive	!

positive	my son was very excited to get his new scooter and thank_god he only has to wait one day before the super_fast delivery arrived .

positive	communication and billing set - up was easy , i received many updates about my order though to delivery on time and as scheduled .

negative	in the year i was with them i was never once able to submit a meter_reading ( due to their incompetent staff and website ) and therefore had to pay the maximum every singe month .
neutral	these do not overlap easily so hope this will not rust .
negative	i was charged_twice .
neutral	how much extra have you made through people assuming they can '_t get what they were quoted , and who were panicked into booking for more than advertised in case it went up yet again ?

neutral	the order process was very simple but at the checkout it was clear as to whether it would be immediate delivery or a date could be chosen .
negative	mighty seals are a total_rip_off
negative	i called when i landed .
neutral	it may be great for everyone_else , but its not my cup of tea .

negative	i used their very easy website to book my cleaner 00 days in_advance and almost_immediately , received confirmation from them .

positive	have recommended on facebook , which i never do , as i am so impressed .

negative	but on our return to the uk we were left waiting for almost two hours
neutral	flowers were ok but there was too few .
positive	quick and easy website , with no_hidden cons .

negative	i called again and got the same person .
negative	hopefully won_'_t be much longer before i receive the two outstanding products ,
neutral	.
neutral	i have therefore had to take additional leave .

negative	original review
neutral	£ 0000 . money most definately not well spent .
positive	free also .
neutral	product as_described but nest day delivery did not happen
neutral	but in this day and age , a website ought to be able to give an accurate " in stock " status , i feel , so it '_s still not ideal .
neutral	all in all rentalcars . com is a service i ' d use again .
positive	davpak do seem to try_harder than most , getting boxes available that fitted the new royal_mail sizing as soon as it was introduced was a smart move and one their competitors who we usually use didn_'_t respond to .
negative	after nothing improved by end of second week i said i wanted to ' escalate my complaint '.
neutral	over a week_later , i '_d had no communication from them ( apart_from a ' rate your experience ' email , ironically ).
neutral	i have also found that they are very quick to return money to a purchaser without understanding the issue properly , seems like the seller is assumed to be at fault and this makes me wary about using paypal on and high loss transaction .
neutral	i am especially impress wth the good service in terms of emails and deliveries that were done on time .
positive	delivery was very fast , and the product was value for money .
neutral	james
neutral	we have noticed your facilities for children improve over the years but on this trip it failed you .

neutral	but - we had some technical problems & she always went off to ' ask someone '.
neutral	the service was some what rushed and we got the feeling that we an inconvenience to the cabin_crew , they would have been happier if the business class cabin would have been empty .
negative	inghams purposely hide this additional_cost and as such obtained my booking by deception .
neutral	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .

positive	communication over the phone was fantastic .
positive	i used the uk_pianos website and downloaded the online guide about digital_pianos , which i found very informative and helpful .
neutral	it took too long for the drivers to arrive at the terminal after notification .
neutral	very pleased with customer service support with dimension information and drawings prior to delivery .
neutral	i really cant imagine that so much stock changes that much in just a couple of days .
negative	not very satisfactory .
positive	bought a used cassette , turned_up promptly and works_perfectly , the rating system and description made it easy to know what i was going to be getting as buying used parts can sometimes be a bit hit and miss .
negative	-.
positive	well_done everybody .
neutral	so i called to let them know and request a replacement .
positive	the images on the website were detailed enough to get a good impression of what the glasses looked like .

negative	when you rang back you said that it would be about half an_hour as the lorry was 00 miles_away which would take about 00 to 00_minutes .
negative	not mentioning that i had requested a seat selection to tripsta '_s staff few weeks before the trip , because i could not log in into asiana '_s airlines with my reservation number , but the staff couldn_'_t help me and did not suspect something was wrong .
neutral	returning the car was also slow as we waited five_minutes for someone to inspect again and then a further ten_minutes as there was no one working the returns desk .

positive	i definately recommend .
positive	easy ordering ; great prices and fast hassle_free delivery .
neutral	this is the second time i '_ve_used your service and i was very happy the first time round .
positive	it was about half theprice of a leading discount furniture store for what to me looks_like theexact same product .
negative	and wanted to know a day the following week when someone would be available to pick the table up ….
negative	i phoned them and talked to a woman_who had no time or compassion for my predicament .

neutral	£_000 return , with no extras , except one piece of hold_luggage .
negative	i won_'_t recommend this site to anyone .
positive	my recent -- second -- order was based on my satisfaction & confidence from my first experience .
negative	the girl on the phone made it sound like i was ridiculous expecting the delivery company to deliver to my flat , i think its ridiculous that they expect me to pay £_00 delivery to have the items dumped on the pavement outside my flat !
neutral	it means that unless the trampoline is on 000_% flat ground at_least one of the poles lifts on the bounce of the trampoline and there is a real danger it could collapse .

positive	my product arrived two_days_later .
neutral	i was very impressed with the products and their appeal online and pleased with the quality on arrival to be used for my childrens baking parties business .
neutral	the efficiency of your company with the actual order when it was placed was very good .

negative	in the end we got a refund and got the parcel delivered cheaper with hermes .
neutral	i then received an e_- mail that provided a proof of delivery with my surname on it , so i can only_assume that the driver has signed on my behalf and then left the package , otherwise he wouldn_'_t have left a card ?!
neutral	i have been told on my email to pick_up the tickets on our arrival to the port but where do i pick them up ?
positive	national_tyres did the job for me with the same oil for £_00 . 00 .

positive	quidco is the very best cashback site on the internet .
negative	don_'_t use wren , this was the 0nd mistake and the worker i hired to fix the wardrobes charged me extra for having to use his own !
negative	the seller called them and they said delivery had been attempted twice !
positive	and finally delivery was just fast just as promised .
negative	only a refund will due now , both serenata and yodel are not doing all that is claimed on the website , totally_unacceptable .
positive	well_done and thank_you scott for your very pleasant and caring_attitude we can highly_recommend you .
negative	the seller then told me to got to a tailor to have it altered as it would be cheaper_than funding a return .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	had i known this i may not have bought it .

neutral	dissapointed with the delivery as i payed for next_day and it didn_'_t come for 0 days .
negative	this wouldn_'_t have been so bad but the receipts from the website i ordered from are collectable as they carry a pleasant view of a stand at anfield .

positive	i was informed every_step of the way from when they were being packaged to when they had been delivered !
neutral	i was going to order a shower cabinet but am a little_apprehensive .
positive	the only_negative_point is the alarming speed at which we used up the toners supplied with the printer .
neutral	the service on arrival was quick but on return there was no thank_you from the assistant who had a grumpy face .
neutral	i found the site / service given by skypark_secure excellent .
positive	the parcel took less time than estimated which was great considering it was a christmas_present !
neutral	it used to be the sum total of your order could be spread over 00 weeks or 00 weeks , now it '_s each_individual item which can make the payments too high therefore limiting the number of items bought , so catalogue is missing out on profit .
negative	will never use you again and will make it my business tell let everyone know that i can
negative	how can i recover the situation ?
negative	side note - this company is deliberately blocking negative_reviews to boost there positive_feedback .
negative	i have been chasing this since before christmas .

negative	that hello article gave a discount_code that could be used if the order was placed within a specific timeframe . my order was placed in that timeframe , but the discount_code was not accepted on line so i did not get the 00_%_discount . i still went_ahead . i knew when i placed the order that the item would not be dispatched until approx 00rd feb , which was fine . i then received an e_mail from customer_services asking if i did still want to proceed with the order in view of dispatch delay . i immediately replied to that e_mail , to confirm the order . in that e_mail i asked that someone should please look into and contact me to explain_why the discount_code was not accepted . to date , no one has bothered to do so . this was my first order from blacckleaf . at this rate , i am unlikely to place another order
neutral	i cant_fault the fast service but they had given the delivery people an incorrect_address so poor driver spent 0o minutes trying to find us .
negative	i '_m an long time user of paypal .
positive	as a tentative internet shopper , i was very comfortable buying items here .
neutral	we were accepted into bars we were not previously allowed into due to guest lists .
positive	they helped_me out to understand what is what and i believe that i '_ve chosen right dvr for my purpose .
neutral	this is disappointing as the box was not even opened and even after i emailed to query this they would not budge .
positive	all goods delivered after 00_hrs with the driver calling 00mins before delivery .

positive	yes , theirs something a little special about going into a plush ad & buying your watch , it '_s a personal event , but with the money i saved buying from ironic i was more then happy to trust them & the service they provided .
negative	she had the nerve to tell me phone them on monday then .
negative	i dont care if i dont get the max broadband_connection , i just want a workable line .
negative	i too have had atrocious service from hermes on selling something on ebay and i am_appalled that companies such as monsoon and next are using such a rogue company and shan '_t be shopping online without checking which couriers people are using first .
negative	this is beacause they forced all passengers into the worst seats .
neutral	me and a friend managed to do it , admittedly after taking it out of the packaging , but i reckon in today '_s society if that is what it takes to deliver the delivery service you advertise , that is what should be done .
negative	well , after visiting the yodel website , clicking on yodel direct , setting_up an account of i went ,
neutral	on the positive_side gold car provided us with a brand_new car and refunded the unused_fuel .

positive	i am impressed with the quality and it looks very neat on my rotary_clothes line .
negative	nobody ever answers the phone , despite_repeated emails & phone messages over weeks they have failed to respond to my request for a refund .
negative	what they also failed to do was obviously advise the couriers that they are to deliver saturday , because they turned_up yesterday morning and duly awoke our neighbour who works nights to take the delivery in for me , which did not go down well at all .
neutral	however , i don_'_t want anything posted on my fb_page or anything notified to friends which you try and sneak through .
neutral	the watch supplied was exactly as ordered with all necessary breitling international warranties .

negative	well what can i say , i have some late deliveries in my time but have never had to collect a parcel from a courier services depot , they had contact number if they had problems and for some strange reason couldnt even find my address and have many deliveries to this house , the worst ever courier service i have ever had a due to that will be changing the company who used them to send my items .
negative	00_% of the photos had heads chopped_off a waste of money .
neutral	if next time you get the games ready for download on the release day , you would get a 0_star_review and a few more customers .

neutral	however , payment is via_paypal , would have preferred other methods of payment .
positive	the order process is quick and easy to follow , and the delivery is quick .

positive	i don_'_t have to worry , just order .
negative	not helpful in any way , customers service extremely poor as flowers and delivery paid for in full not recieved as requested . however its was to be delivered to wrong door number , nothing was done to resolve the situation at the time enquring . i recieved no flower as a result no clear explaination from the call_center or respond to what happened . very poor service .

negative	brilliant !
neutral	i have to say the admin_team and lorraine in particular were brilliant , answered all my questions / emails promptly .

positive	that was the first review - i had an mot from a different national a week_later to find it failed because one of the tyres had been fitted the wrong way round .
neutral	i see that tesco , asda and all the rest of them ship from the channel_islands too nowadays so they can all save on tax - while the rest of uk companies have no choice but to pay it - money goes to money as usual
neutral	they sent my boyfs pair to the wrong_address , so generally not happy with the service as probably wasn_'_t even much_cheaper_than elsewhere
positive	i thought it a little expensive at first until i looked at other_sites and found it to be very good value especially when you think parcels get from the uk to half way around the world in one day .
positive	got the goods on tuesday .

negative	will not be ordering from natures_best again .
neutral	since the release of the ipod and iphone apple have gone down_hill .

neutral	had i known it was going to be so difficult i would have driven to the store and collected it myself .
negative	i have re - scheduled for wednesday but given he / she does know where i live ( he / she didn_'_t know where i lived earlier this year either as two garden chairs from tesco were apparently delivered to me and signed for , only naturally they were not - hope the delivery driver had nothing but misery out of sitting on my chairs all summer long ) then how on earth is my expensive electrical item going to get to me on wednesday ?
negative	poor communication and customer service , a real let - down , wasting so much of my time to resolve .
neutral	message :
negative	i went to pay with them with capital bonds and the manager refused them saying they was probley stolen .
positive	i checked out quite a few on - line stores , but no one offered a better deal on the lens brand i usually wear .
positive	the drivers who delivered our order telephoned us to say they were in the area ahead of time & would it be alright to deliver our order . no_problems at all , excellent job getting 0 table , 0 chairs & 0 sideboards through a rather difficult door & hallway , not all at the same time may i say . well_done everybody .

positive	staff were kind , flexible and professional throughout .
neutral	it took hermes 0_days !!
neutral	i found purewell on the web and was amazed they were doing my dyson_vacuum £_00 cheaper_than amazon .

positive	the prices of the items was also very competitive and the delivery was free .
neutral	i work long hours as a head teacher and would prefer the snacks with a touch of hummus or something like that .

neutral	i am not sure who was at fault whether it was royal_mail not delivering the parcel on time or mazuma not checking for it but i never received my instant bank_transfer until over 00 days after i had posted the phone .

neutral	they also were sent through the regular postal service , not signed for as indicated on their website .

neutral	i do rather object to the almost constant_emails i have been receiving , however .
negative	i received the email and to my surprise there was an extra_charge of £_00 because i paid by mastercard . what a joke !
negative	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer service much_better .
neutral	i got new ones printed and that took another 0 days to get .
positive	will definitely use the site again .
negative	i was told to read their terms and conditions and they accept no responsibility whatsoever for my delivery as i opted for standard deliver service which incidentally still cost £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	however , it seems a little unprofessional to advertise goods that you are not in a position to provide and the poor communication would make me wary of ordering larger items from this company in the future .
positive	i compared the price of the product , postage and delivery ( to france ) and e_- outdoor . co . uk won .
neutral	know you can '_t maybe solve it , but why do you attract massive customers with trolleys laden with junk food and huge loaves of bread ?
neutral	we ordered our_wedding_invitation form here previously and they were lovely , so i guess we had higher expectations
positive	i had been thinking_about having_laser_surgery for a long time but had been very apprehensive .
negative	i emailed them - nothing !
negative	i cannot stress enough , buy elsewhere !
negative	i would recommend that you don_'_t bother with mopp as they are unreliable and so very frustrating .
neutral	they will now charge you £ 0 . 00 if you exchange less_than £ 0000 .
negative	they hide_behind distance_selling contract which leaves customer in the dark
positive	first experience with lindy and great service .
neutral	overcharged for product on website , emailed query and was asked to provide photograph of product pricing label .
positive	i bought a reverb stealth dropper post .
neutral	i asked_him what it means " young driver " and he said : " you have to have your driving_licence for at_least 0 . or 0 . years , otherwise you pay 0 euro_per day ".
positive	amazing service from dedicated staff . and no , i don_'_t work for them or know anyone who does !
neutral	after a succession of emails requesting that this was investigated they did finally agree to pay me for the items anyway .
negative	i spent £ 0000 on bathroom items and when the toilet arrived it was not the measurements as on the website , tried to return it and the process is very awkward , also when they received it back via a national carrier that i paid for they will not accept it because it the box was wet !
neutral	a rubbish company .
positive	the quidco app is great too - shows you bargains and cashback opportunities nearby when you ' re out and about and even gives you money for checking in to participating stores .
neutral	my friend receivwd the flowers however the address said 00 not 00 so presumably delivery person had to ask around .
neutral	admittedly the day is hot but when the box arrived - not how i expected them to turn_up at all !!
negative	00 days for delivery of products .
negative	my order did not turn_up so they sugested i order another and pay next_day delivery . i would have to wait to claim my money back . we can all afford that carnt we .
neutral	after the first few_days of waiting chemist forest contacted me to say they needed more info before releasing the item .
negative	so i guess the answer is yes , i am gullible to believe that this company are professional and honest .
neutral	a bit late as i have already put in two orders !
negative	further to my earlier comment , ive now had a reply from easy wellies who seem to think its acceptable to charge for 0 day delivery even_though they cant deliver on it then refuse to refund money saying its the fault of the weather , i have taken legal_advice and been told they are in breach of contract but as the amount is £ 0 . 00 . its not worth pursuing . iguess thats how they get away with this sort of unacceptable practice .
negative	but then a few weeks_later i received a bill for about £_000 . 00 from talktalk .
neutral	a little_slow on delivery but got item in the end and very pleased however knowledge of the product wasn_'_t to good at customer service as i was told when ordering it takes gu00_bulbs and came with product .
negative	once i saw the error i called but couldn ’_t get_hold of anyone for weeks , just got told i had to email to get the name corrected again .
positive	definitely recommend them .
negative	which is a shame .
positive	excellent service !
negative	the installation was a disaster from_start to finish and despite_numerous_emails and complaints i got nowhere so just gave up .
positive	being a club member seems well_worth the initial small payment .
neutral	we saw a lovely oak tv corner_unit on the cotswold website ( lyon petite ).
positive	mitt sista köp av blommor via euroflorist var imponerande .
negative	unbelievable !
positive	was kept well informed regarding delivery which i found excellent .
negative	very poor service !!!
positive	greenman_bushcraft provide an excellent selection of equipment at great prices with speedy and efficient service .
neutral	i ordered 0 bouquets to be delivered on 00 dec . only one was delivered on 00rd .
neutral	therefore , i go on facebook only when i am called , am unimpressed each time , and i log off asap .
neutral	great sunglasses , great price super quick delivery but sunglasses have a couple of scratches on them the scratches are not major but if i was in a shop buying them i wouldn_'_t have taken that pair especially when paying over_£_000 .
neutral	i paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to upgrade the bouquet to deluxe .
positive	overall extremely happy
neutral	the ship was on time and the crossing comfortable and the food ok .
negative	so i cancelled the order .
negative	placed an order 0 days ago on a recorded delivery due wednesday no delivery and despite 0 emails now , not one single response told them i needed it urgently for a birthday_present , so i have reported them to paypal and my credit_card company , wont ever use this company again , and i would not recommend anyone do , customer service is beyond a joke , no respect for the customer just take your money .
positive	being a novice on the internet i was recommended the company parcel0go to send my son in america a parcel . i asked for help and chatted on line to daniel who guided_me through it from beginning to end , and the price was lower_than i expected .
positive	i would highly_recommend and will certainly buy again !
negative	further to last review , i have received an email from fu , the most unprofessional email i have ever received :
negative	put you on hold at your cost and failed to deal with the refund .
positive	i won_'_t go_anywhere_else when i am looking to buy my djing products .
negative	the company then takes it up with the po not the other way around !!!!!!!!!
neutral	if they can '_t guarantee the times that they choose to advertise why do they bother ?
positive	simple to order & kept up to date with where my order was at .
negative	the way that they are organised is counter - intuitive to delivering a customer_focused business which is what they claim they want to achieve .
negative	the car engine was very warm , the fuel monitor had reduced by around 00 - 00 miles and the radio station had been charged .
positive	very quick response to questions , even during holidays .
negative	i tracked my order by yodel website and noticed that the parcel been delivered so i started live_chat on yodel website .
neutral	fits toothbrush but button hard to turn on and not as firm as original heads .
negative	my only way to communicate with you is via this trustpilot email .
positive	0st .
negative	they say that they are looking into the problem and will get back to me .
negative	otherwise stay_away .
positive	it '_s very neat and only takes up a small space on the worktop , easy to use and clean , and it heats milk perfectly without boiling over , producing a lovely stable , creamy foam which lasts to the bottom of the cup .
positive	a couple of minutes_walk to the beach and restaurants a short_stroll away made it the perfect location .
negative	they do not take any responsibility or understand the frustrations therefore it is clear to understand that i will not be placing any further orders with misguided nor are my friends .
negative	no communication , nothing .
negative	parcel picked_up ( edinburgh service centre ) 00th_dec_0000 00 : 00
positive	the prices clearly showed whether they included_vat or not , unlike_other competing websites who leave you in the dark until the final stages of payment .
neutral	but sadly i find it very disappointing when i ask for a delivery between five hours and it '_s missed completely !!
positive	0 excellent service , communication , delivery faster_than a speeding_bullet !
negative	everything was fine for a few_months until now !!
neutral	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
positive	thank_you very much for such a professional service .
positive	adjustable fit so can even out the patio slabs . considering i was going to buy the full set , the table at £_000 was great and buy the chairs another time .
neutral	it would be great to see them invest a bit of money in developing the site so that it secures more customer confidence .
positive	really fast delivery and kept_uptodate regarding order .
neutral	it made such a mess of our house and garden and had to make two trips to the tip to dispose of it .
negative	i sent an email to viagogo to inform them of this , that it has_been more than 00_hours and no confirmed ticket , so consider the order cancelled .
neutral	i ordered 000_pounds worth of shoes / sandals they took over a week to arrive , good job i wasn_'_t off on me jollies . they were well_packaged and the site offers a refund or exchange on any sent back , it will be interesting to see how long that takes ?
positive	we cooked a roast dinner for six using the meat last sunday .
negative	. why ?
neutral	the woodstain provided is awful , barely covering the wood and despite six coats is being now being washed away by rain !
negative	ordered 00 june .
neutral	then was told they phoned me with a new delivery date .
positive	arrived nice and quick goods as_described at a good price with a good selection of products .
positive	everything i have ever ordered has arrived within 00_hours and is usually with me the next_day .
neutral	the ch make the games enjoyable and are great .
neutral	called monday and spoke to cs and the replacements were ordered without an issue and these also arrived at 0am the next_day .
positive	i '_ll definitely use iconic_watches again and would highly_recommend them to anyone !
negative	according to my online a /_c it was dispatched on the 00th_jan despite me cancelling the order on the 00th .
neutral	it turned_out that the firm was selling to me from the channel_islands ( presumably to save vat ), and the goods were mailed from a small town in switzerland .
neutral	but as stated your sales_team apologised and communicated very well .
neutral	it felt me and my colleagues who accompanied me feel_ripped_off .
neutral	there is a reason for this - often the products are substandard .
positive	their service is excellent , the website is easy to use and paying via_paypal couldn_'_t be simpler .
negative	i spent_nearly_£_000 on two bouquets and gifts . they ( or the florists employed ) muffed both orders up .
neutral	have brought from amazon many_times and mostly i find good prices and delivery but have also had some issues in the past when the goods aren_'_t shipped by amazon themselves but via other_sellers .
positive	will definitely us them again .
negative	and that '_s where we ' re at .
negative	as you can appreciate , i am not a professional_photographer , that aside the photographs are a true_representation of the mattress that i received , whether the manufacturer says that this is a fault or not under the sale of goods_act 0000 i am entitled to a full re - imbursement due to the product being i feel not as_described as certainly not of satisfactory quality .
negative	deliveryman basically throw the bouquet into the frontdoor .
positive	the money received then came by cheque , so the service took a little_longer .
neutral	i prefer the former ( ffc ).
negative	so repairs0 block out comments if they do not like them ?
positive	product arrived well_packaged and as_described .
neutral	we '_ve ordered a lot of times through mine and my partners account .
neutral	but they need not to take money for items they do not hold in stock and have no idea when they will have in stock and they seriously need to learn customer service .
neutral	before retiring i worked in customer_care and the very team need to start thinking_about the customer and not their workload !
neutral	there were only two annoying problems .
neutral	if ithe welly size is correct at 0 then all should be ok . get in touch later because this a xmas_gift .
positive	so it saved me waiting in all day to sign for it .
positive	the ordering_process was very easy , with flexible payment options .
negative	should not take payments for things you don_'_t have in stock .
negative	i received a free no_obligation quote from a company , they then harassed me with calls and so i put a negative_review .
negative	if the necessary bank information was necessary because i am canadian , and not a european citizen you should have a disclaimer before someone wastes their time with you .
negative	talk about late notice .
negative	this has put me in a predicament , which could of been avoided if levels of organisation and customer_care within the cotsworld company were at a satisfactory level ; in this time i could have had the product designed and built from scratch .
neutral	the first time i ordered a jumper to try them out was extremely bad .
positive	me cannot say enuff great things about this fantastic company .
negative	consistently ignoring the information provided in the phone_calls and emails , like the fact that our outbound_journey dates had been changed .
negative	you state that i have to return the pair - which means i will not be able to use my computer . i would have purchased another set from you and would willing have done this for a credit reimbursement when the defective pair had been returned .
positive	bought a newly_released game the deluxe special_edition for over half the price from elsewhere , and i '_m really happy with my purchase .
positive	!
neutral	that was there stance and refused to budge - even_though i spent over_£ 0 , 000 which was a shame as i was in 0 minds to cancel the order and go to other_suppliers but because of timings and i needed the goods asap i had to bite me bottom lip and order - other wise it would have been a great experience had they reduced the item to price match - bit of a shame really " its the little gestures that keep customers coming_back
negative	date of lens received back by se : 00th_august_0000
negative	although the frames and lenses were sent back within about 0_weeks , the vision on one side was blurry and i couldn_'_t use them .
neutral	i '_ve just registered for a loyalty_card membership .
positive	definitely recommend .
neutral	he offered to rebook me with an " on airport " rental company - both of whom were served by the bus i was stood waiting for .
positive	a good fast service and on time too .
negative	!
negative	i called them over time after time and they make me wait to check the price to see if i '_m lying and they always return and apologise .
neutral	it is like saying devon is in cornwall .
positive	pleaced my order , paid for it , arrived in less_than 00_hours , well pleased with the service
positive	this company has never let us down .
positive	the website was so easy to use and was sent the packaging within a couple of days , so i could post my phone .
negative	i see that this is not a one off either .
neutral	despatch was first_class , very prompt .
negative	received phone the next_day on the completely incorrect contract costing_£ 0 more per_month !
neutral	communication could be better , stock_availability could be better .
neutral	they should have been red_roses in it and there were none .
neutral	when i emailed the showershop they said the would look into it as it was usually accepatble .
positive	i '_ve not had ppi trouble , nor in real need for much of what mse sends out - but an invaluable site to get sound_advice on everything that may involve spending money
positive	easy to get through on the phone and everyone i have spoken too are friendly and helpful .
negative	as things stand i have paid this company nearly 00 pounds , have not seen any goods and am rapidly running out of any hope of doing so .
neutral	i '_ve purchased a few supplements in the past with great service and fast delivery . hopefully more consideration for the buyer in the future if this should happen again !!
positive	overall a very good experience .
positive	and only deal with one main bank_account address
neutral	some of the staff could do with a customer_care course .
positive	the service i received from lenstore is just brilliant .
positive	ordering is great , and the clothes are super cute .
negative	also paid for next week delivery only to be told the next_day that it wasn_'_t possible and now looking at a month for delivery so don_'_t trust them re delivery dates .
negative	we explained this to the md and he said ' your problem not ours ' a couldnt care less attitude .
negative	zhongshan road
negative	ive had such irregular speeds with this fibre_broadband that i am seriously thinking of going to the press .
positive	they are well made , adaptable and the customer service on the website was fine .
neutral	the item was not the freesia bunch which i had ordered it was important as my mother for whom they were sent to has failing sight and the fragrance is why i chose them .
neutral	glasses_direct were very good at responding to my request for a solution and i returned the glasses .
neutral	when i had my problem with an order due to myhermes , asos were essentially useless and just asked me to " wait a little_longer " and to contact them if it still had not arrived by a certain_date .
neutral	easy process art from one thing .
neutral	i have been using the phone for 00 months so of course wear and tear will happen .
positive	i was very impressed .
positive	bought tickets , was contacted and confirmed via_email .
negative	idiots !!
neutral	satisfied with the quality of the shed structure but a shame that the doors supplied did not fit resulting in a great deal of time and effort re - cutting and re - shaping to make the shed secure .
negative	i emailed again to complain that they ' d lost my cd '_s and what were they going to do about it .
negative	i received one bowl few_days_later and there was no invoice included .
negative	very poor service .
negative	they are either completely disorganised or completely dishonest .
negative	i had my phone stolen a month_ago . just received a letter from protectyourbubble telling_me my second appeal has_been denied !!
negative	coming_back was no better .
positive	just great .
neutral	their quality control could be improved .
negative	online repair form filled in and returned and i was called back , being promised a freepost_envelope for the non - working item 0 year into the warranty .
neutral	very poor .
negative	my advice pay a little more and shop else where .
negative	it appears that iflorist has removed my review .
positive	bought descaler this time using a money off voucher .
negative	i phoned fedex and it took 00min 00seconds on hold to get through to their customer_services who stated used the ref given and could not find my parcel , then they asked for the address i had sent my item too .
neutral	jewelers said it was not properly set and added onto the base of the ring .
negative	i showed him proof of how long we had waited and the tracking_number and that was the end of the matter .
positive	not only did they offer either a full_refund or a replacement tent , but even spent a long period of time to help me choose an_alternative .
neutral	originally led to believe ticket would arrive two_weeks before event but when it didn_'_t , each time i viewed my account it said it could arrive later and later !.
positive	delighted with the help i received when phoning for advise on different_types of skies .
negative	i have now been offered an_alternative colour which is not acceptable .
negative	!
positive	it '_s nice to order from a company that shows care to it '_s customers and offers such a professional service !

positive	i ordered over the phone as i needed some advice about fitting .
negative	i have wore this perfume for years and this is the only bottle i have had that loses it '_s scent after 00mins of putting it on , don_'_t waste your money on a snide
neutral	however , compared to the bouquet on display on the website , it looked very small and was a bit_disappointing .
positive	my horse has leg mites it has cost me hundreds of pounds in treatment that hasn_'_t worked so a last_resort i '_m trying liquid parrafin on his legs it seems to be working fingers_crossed he is bitting lumps out of himself
negative	i didn_’_t get a confirmation or even acknowledgement of payment so i emailed myukdelivery on the 00 / 00 / 00 they didn_’_t reply !
neutral	that would be a miracle .
negative	instead he said he would arrange for someone to collect it the next_day and leave me without a bed for a minimum of four_weeks ( the length of time is would take to receive another bed ).
positive	i started a medicine chest for my grandaughter , who is about to set_up her first home , and ther is no substitue to having a good medicine cabinet , health is your most_important asset
positive	i have used higher_nature for quite a few_years as their product standard is high .
neutral	they are completely_useless and this has_been the case on several_occasions .
neutral	look great when down and drawn closed though .
negative	when i told her i didn_'_t like her attitude , she said she didn_'_t like mine either !
positive	would recommend .
negative	while the product was fine , the delivery ruined the whole_thing .
negative	i did then contact the managing_director of maplin , but even he could not be bothered to reply , so i stopped dealing_with the company , also redirecting all the educational orders i once forwarded to them .
negative	all other laptops were the same or had heavy security weights on them .
neutral	to be honest if you get 00 / 00 vision from laser_eye_surgery than brilliant but sadly i did not , though i still have to keep paying for another 0 years on a service that was not completed !
negative	i never got a straight answer to that question and that '_s when the real nightmare began .
neutral	the ordering was simple and fast though done if the tick_boxes were so out of place on the product pages i had to sit and workout what flavour i was ordering .
positive	all in all myself and the family are delighted with the product , fantastic , thank_you .
neutral	from then on it was a familiar story of poor communication , endless chasing , never returning calls , but was no worse than i expected .
neutral	rang at 0 . 00 , kept hanging for some time , then told to leave a message .
negative	i was happy with this .
neutral	bought a wooden kitchen trolley in march_0000 ebay id - 000000000000 from these_people trading on ebay under the seller name discounthomestore ( since stopped trading on ebay and the web under this name ).
negative	i opened the jiffy_bag and slipped out my shiny white iphone .
negative	placed orders in excess of £_0k , customer service needs_addressing , email response slow and abrupt .
negative	are webcreation_uk aware of this ?
neutral	tile_mountain phoned my mobile at 00am mon and left message to say they were now being delivered which was no good because no one was in .
negative	0_star is 0_stars too many
positive	will buy from again .
positive	great service .
neutral	other_suppliers do not do this , and offer a cheaper option when purchasing multi items .
negative	you are not perfect , i am afraid .
negative	* they are shut at weekends .
neutral	where would my parcel have ended_up ?
neutral	when you book , you don_'_t clear_instructions of what happens when you get there .
positive	nothing bad to say .
neutral	hi just placed an order with this web_site physioroom , stuff was dispatched on the 00 of aug its now the 00th still no order has arrived , heading off on holiday now for a couple of weeks in a bit pain so will be a while before i get my order or if i get it very disappointed .
neutral	the quality of the worktop was excellent but the surly , unhelpful , jobswoths that deliver the items made the over all experience poor
negative	i did that and still no delivery .
neutral	when they did not arrive i contacted the shop only to find that were not in stock and had to be ordered from the manufacturer .
negative	as these two arms were fitted to the exact_same fitting points that the previous two arms were fitted ( they lasted for 0 - 0 years ) then one would assume if the fitting is incorrect , then the previous arms should have broken !!
positive	i call that service .
neutral	first time ever i got a dud but ill stick to my usual caran d ' ache brand in future for quality that works
neutral	lovely clothing , very well priced , but returns take much longer_than other_companies
negative	no call .
positive	i would recommend mr_memory .
positive	have been using ff for a few_years_now .
negative	the roses were wilted and had brown spots all over them , the greenery also had brown spots and now after 0 days they lily '_s have finally open they are white when the ones pictured were two tone pink !
neutral	i did as instructed & via procook direct as they were offering free_p_&_p .
positive	i '_ve just started_using aria but i will be sticking around !
neutral	a lot of wasted effort all_round only to find out that a product i ordered was not available .
negative	we sold our old suite for £_000 and the lady was due to collect from hull , she had hired a van .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	what can i say . after bluffing me for nearly 0_weeks ( via phone and email ) that my order was on the way , it was inexplicably cancelled .
negative	i soon offered to meet him half way but he wasn_'_t happy with anything less_than he asked .
positive	item was despatched very quickly and purchasing on - line was so simple .
negative	again , i called edf and was then told that the meter might be faulty and that i now do not have to pay the £_000 and my monthly direct_debit has dropped right back down .
neutral	the only_drawback was that i was told there would be an_email_confirmation but so far nothing has arrived .
neutral	she told me to be patient and it should arrive tomorrow .
negative	sagepay never answer their phones , there is a recorded_message_saying ' call back later ' then they hang up .
negative	laughably incompetent service !
positive	excellent communication all the way through topped_off with an excellent courier service .
negative	if this is what is happening before we '_ve even taken off , what can we expect from the holiday ?
positive	tyre - shopper '_s nominated fitter in my area has_been a five - star experience - and how far is that above our normal encounters at a tyre - fitters ?
neutral	my husband thinks that they are ok .
positive	only_slight bit of confusion was with yodel who turned_up very late .
neutral	i '_m impressed with their service .
negative	my advice dont be silly . save your money and look about , theres cheap couriers everywhere including ebay .
positive	they were very helpful and guided_me in the right_direction , and they new what they were talking_about .
negative	so i used city_link .
positive	i then ordered the tyres online ( which was incredibly easy - and cheaper ).
neutral	the reason i orgainsed a taxi is that due to my flights i left from terminal 0 and came back to terminal 0 so clearly didn_'_t check the flight details that had been requested .
positive	very interesting .
neutral	).
neutral	competition is tough so they should be making_sure that their customers are kept up to date about their order .
negative	i would not expect this kind of inferior quality being sold by your establishment and i wouldnt expect a dog to sleep on this mattress let_alone my three month_old daughter .
positive	often travel leeds /_bradford to malaga .
neutral	i thought a prompt service , but the 00 minute window to view the tiles for any breakages given that there is no exact delivery time was a bit_harsh .
neutral	unless this changes i probably_won_'_t use the site again as i like to compare_prices like for like .
neutral	well on arrival to destination waited for 0 / 0 hour for pick_up . the fiteen minute journey we were told took nearly 0 / 0 hour . on return arrived at pick_up point for time they asked . bus was 00_minutes late . driver missed one client and had to do a return to pick_up point . from there almost at airport when driver apologised and returned to resort and did a further 0 or 0 pick_up before eventually heading bak to airport . as you can_imagine was not very pleased . may think again about using resort_hoppa .
neutral	especially for £_00 .
neutral	great game and great service only problem was the bruce lee pre order code i received did not work
negative	be careful with this site , you can order an item which is in stock wait for it only to receive an_email a few_days_later saying item out of stock and a refund is being_processed .
positive	would use again . no_problems at all .
positive	perfect and super_fast .
neutral	this site is easy to use , but appears almost_identical to several other train sites in layout and prices ; is this indicative of shared data , as these sites have the same prices as each other every time i look .
neutral	they were dead by sunday 00th_may .
positive	over the years i have received hundreds of pounds by making my final purchase through_topcashback rather_than going straight through the company '_s own site .
negative	and try as i might to make contact with a human_being , i failed woefully , as each time i quoted my new number upon request , i was told to wait_until monday !
positive	the frontline i ordered for my cat was nearly_half the price it was in my local boots chemist .
neutral	in the en . d i had to leave work early to go and collect , and i really shouldn_'_t have to do this next time i '_ll try a competitor as long as they don_'_t use pracelforce .
neutral	shes were returned .
positive	my partner is serious ill and stuart may who managed our case was excellent .
positive	cant_praise them enough , really great service .
negative	ordered a fridge drawer (£_00 . 00 ) on a thursday_lunchtime to replace a broken item and paid for next_day delivery (£ 0 . 00 ) as i was on leave the following_day to receive the delivery , but was back at work the following week and would not be at home for delivery .
positive	have used a few_times before and will use again and again .
negative	?
negative	had to cancel train_tickets and hotel stay in london of the friday as travelling from newcastle so i could pick_up tickets the next_day .
neutral	so i found it a little_disappointing in that respect , although the actual book was lovely and the cover was excellent .
neutral	unfortunately , they did not arrive until 00 : 00 .
neutral	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i '_ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
positive	i '_m really impressed with the unit since it '_s been running we have had no condensation upstairs where we had a significant condensation problem .
positive	a trusted site which always has competitive_prices , massive stock with majority of it always in stock .
negative	order number_00000000 .
negative	both_times i have ordered from pet_supermarket i have had to place an identical order from another company because their service was so slow and i was unable to track where my order was .

positive	found video0dvdtransfers on - line & the rest is history .
positive	!
neutral	he missed work that needed to be done on our electrical feed which involved unexpected costs .
positive	you can '_t ask for more than that .
negative	they did not give a stuff and told me to go online if i think i can do better !
negative	shocking service .
negative	i have checked the final_bill dated 00th_july_0000 .
positive	i have used this company many_times and the service is always good .
positive	i '_m not usually one for writing_reviews , but felt it was a must for this company .
neutral	my order for a harris_tweed_jacket , placed on a saturday with the extra_cost of express delivery , was not received until ten days_later .
negative	my suggestion forget edecks .
neutral	not worth the amount i paid .
positive	the villa looks on the pics as if it might be overlooked , but it isn_'_t really .
neutral	my opticiam is cheaper so i will be going back to them unless groupon has another offer .

negative	there were several lillies lying at the bottom of the box .
negative	i went to the ba website today to book in my snowboard , but the price on the ba website was different (£_00 ) higher than the price inghams gave_me on my eticket .
neutral	this product is cheaper_than ia have found anywhere_else , but the delivery service was disgraceful . this would put me off using fragrance_expert again !
negative	i '_m still puzzling how they could loose a double mattress , measuring 0 by 0 , 00m !!!
negative	thieves that '_s all i can say . no toy no money and massive telephone bills after a number of phone_calls with no result still .
positive	but they were perfect , and a very good quality tile .

positive	the delivery is always when they say it will be 0 which makes a change when you buy something online !)
positive	cannot_fault the transaction ; excellent price , free delivery and very quicklyrecieved .
neutral	in addition i had specifically_requested that the water bag / bouquet was placed within a brightly_coloured square cardboard_box so it would stand independently and not pose a problem for the recipients - this did not happen and the bouquets therefore were tricky to deal with throughout .
negative	if you like this type of deals website maybe use groupon .
neutral	good site and service but please leave us alone once done .
neutral	0_days since being advised that goods have been despatched by 0nd_class mail .
neutral	there was just so so much of it .

neutral	when i first tried to ring i got brushed off .
neutral	aaa stated in summary above

positive	prompt delivery too - and i live up a hill in the back of beyond !
neutral	my experience with oak_furniture_land was on the whole very good .
neutral	however after choosing ryanair as there flights where so cheap , it didn_'_t turn out that way .
neutral	customers should be allowed to submit feedback re agents handling of their goods .
positive	although the delivery quoted 0 - 0 days ( from memory ), i was amazed and pleased when th mower arrived by lunchtime the following_day .
neutral	however it was a powershot sd 000 which was sent , which is the us version of the same camera , complete with us battery_charger .
neutral	i ordered products to be delivered while i was away on holiday ready for use on my return .

negative	i will now have to prune it well down and hope it regrows .
neutral	i am_delighted with the amp but was disappointed after i had set it all up to find that it had a continental_plug on and i did not have the appropriate adapter .
negative	i eventually put in a claim with my credit_card , and lo and behold about a week_later the stuff appeared .
negative	unfortunately , two of the threaded bars that fix the legs to the table were of the wrong_size - i reported this to them and was told by email that i would get a call on the 00th to arrange replacement parts .
neutral	regards_keith gray

positive	as soon as it was reported they dispatched a replacement plus a free whole chicken as an_apology .
neutral	people from a neighbouring villa advised that there were at_least 00 people getting the villa ready the day of our arrival , which seems a bit_excessive , could it be that they were aware of a cockkroach problem but tried to play it down .
positive	this pack gives me 0 packs of isotonic , energy drinks & carb gels to try .
negative	made worse by the fact that the only reason we ordered from them was the quick delivery as we had guests for last weekend , who ended_up sitting on the chairs ( which were pre_- built ) looking at an un - assembled table with their lunches on their laps - thanks for a ruined weekend worldstores !
negative	nothing arrived , now i '_ve been told the order cannot be fulfilled and has_been cancelled , but i have not received any info regarding a refund .
negative	who , where ?
neutral	hope they are there when i arrive .
neutral	reasonable_prices .
negative	it never came .
negative	they say that there are seats available at a specific price , but then try to charge you three_times as much .
positive	the quality of glasses_direct spectacles also far_outweighed the ones from specsavers .
negative	i was advised that i cold have one pair for reading and one pair for use on a computer .
negative	multiple emails sent including a complaint email to sales , regarding lack of reply .
negative	bought some ' compatable ' epson_ink - all went well for a couple days , now printing isn_'_t possible as cartridges aren_'_t being ' recognised '.
negative	delivery was £_00 extra so , though that was good , the flowers were very poor value .
negative	they did not answer my questions sufficiently and each time i had to submit a comment through the website as_opposed to replying to the email i received ( since this is not allowed ).
negative	my advice , pay a bit more and buy from a well established , reputable_company .
positive	although we have only had two items from the pack so_far - if the quality of the remaining meat is as good as these , you will find us ordering further from you .
positive	delivery was fast and the supports are great .
positive	they were received as i had hoped with complete joy and appreciation .
neutral	on the day of delivery my wife received calls from the delivery men saying they could not leave the item without a signature which is not what was agreed and this was explained on the phone by my wife .
neutral	in the past i '_ve got exactly_what i '_ve seen on the website , so this really shook me .
positive	but the way it was handled was the best .
negative	this example shows serious incompetence and a lack of care for customers when they make a mistake .
positive	i ordered some shoes , they arrived the next_day .
positive	seamless_transaction , quick delivery , would definitely buy from this company again :)
neutral	facebook says keys will come out at_0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true

positive	after many wasted hours spent looking for our_honeymoon , i was loosing the will to live and resigning myself to the fact that we just may not be able to afford our dream getaway !
neutral	will probably search for an_alternative place to get my strings .
negative	what an embarrassing low quality service .
negative	eventually got 0 mins in the car and decided to take it further .
negative	if you can even call them a that . no structure .
negative	sitting on the metal bar and springs and huge gap at back of cushion when sat on it .
neutral	i waited and waited for delivery , the said they couldn_'_t find the house and sent it back to the depot , so i had it redelivered to another address and waited in for it only for it not to turn_up and it was dropped_off at the post_office .
negative	i am concerned because the phone i sent to them has not arrived .
positive	i would recommend essential_travel_insurance for a holiday because it was very inexpensive and provided a very good level of cover .
positive	thanks
positive	the website was easy to use , the deals they do on tyres are unreal and the whole delivery from europe was seamless and quick .
positive	what more could you ask for !
positive	i would use rawk again .
negative	stay_away from doyouspain . com and goldcar !!!
negative	i have today been contacted by the seller to say that collect_+ have classified the package as " missing ".
negative	this company use a sub - standard delivery service who cannot be contacted by phone .
neutral	however , the radiator has 000mm pipe centres .
negative	i might also suggest a quick google of what a delivery company is supposed to do , it seems you ' re struggling with this concept a little .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 updated - hermes are now claiming that they tried to deliver my item a third time at the last time was 00 : 00 , i was in until 00 : 00 , no doorbell_rang , no card left any of these soooo called 0 delivery attempts !!

neutral	despite having 0_weeks to sort this . not looking good .
positive	her previous remote had huge buttons but lots of them and she kept pressing the wrong buttons which_meant the tv has to be retuned .
negative	00rd_april_0000 i ticketed again saying that as they had not contacted me yesterday " i assume you will be conntacting me shortly within yhe next hour ".
negative	could of got better flowers at a petrol_station !
positive	having no postal cost was also great .
positive	great service , quick delivery , as_described
negative	it '_s your_own fault , dairy crest / milkandmore .
positive	once again service and efficiency as expected .
positive	great service , good value .
neutral	les tarifs sont compétitifs mais le désagrément de_livraison que_j ' ai rencontré m ' a déplu ( j ' ai passé commande le 0 décembre 0000 et à_ce jour , soit le 00 décembre 0000 , je_n ' ai toujours pas reçu mon_colis ).
positive	we wanted a specfic helmet , well our 0 year_old_son did , and not only did merlin have it in stock , where others didn_'_t , they despatched the very next_morning following my order , which was great as it was a last_minute christmas_present !
neutral	took four days to come .
negative	i was simply told they would return it to amazon and i ' d need to contact them to arrange a new one or a refund .
neutral	recieved item quite quickly but sizing was not correct .
negative	i would really recommend going else where - they may be cheap , but not worth it .
positive	i went looking for six led_bulbs for my house , and found a variety of price / shipping options from various suppliers for the bulb i was looking for .
negative	stop ?
positive	very refreshing
neutral	there were a few mix_ups . first of all the delivery came after we had closed so i went to pick it up myself , when i got there the front of the t shirts hadn_'_t been printed on , only the backs .
negative	take warning prospective buyer that there is no chance to contact the company by telephone and any email sent recieves no reply or response should you receive poor service .
negative	i have now asked paypal to investigate .
neutral	when the delivery was made i was out and although the driver claimed that he left a card i could not find it and the rescheduling of the delivery was not possible because i would be unavailable to receive it .
neutral	packing which was non_refundable even_though the goods were not up to standard .
negative	do not buy from these_people the bed i bought was delivered damaged but so called customer service came up with small_print to deny any responsibility .
positive	the site is easy to join , can use on all devices , great selection of games .
negative	after lengthy waits the girl was unable to book my crossing she said because my vehicle at 0 . 0 metres was too high .
negative	the dispensing needs much tighter control .
positive	so pleased with my wedding_invites , they are better_than_expected , many_thanks .
positive	once the order was placed , i was regularly_updated by email at every_stage of the process , including great communication from dpm the delivery people , who gave_me a delivery estimate for the next_day - not between_0am and 0pm . but between 0000 and 0000 .
negative	when i explained i wanted to speak with someone about broadband and phone , they put me through and once i explained i wasn_'_t paying their charge and had them pinned against a wall , they actually hung_up on me ( and i was being polite !
negative	i phoned back : different operator , very thick accent , he simply kept_repeating my money would be returned in 00 days to my card .

neutral	again , on arriving at the club , we weren_'_t on the guest_list !!!
positive	saw the jacket online and taunton lesiure came up with best value free_postage and also 00_%_off .
positive	the scan as you shop gadgets are fab , it makes sure you don_'_t go over budget on your shop , the only annoying part is when you get up to the till and have to have a re - scan !
negative	went back to k & co , and complained . they said they would ' sort it out ', and asked ' when ' we would like it delivered . we said " anytime after 00am , any day of the week " . it turned_up , a couple of days_later , @ 00 . 00 !
neutral	unfortunately although every item was fresh , the main flowers , roses were actually dead on arrival !!
negative	after a continued exchange of words for some 00_minutes in the store with first the assistant and then the manager no one was prepared to help me .
neutral	when the coat arrived it was way to small for me and was no where near what it said it would be .
positive	prices are cheap and delivery is fast .
neutral	i was interested in buying a garden_bench ( norfolk , racing green , circa_£_000 from memory ).
negative	consignment_number is zwassr000000 if anybody with a tiny_bit of remnant professionalism wishes to look into this whole mess !

positive	i am now the proud_owner of a gibson_les_paul swamp ash thanks to this store :)
negative	i thought this was fantastic as a sky sport customer and sports fanatic .
negative	the customer service obviously don_'_t know the meaning of the words " customer service "
neutral	when i spoke to people on the telephone they were always polite and helpful , but often said they would call back with an update , and didn_'_t do so .
neutral	this - and two optional charges - are not shown until the payment page .
neutral	we had to cancel the policy and get a refund .
neutral	future_bookings but was unable to do so .
positive	postage is fast and packaging is perfect .
negative	if you dare take out a contract with talktalk and there are any_problems - you are on a one way ticket to stressville , and talktalk won_'_t give a jot .
neutral	one ( large box with folding lid ) was so badly broken it can '_t be used , and the damage obviously occurred as a result of a heavier item being dumped in the box on top of it .
positive	we wanted to create a photo booth ( in strips like the old photobooths you all crammed_into ) from all the photo '_s we had taken on our_wedding day , we wanted something that was hardwearing and didn_'_t damage the pages when opened , not only was it a great price it looked high_quality and creating it was easy and quick .
positive	will_definitely use again .
neutral	at first it did save a lot of money .
negative	information about delivery is incomplete or missing .
negative	anyway , i received an_email from a different person from groupon asking for my paypal transaction details so that they can locate the payment which i gave to them 0_days ago and still nothing heard back .

neutral	so what happened when we got the delivery details , dpd wanted to deliver on a tuesday .
negative	i run a plumbing business so im not happy with them and my customer is not happy with me .
positive	such an easy to navigate site .
negative	the slats that rang along the length of the table did not sit equally , the space between was different from one end to the other end , they were different_lengths .
neutral	easy transaction
negative	all communication is one way - they never contact to give any sort of update which is just infuriating .
negative	no comunication at all from firm .
positive	it was without a remote_control and this was the cheapest place to buy an official one from .
neutral	great offers , always great selection of products .
negative	then a few weeks_later , i was getting phone_calls from 0 network about 0 - 0 times a day , pestering me for money .
neutral	they have added various_departments lately , including clothing and sporting equipment .
neutral	i ordered on line having spotted the website whilst looking for the number of a local_florist .

negative	any other day of the week ok but sunday_night when all the supermarkets are closed .
neutral	have had really good experience with broadband support when needed but recently have found their prices increasing making them the most expensive of the popular providers rather_than the value provider they used to be .
positive	). absolutely my favourite site to go to for fashion .
neutral	i have not heard from them since and am now £_00 for recitfying a mistake they made in the first place .
negative	their call_centres are abroad and therefore explaining things is never easy , simply because the nuances of the problems are missed .
negative	0 days_later i had not received anything .
positive	the whole_process and experience is highly_recommended .
neutral	we were not happy about this . just telling us would have been helpful .
negative	even the low_cost supermarkets who are clear its price and not service don_'_t put anyone with such limited social skills loose on the public .
neutral	butlers in the buff were very good , i would consider hiring them for an event .
negative	i contacted the company - ticket id 00000 .
positive	will use again for price , ease of ordering , good website full of info , and good customer service , thanks
negative	every other website ( including my own ) flags up a message that you cannot select a service if it is not possible , or doesn_'_t let you select it in the first place , but not woolovers , they cheated me out of £ 0 . 00 delivery charge , which is tantamount to cheating their customers !
neutral	i struggled that they said 0 - 0 days and asked not to chase for 0_weeks !
positive	i had been to closer shops who were very helpful but only stocked a couple of makes .
negative	extremely disappointed with the in professionalism of the company .
positive	we had an incredibly good value holiday in the algarve .
neutral	i checked the details online and was about to book online .
negative	no calculations were shown , however , so i rang and challenged this .
neutral	the option to email key people after each update is good .

neutral	the drivers are a strong point .
positive	it cost me about £ 0 . 00 at the post_office ( a free service was available ) i sent it on the thursday and the money was in my account friday lunch_time !
positive	as soon as i received the email i placed the order and received it next_day !!
neutral	no one replied with what was happening - i only got an e_- mail ( basically the same one from the courier and the vendor ) at the beginning of the next_day saying that the part would be delivered that day .
neutral	no lifts in the hotel , so carrying_heavy_suitcases up stairs to go back down stairs to our room was a bit unusual !
negative	we also wanted broadband which , for the many , is indispensable .
negative	i decided to leave and bought a car elsewhere .
positive	next_day delivery no_probs at all .
negative	absolutely useless .
negative	will stick with inter_flora in future

positive	you put all other_companies to shame .
negative	when i emailed photos of the roses as instructed to do , i received an email back informing_me these petals were " guard petals " and to remove them .
neutral	i think because of the lack of trust in their own deliverers isn_'_t that what they ' re saying ( we don_'_t trust u enough to really leave the package u only said u did ) so perhaps it '_s time uk followed the american way . large metal boxes for post of all_kinds .
positive	having used auto_europe for several_years for hire from munich airport i can_honestly_say they are a great company to deal with .
neutral	they replied immediately , to their credit , to explain the use of parabens and offered a refund etc ,, etc_., otherwise i have been very satisfied with their service .
negative	however i booked three tickets on friday_afternoon , and by my own mistake , i admit , i booked the ticket journeys the wrong way round !
neutral	after communication with pinesolutions i was eventually told by a manager it was my fault as they had not put the full address on parcel

negative	i agreed that that sounded fine and waited for my e_- mail with the cleaners details .
neutral	i turned down this offer flat as it was not adequate recompense for all the inconvenience and stress suffered when we had committed to spend £ 0 , 000 with your company .
neutral	consequently it takes a lot of phone_calls , half the day and wasted time to sort this out .
negative	!
positive	ordered some moisturiser and night serum on 00th_feb , received it on 00st , can '_t fault the service and the quality of goods .

negative	i dread teatime and prefer hospital food .
neutral	just a shame they were all drooping .
positive	great service .
neutral	0 .

negative	we are so angry about this we will take it up with customer_services and complaints_dept tomorrow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

neutral	so spent £_000 . 00
positive	i would definitely use this company again .
negative	i agree that my email is my responsibility which is why i had emailed them to tell them i hadn_'_t heard_anything from them and asked what was going on with my account - this email was sent to them within the 0_days they were supposed to wait for me to accept or decline the offer so they basically knew i hadn_'_t received the email but continued to process it anyway ?

neutral	the music in the lounge was great and really_cheered us up , the food in the 0 seas buffet although very very expensive was very good . the prices in other areas seemed very expensive also , 00_euros for a pizza sounds_like a mistake but that was the price !
neutral	on the plus_side it looks great and ( if it was not damaged ) good value for money .
positive	very good indeed - i bought 0 chests of drawers - beautifully made , proportioned and designed .
positive	just one suggestion : as a single working person , i am never at home to receive the parcel and so have to make time to trek_across to the po sorting_office which is a pain .
neutral	i purchased my products and then a day or 0 later beautybay had a sale on exactly those products so i was a little disappointed .

neutral	the shop is great but this mail order is bettered by wiggle etc .
positive	the choice of gear on deep_blue dive is overwhelming but i went for a package that will last me 00 years or more .
negative	atrocious customer service & incompetence .
neutral	the prices are not the cheapest and some stores give the delivery fee '_s after a certain amoun '_t and i '_ve exceded that amount in bouth the orders that i made , so i think that good coustemers should have a incentive to come_back .
negative	so , we think – the roof and the floor must be the same material .
neutral	they look good and fit well but i have , as yet , not had a chance to try them in water .
positive	for these i '_ve worked on my slides and with the

negative	around 0 : 00 yesterday evening when i had not seen a cancellation confirmation i emailed them , to which no reply !

positive	i wanted simple but classy invites and thats what i got .
positive	i tend to go for the cheapest price but the parcel is still delivered in a few_days .
positive	excellent service .
negative	first time i have ordered from argento , it was to be a gift for my sons_girlfriend .
negative	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
neutral	installation was slightly careless in terms of pipes being fixed to the wall in a messy way and no touch - ups done where the paint was unnecessarily stripped from the wall .
neutral	she was extremely rude and most_unhelpful and i found it unacceptable to have listen to the ' f ' word being used repeatedly whilst moaning to other staff about her job .
neutral	it takes months to go through , but then if it gets to 0_months , you lose it !
negative	i placed an order on 00 / 00 / 00 of a cotton candy 00cm plastic dog bed as it seemed a bargain , and my dog desperately needs a new bed .

negative	asked to send pics of it . then asked to return them - postage would be refunded if it '_s a bonafide problem .
neutral	easy to get in touch , very reasonable_prices but it takes a while to receive the prescription_medication as they are not stored on premises .
negative	all there reports are just to stir up trouble and cause unrest , to give them something to report on i suppose .

positive	fantastic , just the reassurance i needed .
neutral	m yparcel still_hasn_'_t arrived and i am concerned we will not get it for christmas .

neutral	unfortunately the phone - call cost me about half a days rental equivalent in cash .
neutral	i made sure it was nearer £_00 . 00 , but when i came to the checkout , it was charing me postage .
positive	congratulations blinds_0go , you deserve to be successful .
negative	after phoning inghams again today to querey this , they simply told me that their terms and conditions state that ba prices might change .
neutral	i then got another email the next_day saying it would be delivered that day and was given my hour_slot .

positive	thanks

negative	got to be better_than esure , as they don_'_t even give a s *** that i have left after 0 years with them !
negative	then horror upon horror when we got there we were on the send last row of the 0rd tier and our view was so restricted because of a stupid design fault at the arena as the ceiling_lights stopped us seeing the whole stage and especially the screen at the back of the stage and it really spoilt the show .

neutral	too keen to get my money than really explain this could happen .
negative	i therefore did the same on return .
positive	ordered mid week and parcel was delivered saturday_morning
negative	that was 0_days ago .
neutral	that is if you can find a magnifying_glass to read the instructions that come with it .
neutral	if someone as big as amazon can ship within_00hrs , i think a lesson could be learnt .
neutral	i also find it odd that your terms and conditions require a account to be created and will be adding any items you send into my spam_folder .
neutral	luckily i did because my bags were not collected on the day i was expecting them to be collected .
negative	i can only think that the couple of positive_reviews are written by themselves .

positive	the website is very intuitive with a great search_engine that is simple to use .
negative	conscious that their call_centre closed at 0 i called again .
neutral	just a shame that there is 0 long scratch right across the front .
positive	the hifiheadphone website was simply the most informative and clear headphone review and advice site i found after much research - i reccommend this shop without_hesitation .

neutral	it happens !
neutral	given i was staying only because i had an early flight , taking the car then was not an option .

positive	would use again and recommend without_reservation
neutral	my wellies arrived quickly and they are lovely , but the box was quite squashed and damaged .
neutral	the box is far too_big and full of unecessary paper .
negative	i am the one still_waiting for the remainder of the brushes and they have had full payment for all that time .
positive	i canceled and ordered with broadband_buyer and was stunned when i received shipping and dispatch notes just 00_minutes after_placing my order !
negative	anyway the money was immediately taken from my account , and i recieved an_email_saying my order was being_processed and waiting to be despached .
neutral	put in all my details , booked my preferred slot .
negative	i lost all confidence in them and wont be ordering again .
negative	they didn_'_t even reply to my e_- mail when i considered legal_action ( advised by my solicitor friend ).

negative	they have terrible customer service and if you do a quick google_search you will find out that the goods are shipped into the uk as " gifts " and no import_tax is paid .
positive	i was very pleased with my order of thank_you cards with photos .
neutral	unfortunately there was a queue of people waiting to go through the insurance sales routine in front of me and each one took 00_minutes so with just one person on the desk , it was an_hour before i could drop_off the papers .
negative	this time i didn_'_t get the usual photo email / mms to say it had been dispatched and the game didn_'_t arrive within the usual day or two .
neutral	i also sent an_email asking a question about usage and still , to date have had no response .
positive	i shopped_around and found gak to be the cheapest on - line price .

negative	i was left without an important present .
positive	have to buy more .
negative	words fail me as to how bad this parcel delivery company are .
negative	surprise_surprise no reply at all .
neutral	only difficulty was when i havd to print all the paper_work and tickets etc , they was really confusing to read and understand what i needed tpo take with me .
negative	i had not heard from her so contacted her to see if she had received them on the monday and she had not .
neutral	lenses ordered on sunday evenings normally arrive on tuesdays - that '_s what the website advised .
negative	i suspect they only fully refunded to try and not get bad feedback , but john_lewis they ain '_t .
negative	when i talked to the driver he admitted that it was his fault since he didn_'_t call me when he can '_t enter the main door for my apartment and he just left .
positive	based on the service i was offered i would recommend this company to anyone .
negative	unbelievable shower who i will never use again
positive	at every_step of the order i received either a text or email and this left me in no_doubt that the order was being fulfilled .
negative	the jacket i received on the friday was completely the wrong jacket ( a woman '_s , small jacket - i am a man ).
negative	now to honest they are great for mot testing , but my car failed and the garage quoted me £_000 to replace a coil spring , not clued on this sort of thing but thankfully i said need to speak to the other half first , got home and phoned an other garage who quoted me £_00 for the same work , sadly this is not the first time they quoted stupid prices , quoted my wife for repair work , and it was not even the problem , which would mean paying twice .
positive	dave bertin
negative	after trying all day to get_hold of someone finally they refused to help saying they couldnt offer a refund and if the flowers still didnt turn_up they would resend them .
neutral	had confirmed delivery date however this did not happen .

neutral	i said it was astupid place to put it and it needed an upfront warning or even refuse to allow paypal payment if you wanted a non - home address .
negative	after waiting in a full two_days for item to be collected i cancelled and got my money back .
positive	so easy and less queues dropping_off than at post_office .
neutral	the boots when they arrived were in excellent condition
neutral	can '_t fault the service i got tho .
positive	ordering the wetsuit top was easy and good value , and the product was delivered within 0 days , whcih was great
neutral	it took 0 - 0 mins to load each page during checkout .
neutral	one the strength of one short phone_call i can '_t say much - the guy was pleasant and polite .
negative	unbelievable !
negative	!
positive	best of all the sign is perfect .
positive	i originally ordered the ripstik through amazon which showed immediate availability .
positive	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
neutral	all together my experience was very stressful and i probably wouldn_'_t use them again .
neutral	i ordered 00 thank_you cards , printed on premium paper .
neutral	refund not yet made .?( 00 / 0 / 00 ).
negative	on his return call he confirmed i could return the tv box and router , there would be no charge and he would arrange a return delivery bag .
negative	will not be using company again .
neutral	that day i received the confirmation phone_call , only to be told that this time only the afternoon fitting was available .
neutral	an_apology and saying you '_ll get back to someone , then getting back even if it is to say i know nothing yet , keeps your customers calm and happy .
negative	yet after getting a phone_call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
negative	i will now purchase something from elsewhere and then return your defective item as apair as requested .
positive	it was very satisfying to receive such a well prepared for transportation parcel , care in the way it was packed was noted , thanks !
negative	sent off my perfect_condition i phone 0s and surprise_surprise it has triggered water_damage ?????
positive	it was well_packed and labelled fragile so even the outer omega box wasn_'_t damaged .
positive	thank_you worktop_express .
positive	i have used jessops_photo_book download service 0 times .
neutral	the products are probably cheaper because they have a short_shelf_life , there is nothing wrong with the product but be careful if you are stocking up on an item .
negative	i told customer_services i am trying to save_money , not add it , and it should be against the law for them to change my policy after i had agreed to it but its in the small_print , they can do as they want once you sign up with them , a bit like the mobile_phone companies changing your fixed rate monthly_contract !
neutral	i am a female , and although it was quite large , it was easy to lift and move , so her attitude was very bad .
neutral	0_stars !!!
positive	!
neutral	not the end of the world but don_'_t want it to happen again .
neutral	couldn_'_t find these cheaper anywhere_else but waited a week for shipping then had to contact them to see where they were .

neutral	i phoned aol to set_up a new phone line and broadband at my new home because i am moving , and they switched me over to talktalk .
positive	very pleased with product and price .
positive	after looking in shops and various other internet sites i always come_back to cheapsmells as their prices are the most competitive
positive	easy purchase system and excellent communication
negative	dreadful call_centre wait times - held on for 00_minutes today ( after the initial message said wait times were around 00 min ).
neutral	we upgraded again at check in , once we had paid we were told the cabin had gone but they were unable to refund our card .
negative	these are a bunch of clowns with no idea about prompt reliable customer service or how to perform internet / mail order retail successfully .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending viovet , and will certainly use their services again .
negative	it '_s been over two_weeks and i still_haven_'_t received my order .
positive	.
neutral	i '_ve sought a refund on this .
neutral	update > re - ordered material with expected availability in 0_weeks .
positive	i would certainly recommend krs if anyone asked me how to initiate equity_release .
neutral	it is simply not worth the hassle .
negative	the voucher refund has_been processed on the 00th of march back to payment_method and you should receive the same within 0 - 0 working_days .
positive	we are so pleased with our purchase !
neutral	out of the last handful of orders i would say 00_% of them have been wrong , missing discs , wrong films , not as advertised ect . ect . customer service is pretty quick to rectify but when you wait about 00 days for an item which is wrong , not worth the hassle !!
positive	i will be using your blooming beautiful services again , thank_you
negative	i was originally impressed with the ease of ordering and the time schedule - but what pity one turned_up on the appointed day to install my new telephone line and broadband .
negative	i cannot even begin to remind myself of the terror of that journey .
positive	the lensstore allowed me to get a very accurate prescription , not just some standard sizes .
negative	i have requested my file so that i can lodge it with ofcom .
neutral	ordered on the 00th_jan and paid for delivery within 0 working_days , allowed for friday 00th , monday 00th and thought tuesday 00th would be 0rd working day ( as stated ' within ' 0 working_days ) but delivery still not made .
neutral	this is a real problem .
positive	elegant website .
neutral	i just hope that i get a long service from what i consider to be a quality brand of tools ( metabo )
neutral	ok but no need for the hassle .
neutral	tip_: know what you ' re buying .!
negative	i phoned customer '_s service and the lack of understanding or sympathy for our plight was astounding !
neutral	shame as this after sales experience spoilt the swift despatch and delivery of the item .
negative	the driver had unlocked my back gate and left my parcel .
negative	unfortunately , i '_m going to have to find another_supplier which is a shame because they used to be so good .
positive	a trusted_seller
positive	overall an easy shopping_experience , would shop_here again .

positive	had no_problems , flight times good , villa good but starting to need a lick of paint but we had a good time .
negative	and guess_what there hayes store is now a cost you lots cafe .
positive	delivered as promised .
neutral	probably cost me five times as much money to buy the goods online through havens as it would through a local shop .
positive	the product range looks good and i '_ve already_recommended the company to others .
neutral	i was surprised but attached it to an e_- mail on the same day .
neutral	all in all the roses were nice but the delivery time not good !!!
neutral	the costume is poorly made for regular use and after inially being really happy with the website , the process , delivery and price i '_m now disappointed the costume is falling_apart .
neutral	i found a card in the letterbox with a number to call which was not in use , i then via the internet found a mobile number rang it left a message and no response .
negative	lakeland unable to re deliver parts before christmas so total_waste of time for me and no spare seats for christmas , wish i had ordered from a company that actually checked what they pack .
negative	i can '_t even rate them
neutral	i was a bit disappointed and would think_twice before i use this company again .

neutral	re - delivery date cannot be stated but at_least 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	i '_m hoping that another will be dispatched or it will finally arrive !
neutral	would be better to book delivery and have the option to book collection at the same time . and , preferably , that these bookings are met
neutral	your booking form does not explain this very clearly .
positive	will definitely be shopping with partyrama in the future : 0 )
negative	boots contacted hermes on 00th_jan_0000 telling them to return the item back to them .
positive	they give a excellent service even when i gave them a incorrect
negative	when i reordered the plant went to a different address than on the form .
positive	contacted cleverboxes tp obtain a price for a sony hdr - tg0ve camcorder .
negative	i enquired whether it was not normal practice for them to tell me about this , save us waiting for our food and they said they usually do but this one seemed to just slip through the net !
negative	you have also failed to address the fact that the you emailed me the article had been dispatched on the 0rd of january and then a follow_up email on the 0th to say an error had been made and it had not been sent and was again out of stock .
positive	i order the dap diffuser from animed after much internet research .
negative	wasn_'_t chasing the order but some 0 days after i received an email asking about there service i emailed them saying hard to review when order has not arrived .
negative	i stayed on hold for 00_minutes then hung_up .
neutral	these were identical and need a private_prescription .
negative	as an individual and on behalf of 0 gp surgeries i have purchased ‘ 000 ’_s of pounds worth of goods from you over the past years .
neutral	ffx 0_stars
positive	i rang my local supplier , who must have been at_least 00_% more_expensive , even including the postage_charges , so opted to order from shower_doctor .
neutral	+ customer service seemed to be very good .
positive	what more could i hope for .
neutral	i found the service the easiest and quickest of several other similar_websites .
neutral	wouldn_'_t stop me shopping with them in the future though as customer service was very helpful .
negative	in my case , my parcel was left with somebody down the other end of my street ( who i had never met in my life ) who denied all knowledge of it .
neutral	she said it was in the ts_&_cs .
positive	excellent packaging , speedy delivery and great value for money .
positive	i found the service very good , the guy knew a bit about the tyres and the fitting arrangements with car care in tetbury went very smoothly .
negative	the reply was i don_’_t know .
negative	i work out the cost of what i '_m buying including the cashback so when it is declined i feel particularly ripped_off .
neutral	programs are really poor now far to many repeats and programs are repeated far to quickly , some are tarted up to look different total crap
neutral	especially the non perishable parts
negative	i received two dispatched texts at midday , then nothing more .
neutral	this is supposed to be fresh_meat .
neutral	yes it does the job yes the car was clear with nothing to report but at a cost of £_00 for nothing to report i think is expensive .
positive	at 00 : 00 the next_morning dpd delivered the goods , all were excellent and have reassured me with being_able to defend my property from flooding .
negative	not as cheap as parcels to go , in addition , if you have a have a problem they walk all over you .

neutral	i placed my order on 0th_june and received an acknowledgement .
neutral	other than that , ok .
positive	great service which i will_definitely use again !
neutral	all was going well until we got to the roof .
negative	cdkeys . com : order approval 00000000000
positive	have used chemistdirect several_times & have always had an excellent , quick delivery .
neutral	i was therefore disappointed with the final service received from rentify , especially given that i '_d paid for the additional service / complete package .
neutral	did not pay full price for all phones .
negative	i got the impression that the call_centre guy thought i was making a fuss about nothing so had no great expectations !
neutral	top quality produce time and time again .
neutral	two failed deliveries .
neutral	however received the mobile phone the following_day well before the deadline hour given .
negative	when you find you can only download at 000kb / s ( likely due to network congestion from the aforementioned lack of bandwidth for the entire icuk network or as a result of traffic shaping implemented to compensate the lack of bandwidth ), your only means of resolution is to fire off an email to their support_team which will go_unanswered until the following_day .
positive	an excellent service all_round and i would certainly use them again and on top of that i saved over £_00 .
negative	it then took 00_mins to contact them later as phone no provided was not available .
positive	i will also be recommending this site to others .
negative	needless to say it was impossible to contact anyone at ryanair .
negative	!
positive	prompt delivery very helpful service .
positive	i love buying books for pennys .
negative	they state on their website the calling time " average pick_up 0 minutes " then you ring and find you can be on there for up to 00_minutes before being answered .
negative	better to buy in a good shop with good customer service .
negative	we use your service the whole time and as usual we trusted you to provide the goods next_day .
positive	i was very pleased with the products and will definitely use this company again .
negative	i told the woman i spoke to about 00 times that i couldn_'_t book but she continued to ask me for my booking_reference , i then asked to be put through to a manager , was put through to customer_services who i couldn_'_t hear properly , then they put me on hold straight_away .
negative	flowers delivered on wednesday dropped by friday the same week .
negative	the trader i bought from has_been informed of this failure and is very unhappy .
positive	no_complaints , kept in touch with delivery dates .
positive	it '_s also awesome that they have a lot of free or discounted offers when you go to check out !!
positive	what i really like about lenstore is the re - order service , virtually one click and my lenses are winging their way to me .
neutral	however , the speed of delivery was good and it suited the purpose in the end .
negative	very disappointed , wish i had of read the reviews before placing an order .
neutral	the returns process is reasonably straightforward although it is not compliant with the uk '_s law on direct selling - you will be out of pocket on a return ( which you should not be ) unless you fight for your money .
neutral	not impressed .
positive	i have been buying from them for at_least 00 years , regularly buy fish_oils and other products .
negative	they said they hadn_'_t because they only had lenses to make up one pair and were waiting for lenses they had ordered for the second pair .
negative	the kitchen is finally finished but still no word re our money but then we didn_'_t think there would be .
positive	further , the pricing was extremely competitive , comparable to any of the premium sites that i have used in the past .
negative	oh , they said that they understood my concern ( standard reply content ) and they would look for a solution ( standard reply content ).
negative	the initial arrival at the parking lot was ok and the lift to the airport was fine .
positive	it was so easy to order , and very fast delivery , i will_definately be ordering from them again .
negative	he left a scribble of a number on the card - so had to guess most of the number , he didn_'_t have much to say when he was proven to be a liar and that he hadn_'_t even attempted to come and deliver .
negative	let '_s see if my account is refunded in quote : 0 - 0 working_days from 00th of march .
negative	i ordered a bouquet , chocolates and a balloon for my mum .
neutral	it was a pain but looking into it , unfortunately it '_s not unusual for deliveries by this company , it seems that a lot of people have problems with deliveries not arriving on huge specified date .
positive	go on , talk to your kids !
neutral	i utgangspunktet problemfritt .
positive	excellent communications .
positive	i ordered 0 gifts yesterday , and received them today .
neutral	hi , i love the flowers from prestige but found the website frustrating and not very helpful .
neutral	however , the delivery men were reluctant to take the items ( flat_pack bedroom_furniture ) to the top floor bedroom .
positive	did have some doubts . was it too good to be true ?
negative	i pointed_out the obvious that you had a driver for the broken down vehicle .
neutral	a good company but the computer says no !
positive	highly_recommend this company .
positive	if you want a blind you def need this company .
neutral	free delivery good too . but don_'_t put 00 / 00 hr delivery when in actually takes 0 / 0 days .
positive	will buy from again !
neutral	my usual trusted company didn_'_t offer this service which is why i looked for a different company and found clare_florist .
negative	they mandate a contact method when you reschedule , so not having our info is no excuse .
negative	further they keep on sending us bills we should pay for we have not ordered .
positive	in addition to this their customer service is fab .
neutral	the only catch is that the software crashes quite_often , meaning you have to keep re - loading it and sometimes i '_ve lost work that way .
neutral	i will be more specific next time .
negative	but they don_'_t .
positive	the gift_wrapping option is lovely .
positive	i am so pleased with the result that i am already creating my next project !
neutral	!
neutral	always used to use expedia and still do but have been finding
neutral	overall not very impressed .
neutral	spent £_000 . 00 on a brand_new casio_g_shock which arrived in december .
neutral	went alright in the end .
negative	in short i can_honestly_say they have provided the worst experience and customer service in my entire history of ordering online .
positive	went to oakfurnitureland and bought a set of drawers they were wonderful so helpful i have been to germany and bought my wooden furniture there but will definitely be going back to oak_furniture .
negative	it gets registered every time i phone , but it has still not been corrected .
positive	i am extremely happy with the service provided by this company .
neutral	as for phone service , i '_ve never had any_problems_whatsoever .
negative	0 .
negative	i ' d spoken to them on 0 occasions chasing it and they never mentioned anything_else wrong with the phone and were clearly incorrect .
neutral	the box was all mangled and the bottom on the bike was all scratched
neutral	when i placed my order i was told my watch was a special order though and therefore wasn_'_t eligible .
neutral	ordered a mobile_phone case and although the communication was good , the item never arrived .
positive	dress itself with headband and choker were good but i gave the ' boots ' a miss !
positive	transferwise is a really handy way to avoid paying too much for international transfers .
neutral	the tail is completely fabric made with elastic armbands to secure it .
positive	ordered december 00 and they arrived nye as promised .
neutral	also acknowledged .
positive	the quality of the goods were also of a good standard .
positive	just a small thing but this ment so much to all the group after the last few hours .

negative	i placed my order 0_weeks before mother '_s day .
negative	i rang up and all they had to say was that ' they must have got lost ' awesome customer service !

neutral	i already complained about this in an_email .
negative	dpd find it and deliver it to me tomorrow or they don_'_t find it and you send out a replacement tomorrow .
positive	i have never been disappointed with chocolates now and i ahve been using them for some 00 years .
neutral	this is not what the web_site says and is a matter for trading_standards to now sort_out .
neutral	i guess i '_ll never find out for sure .
positive	that is excellent all_round service .
negative	i have been a customer of myprotein for many_years supporting them when they were a small , dedicated and simple operation .
negative	they need to make the facts that they ' re hong_kong based and that you '_ll be hit with considerable taxes much more obvious on their site .
neutral	i bought this as a surprise for my son and have to admit that although some of the pictures were very good in colouring , others were not .
positive	totally reliable , confirmed order promptly and delivered to my requirements which is unusual .
neutral	the directions to the drop_off point were awful - it said go to departures - and there were no signs whatsoever for departures so we drove right through the airport .
negative	i contacted_iflorist and they said i had only made one order and i should put in another order .
neutral	bought a oliver burton watch should of included some free earings that i did not receive but watch looks classey
negative	luckily , others were there who had also been told to meet the same seller here to receive their tickets so we tried to contact the man who had arranged to meet us .
negative	received a broken light and we asked for replacement
positive	a very happy customer .
negative	i had contacted them but they would do nothing on my say - so , wanted to hear from an ill 00 year - old .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	very poor service in that it appears that your right hand did not know what your left hand was doing and you committed the cardinal sin of lying to a customer .
negative	in the past i '_ve called up to oint this out and have been told that the next time i make an order , the money for the missing record ( s ) will be deducted from my bill , but this has never happened .
positive	banglads offers great value with lots of offers .
neutral	also i ' d like to see more japanese cars at the inventory .
negative	our customer service team will contact you as soon as it is completed .
neutral	had a hiccup when i booked the 0nd time that the driver never turned_up .
negative	never again .
negative	an_email was sent to advise of my concern .
negative	this severely annoyed me .
negative	@ webuy take your money quickly . com
negative	i may bill them for the £_00 voucher plus the 0 hours of my time , all wasted !
negative	and stay_away from kitchen italia !!!
negative	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
positive	they do exactly as they say they will do , better prices than another distributor i deal with and a wider_range .
positive	excellent communications_throughout and delivery from germany way ahead of expectations .
positive	outdoor & country store is where they were purchased you should try it .
neutral	the ordering_process was fine - except it didn_'_t like me changing the address to direct the delivery to my wife '_s specific office .
neutral	deal was good value with a weeks carparking at airport .
neutral	as a family of three , however , we were less enthralled to receive 0kg of chicken in one pack .!
positive	i must commend the service .
negative	customer service is dire , emails aren_'_t answered , phone_calls are pretty_pointless !
neutral	i would much rather have taken the vehicle full and returned the car full of fuel ( as most uk car_rentals operate ) having sourced my own replacement fuel at the lower costs .
positive	my fiance and i picked my engagement_ring from dg after visiting a lot of shops and not having any luck or finding anything we really liked .
positive	they even a pre payed envolope ,, where as some of the others expect you to pay and send your self ,,, high recomend no cons all pros 0_stars all the way xx

negative	heres why greed !!!
positive	if only this was the case with every company !
positive	it was delivered in less_than 0 minutes and saved me about £ 0 compared to buying it in tesco !
neutral	contacted customer_care who said they couldn_'_t source any new cord , sorry for the inconvenience .
positive	recommend you view the site .
positive	i also noticed that they had a 00_%_off code for halloween .
positive	quick delivery
neutral	major_issue is that you can '_t book collection until the boxes are delivered .
positive	amazingly i ordered the iron on thursday and in my inbox on monday was a delivery slot of one hour later that day .
positive	00000 / 000000 / 00 ).
neutral	it '_s not very hygienic and i don_'_t even know if any has fallen out .
neutral	the 00 mg tablet was not strong_enough
positive	i was very impressed with the speed and quality of service , so much in fact that i have recommended fonebank to my son to use .
neutral	product is great .
negative	my order was paid for , for express delivery and according to yodels website , was due to be delivered on 00 . 0 . 00 .
positive	ask then to write down the color clarity cut and carat then go home and look for a similar or better stone on quality diamonds .
neutral	unfortunately , it does not appear that the distributors have any idea of maintaining the good service delivered by the customer face of the company .
negative	it took 0 messages for them to finally admit their mistake and each time they simply ' stone - walled ' me with assertions that the order was in processing so there was nothing they could do .
neutral	i was also disappointed that pet_prescription started to charge postage & packing , i don_'_t think they are as competitively_priced as they used to be .
neutral	this system needs a thorough overhaul , it is very frustrating and , i am sure , must lead some people to give up completely .
neutral	not any higher_than 0_stars because when it came to paying out there are a number of administrative obstacles to overcome - i ' d say they use some sort of breakage model to retain the commission longer_than is necessary .
neutral	still nothing .
neutral	really good quality clothes but rubbish customer service .
negative	and they , of course , took full payment up front .
negative	all promises and no action .
positive	the delivery was rapid .
neutral	at stonehenge there was time to walk around and view .
neutral	why do i have to type in the county ?
positive	simples !
neutral	don_’_t think so !
neutral	hi
negative	received the shoes , didn_'_t fit .
positive	they really care about giving you what is best for you .
positive	the brooklands suite itself provided good facilities and was a great place to watch the race from with the food , drink & hosting all being first_class .
negative	upon phoning customer_services they confirmed a medium had been sent but no apology given !
positive	to make_sure i was ordering the correct item i e_- mailed offtek & within_00hrs had received a full explanation of what was required & not only that , a direct link to the item page which made things much_easier .
positive	shame there wasn_'_t a wider_range of sizes on offer , although this is all clearly set out on the web_site , because we would have bought another pair !
negative	absolutely abysmal service , communication and overall experience .
neutral	such a shame .
positive	fast delivery
negative	i cancelled the lesson as i was disappointed with there poor service & asked for a refund i was told it would take seven working_days for a full_refund to be paid back in to my account , after seven day '_s i had still not received a refund i contacted bsm again to inform them about this when they assured me that a refund would be made right away only i was still_waiting for a refund seven_days after that .
positive	i ordered 0 scales for our warehouse as our set had stopped_working .
positive	the main problem is there was no way ( in my jodel dr0000 ) that i could position the kneepad so i could use all its and the ipad '_s functionality .
negative	today arrives and i thought it best to check with orange at about 00 . 00 .
neutral	but when it arrived it was a 00ml_bottle of blue statos cost £ 0 . 00
negative	they took my money , didn_'_t email or contact me in any manner to confirm my booking and didn_'_t deliver the product i '_d ordered either .
negative	this is the email they sent me
neutral	i was looking at roller_blind fabrics but was also sent 0 samples of venetian_blind selections as well ?!
negative	i happened to telephone father who was in some distress over the incident and the threat of further_action_against him embodied in the text of the chit .
neutral	however , the rub was advertised as costing 0 . 00 !
positive	the site was great and the process was easy from_start to finish .
positive	i found this company online and decided to test them with a request for an iphone back cover .
positive	i would recommend and use them again .
negative	i bought a pair of shoes at a remarkable discount .
positive	god product , well_packaged and arrived very quickly .
negative	also screws where missing and no instructions for some of the items .
neutral	steve maybury was the fitter and i am very happy with the end product .
neutral	the bunch did seem a bit sparse .
positive	it was high in the safety ratings and also has a recline feature .
neutral	as for the mattress / bed - i must_admit i am disappointed .
positive	any_queries_answered quickly and knowledgeably - great deals with all offers honoured and many savings made .
positive	have ordered lots of photos from this company and have never had a problem .
positive	quality tools at good prices , if they have nt got it you don t need it .
neutral	running on a space_saver at the moment .
positive	would recommend this company .
positive	this is the first time iv used this site but il now be a regular customer .
negative	this is appalling as i ordered deal straight_away , paid , to then be told you cannot receive another is horrendous when i didn_'_t receive even the damaged item in the 0st place !
neutral	shambolic situation at 0st dinner sitting when no - one knew where to sit .
neutral	finding , selecting and ordering easy .
negative	the woolovers website allows you to do this and you get charged full wack despite the fact that next_day service is not possible on a friday for a saturday delivery ( why ??).
positive	while_browsing the internet i came_across mytuxedo and was really impressed with the range of formal_wear .
neutral	the confirmation quoted them as happy birthday balloons when i obviously wanted get well ones .
negative	0 minutes later my lasagne was returned , nuked to an inch of it '_s life and my girlfriends macaroni and cheese minus the raw bacon .
neutral	i wanted to test their service for that initial 00 days and then if i was happy , take out a new contract .
negative	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .
positive	ordering was simple , they let you know when delivery will take place - you get to choose if you want - they came back with options for earlier dates , called to agree what worked !
positive	it was a no_brainer really .
neutral	got no thanks for that , no reduction on cost , the panel under dashboard was not refitted correctly and got left with a fault light on dashboard which i had to pay another garage to clear .

neutral	i am pleased to say i recieved the synth early_afternoon so in that respect a happy customer . so whats my point .
negative	first of all i decided to price match as i found they sell the glasses i want for £_00 less on amazon .
neutral	alternatively look into buying a sunpass at a supermarket ( eg publix ) and load it up with $_00 as and when .
negative	when we arrived at the airport , we had a car but no car_seat ( the car_hire company showed me the booking from rentalcars to them , and there was no request for a car_seat ), so i could not legally drive with my grandson .

positive	i was kept_updated and was met by my driver at the time and place specified .
negative	rip_off .
neutral	overpriced , not very well made and easy to break when you refil , not like a real_cigarette , i am going to try patches next !
negative	pissedconsumer . com is on a par with some seedy sex sites , or other such highly obnoxious internet experiences .
negative	), royal_mail refused recorded delivery ( due to the size of the parcel ), item was returned via_parcelforce ( and this cost 00 gbp ).
negative	i confirmed this , as i had a 0 year part warranty and they agreed that was the price .
negative	after 0_weeks i had to write again asking when they would be shipped .
positive	cheaper_than anywhere_else and arrived in 0 days
negative	one of the three people i spoke to at customer_services confirmed that they had received my email so i know this is not another suposed problem with email

positive	i ordered a pair of raybans and received them within 0 working_days on standard delivery which was great .
positive	good job very fast just what i wanted , no_fuss
neutral	might be an idea to stock up on the best sellers , i '_ve tried for replacement wicks batteries and melon magic all out of stock .
neutral	although this was resolved within a few_days , it was very inconvenient and frustrating .
neutral	the on - board service was terrible and they had no food left on the return_journey ; the stewards were badly trained and didn_'_t give a fig about anything , but it is a low_cost airline and they are one of the few carriers who fly directly to marrakesh .
neutral	they phoned my partner after 0pm on the monday to say it would be delivered on tuesday_morning - so even_though they were letting us know a time , he had still had to keep the whole day available as he didn_'_t find out about delivery until last_minute .
positive	she also went through the various different finance packages they could offer , including an interest free option , which is the one i chose but there were so many different options that were all really affordable , which surprised me , i should have looked in to it sooner , instead of assuming i couldn_'_t afford it .
neutral	it would allow me to put prints onto a page then shuffle them around into spaces that were not appropriate for the images used e . g it would put a landscape into a square place .
neutral	so i had to take time off work to collect the items in time for the stag_do .
positive	needed a new one for work / business / leisure that wouldn_'_t cost the earth .
neutral	wish they had kept me posted on the despatch / delivery .
negative	as i said , i did my best not to be rude , but understanding .
negative	not great !
positive	we bought full_stave oak_worktops and upstands and were very very happy with the quality .
neutral	i felt that paying to return the trousers was unfair as many other online shops its free returns and i felt urban_industry were partly_responsible for the trousers not being what i expected
neutral	so my question is why give me 0 keys if i can not keep them apart ?
neutral	i should have been able to do all of this within the one booking .
negative	.
negative	where is my parcel ?
negative	!.
negative	i was thus surprised when they deducted the postage from my refund .
positive	quick delivery , very good service @ quality
negative	when we placed an order the web_site failed to finalise the payment procedure so we tried a number of times again without_success .
neutral	if you are going to run a big discount month then please make_sure you have the stock to service it .
negative	i want to cut my contract with t - mobile as they don_'_t give you your moneys_worth .
neutral	the lady got her flowers and was pleased with them which was what was important at the end of the day

positive	sent my phone an got payment within two_days !
negative	i will not be purchasing from them again .
negative	attempted to buy deal , and was informed card was rejected and to re - check details , after doing so , card rejected again .
negative	in the end i have returned your glasses and have used a local_optician .
neutral	good customer service just never take out o0 insurance hard to find there number and impossible to make a claim
negative	they are untrustworthy and unreliable .
negative	this has happened on a few occasions and unlike e_- bay you can '_t leave_feedback .
negative	upon collection the next_day they box was all torn and bashed .
neutral	i feel that this time period is too short if the customers best_interests are in mind .
positive	very fast delivery well_packaged
positive	when i have needed to phone and speak to someone they are so helpful and efficient and really know their coffee !
neutral	not happy !!!
neutral	you don_'_t have to wait forever to get through to a human and they are always very chirpy and helpful .
neutral	did so , but no return call almost a week_later - have now missed the offer i wanted .
neutral	however at times the create vibrations sounds which defeats the objective of them .
neutral	delivery was speedy .
negative	i waited nearly an_hour , listening to the most annoying music , especially when the loop played the songs for a second and third time .
positive	excellent range of goggles to choose from at very good prices , web_site was easy to navigate and use , a painless purchase and very pleased indeed with the product , considering it was close to christmas when i ordered the delivery came on 00rd_dec

positive	i ordered a new lipstick to try using the halfpriceperfumes . co . uk site , it was so easy , all very simple to choose what you want , trusted website and the lipstick arrived very quickly , and by the way the lipstick is gorgeous .
negative	i needed to get 0 parcels to london by a definite date in early_december and chose to use collect_+ as the recipient was at work all day and it was far more convenient for him to pick the parcels up at a local shop after work than it was to try to get to the post_office during the opening_hours .
neutral	ok , but still doesn_'_t answer the question - why was my access removed in the first place .
negative	the milton_keynes shop said they would deliver the furniture and put it in any room we wanted but this is not the case for heavy items such as wardrobes , when they arrived with the oak_furniture they said they would have to arrange another delivery date for a 0 man team to carry the furniture .
neutral	well_done .
negative	it is now over a month since i ordered the product with ' fast delivery ' yet it still has not arrived and i have heard_nothing from customer_services as to why .
negative	i called a week_later and it went through to answerphone , i left a message and got a call back minutes later .
neutral	oh_dear , after only minimal use two of the zips on the case have broken .
positive	really well pleased with evert item .
neutral	no reply .

neutral	be careful !
neutral	i was told my dive_computer was coming on the tuesday so waited in all day , eventually at five thirty i rang and spoke to a staff_member , he then realised it was still i the shop , he assured me it would be sent the following_day .
negative	the bank will likely use it afterwards to pursue the fraudulent claim .
neutral	i '_m wondering_if they have new systems in place or new staff ?
negative	they employ most unprofessional and untrained staff who lack basic customer service skills .
negative	i got hacked almost_immediately and really isn_'_t there something better to be doing them announcing what mundane activity you ' re doing now .
positive	i got what i ordered , exactly when i ordered it for .
neutral	on the whole we thought the service provided was for their benefit rather_than the customer .
neutral	initially the price was around £_00 (£_000 total_cost ) more_expensive but with a cheaper and perhaps more appropriate paper the price came down to what i considered more acceptable .
negative	went back and left with a bigger problem than when i started .
positive	the whole_process was quick and easy .
neutral	i was told that this would incur an extra_charge as the removed wheels would need re - balancing .
positive	i ordered my product from nature '_s best online and was eligible for free delivery .
positive	very easy to use , everything is done online .
negative	they no_longer persue me for money that i do not owe them .

neutral	we received an initial set of email messages_confirming our requirements followed up by various vouchers or e_- tickets that sometimes were complete but mostly weren_'_t .
positive	thanks !
positive	the site is amazing at first i wanted a devil costume they never had my size they got in contact straight_away and showed me alternatives like the product i asked for !
neutral	i had chosen nominated day delivery which_meant that i was in all day on the day that i had chosen .
negative	it '_s not the end of december and i still have not had a refund .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled when they say they are from your service provider .
neutral	bit disappointed quite sparse arrangement .
positive	would definitely recommend using this company to anyone .
negative	how when they couldn_'_t find it the first time round ?
neutral	this has not been an issue with bondra before , i have always been happy .
positive	the guitar equipment market is flooded with high prices .
negative	today i found out the real reason is ups hadn_'_t even been booked as the package wasn_'_t scanned .
positive	i couldn_'_t find a ps0 anywhere on the high_st so ordered monday_night .
neutral	i am expecting them to fall_off any time now ( i got them on thursday_evening ).
positive	would def use agsin
negative	when i asked if this didn_'_t damage them , he said " often , yes ".
neutral	in fairness , they emailed me to say it would be delayed - and i decided to hang on .
negative	right ?".
neutral	also had to stand waiting for cooked items , including fried eggs , bacon , mushrooms and beans .
neutral	you need patience :-)

neutral	service and site very good and easy to use !!
negative	the key itself was broken which should have been an omen but on we went , enjoyed the test_drive even_though the car had no diesel in at all so we had to go back the next_day to adctually drive it , all we could do was look !
neutral	don_'_t force people away because of this .
neutral	time will tell if it is as good as it appears to be .
neutral	then and only then , will i be able to properly give an accurate star_rating of this company .
neutral	the part itself was fine , but i do resent paying delivery charges when you know it won_'_t be successfully delivered , and it would be much more convenient to pick it up yourself .
positive	i have been dealing_with priory for a few_years_now and have always received great products and excellent service .
negative	they broke their own contract , then they wanted me to pay for their cockup .
negative	at 0000 on the 00 / 00 / 00 after not having had a response from myukdelivery since 00 . 00 i emailed saying

positive	he was a great guy_who was a credit to the company .
positive	both drivers were very helpful and courteous an excellent company and would recommend them to anyone .
negative	will never use this company again and would recommend anyone_thinking of buying from them not to .
neutral	he also refused to carry the second box up the communal stairs to our flat - he told me it was a 0 man job , and as i am 0mths pregnant and had a toddler in the flat , obviously i couldn_'_t help .
neutral	to be honest i buy my strings and picks from you guys as i feel i get a good price , anything_else i buy is because other online stores are out of stock
positive	good , quick close to what virgin_media advertised anyway
neutral	superdry need to check up on their site safe drop_off addresses .

positive	thank_you for your help .
negative	last_year i joined a new company and i was ordering all supplies including stationairy .
neutral	after a few_months , these interruptions began to dwindle , and i only have to log in about once every three_months .
neutral	i guess if you were employing a plumber to fit then this may not be a problem but it required me to visit the local plumbing store a couple of times to get the required fitments at significant extra_cost .
negative	at 0 pm i have had a guts full and phone ups who promise me it '_s on it '_s way .
negative	contacting bt to report a fault is next to impossible and call_centre staff , although polite enough , are no help at all .

positive	i was kept_informed as my order progressed .

neutral	we have had better cabin_crew service from bmi and even ba to be honest .
neutral	it would have given me a lot more confidence in prestige_flowers if ; when you choose your bouquet and you are ready to order , the tick box for the boosted bouquet size wasn_'_t automatically ticked .
neutral	when the reorder date came round i wasn_'_t sent a reminder before hand and i got an_email at 00 . 00 on the due date .
negative	it was a next_day service so they picked_up and then delivered the next_day as expected .
neutral	so a mixed review here .
neutral	customer_services worked after my intial query but they would do better to be more proactive in letting peoiple know the status of their order .
neutral	i am very hard to please and have trialed many regular cleaners because i always think i could have donw better but this time , really , they exceeded my expectations .
positive	the car_seat when it came was high_quality and was dispatched very quickly .
negative	they have had at_least seven attempts to get our order right , but we are still 0 items away from a complete kitchen .

positive	the ship was kept very clean and tidy ( the crew were even washing the outside windows in all the wind and rain )!
neutral	this seems to me to be a bizarre arrangement but i duly ordered the tyre and returned to have it fitted .
negative	booked a photography_course , e_- mailed the company and left messages on their mobile , ałl of which was ignored .
negative	when they made the refund it was for the actual cost of the items minus the return postage .

positive	i rang drinkstuff to explain and was thrilled to be able to quickly speak to a caring human_being who quickly arranged for a replacement to be sent with minimal_fuss .
negative	flowers were awful , cheap , nothing like the picture and died within 0 days .
neutral	yodel pretended to deliver , gave invalid cards and returned item back to makro ( after i had complained to makro ).
negative	the first time they said when i eventually got to speak to them was that a part was missing but didn_'_t have the courtesy to phone me to tell me and my partner had taken a day off work to wait for the delivery .
neutral	however the delivery didn_'_t show up so after a telephone_conversation the next_morning i was assured that the problem was just the amount of xmas deliveries and that the delivery would be made that day .
negative	the supplier ebeez then charged my credit_card the full_amount for one vacuum_cleaner £_000 , even_though i had already paid for 0 at the discounted price through groupon .

neutral	i just thought it was a raucous colour - but in the circumstances certainly eye_catching - literally and metaphorically .
positive	we were away from the terminal within 00_minutes after collecting our baggage .
neutral	not great , seeing as this was bought as a wedding gift .
negative	both_times that i have ordered with misguided there have been problems with delivery .
neutral	no further hitches , dirty_dancing was great and so was cocktail_making !
neutral	i think you should be switching such a function on , if you wish to have it applied .
neutral	delivery at 0 o ' clock is not good enough unless i '_m told beforehand .
negative	order number : pl - pi0000000 [ 0000000 ]
positive	the laptop is now very wizzy !!

neutral	they were reluctant to use a dilute cleaning_solution i asked them to use to clean the room despite having cleared its use with eamonn on the previous visit and so wasted 0 of the 00_hours by not following instructions and having to clean the room all over again .
positive	excellent service all together .
positive	thank_you !
neutral	the next reply was in german , i think , but was no better .
neutral	was advised good were in stock and that i was ordering in time for delivery next_day .

positive	well_done all at ergonomic design .
neutral	i requested call_backs to explain where we were at , but 0 out of 00 times that never happened .
neutral	i would have continued with the order as it was 00_%_discount weekend .
neutral	however , their returns_policy_states the costumer has to pay for the postage which of course would be very expensive on a large rug .
positive	used parcel0go whilst trying to decide_whether to bid for an odd_shaped item on ebay - very inconveniently at the other end of the country .
neutral	support say it will be released in time to preload - not true ( unless you have insane (> 00mbps ) broadbnad ).
neutral	pros_:
neutral	the first delivery had a fault running through it
negative	goods delivered ok
neutral	the order confirmation said they were " in the dispatch process to be delivered shortly 0 - 0 working_days by courier " at point of order which was rather mis_- leading .
neutral	however , please have a word with your couriers and ask them to be gentle .
positive	i recommended this company to friends . family and neighbours . john was very helpful in sorting my order out . very good on price and delivered quickly .
negative	no apology , no nothing until after i complained !

negative	please can you explain this as a matter of urgency .
negative	they finally got in touch with me in january , and said i could have a refund for the undelivered items but not the damaged items ( unless i posted them back - they were food items and i threw them out after a couple of weeks as i didn_'_t fancy hanging on to mouldy food ).

positive	subject says it all really :)
neutral	post was rather slow and box was crushed when it arrived , although i was kept up to date with order process with emails .
neutral	i prefer the manned option as there '_s some peace of mind_knowing that it '_s staffed 00hrs a day .
neutral	the box was but the console wasnt .
neutral	the cds were in a jiffy_bag , then the mailers and jiffy were in a giant jiffy_bag , folded over and sealed in a plastic mailer bag .
negative	to cut a long and infuriating story_short , the mirror was only available as an add - on to the vanity_unit at a cost of £_000 .
neutral	thankfully the agent for new bookings was able to answer my very simple enquiry . but now i await an extortianate phone bill !!
negative	not only is the automated process of taking only the postcode from an address and giving that to a local_florist fundamentally flawed but the customer service was extremely poor showing no sign of understanding , empathy or service ( aside from getting more money from me to pay for a service they hadn_'_t delivered ).
negative	when you do get contact from them , they deny the items were out of stock and then let you know they will despatch .
neutral	product was great but i ordered on thursday am & paid for next_day delivery but it didn_'_t arrive until the monday
neutral	i am very pleased with the calendars as such .
neutral	i know it seems silly to be bothered by such a small item and at first i thought the same , but by the time i had suffered through their customer_services , i was quite irate !

negative	i asked for a full service , approx_£_00 .
positive	would buy from them again
neutral	admittedly workwear_express have said they would dispatch another pair if dpd cannot find them , however they said i would be waiting another week till the 00nd_jan . 0 - 0 working_days has now turned into 00 - 00 working_days .

positive	the fitter arrived on time on a sunday_afternoon and the job was done within half an_hour .

neutral	i ordered an 0in splash cymbal for my friend for christmas , but unfortunately the delivery date was a long time after , about 00 days in fact , but was then further postponed without telling_me when it would arrive , 0 days_later the item arrived .
neutral	over the 0 days i '_ve had it running , it has crashed twice .
neutral	did this for ease of ordering and it became very stressful amd hard i think it needs to be said on the website to check spam and also to be made clear that whatever the order there is always a requirement to communicate with the doctor and make lots of statements re promising to contact own gp etc
neutral	the website was bright , clear and easy to navigate , but the item was delivered a day later than the one given to me in an email and customer service wasn_'_t that easy to get through to .
negative	literally , the very next month they increased it to £_00 !

positive	i had been shopping around trying to find buckwheat after it was reccomended on the phase one diet by doug kaufman .
negative	that said , having better customer_support than the likes of bt is far from high praise and many other smaller uk isps offer similar or better support to their customers ( including during the hours you will actually be using the internet if you ’ re in gainful employment ).

neutral	don_'_t like systems where a pick_up is involved however they came at a decent
neutral	i felt that despite the friendly / quirky style of the emails , customer service ie making the customer feel secure , safe and important was not a great strength .

neutral	flowers delivered ok next_day , unfortunately 0 roses dead within 00_hours , lilies one stem dead in 0_days , very disappointed as they usually last a while & that is why i chose them .
positive	saw item required clearly on website and received within 0 days of ordering .
neutral	all fine , but considering the money we spent , ' would rather have a discount than a free mirror we do not really need .
positive	the range of headphones on offer is vast and the knowledge offered by hifi_headphones staff is just as big .
negative	update_: i have just read the response to my review from tech000 .
negative	the paypal system ( check out ) tried to keep sending my shirt to my paypal confirmed address ( the u . s .) and charge me 00 pounds s / h

positive	my girlfriend was so happy !
positive	received them together in a very quick time !
negative	to cut a long_story_short , do not use this website !
neutral	also we had to cut the bedroom blind by 00mm
negative	hide_behind what they claim is french jurisdiction even_though they are delivering into the uk .
neutral	the florist could have made more of an effort to replicate the colours .
positive	i choose the money to go straight_into my bank and i even got a text to tell me the progress of this .
neutral	if you receive a faulty product & contact them , they will try & tell you that you are doing something wrong & fob you off ,
negative	ironically , because of what i thought was excellent customer service , i ordered two more radiators !
negative	i dont see how they are still trading

neutral	the whole performance has_been quite testing .
positive	thank_you
negative	the assistant came back with my glasses .
positive	the products are clearly_laid_out on the website allowing you to understand what each of the product provides for the different work out goals .
neutral	as i wanted the item quickly i chose their express delivery at an extra £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	we did and we waited for 00_minutes which at 0am is a long time , only to have to phone them again to find that the driver had been waiting on chairs facing away from the cars .
negative	0 ) the wrong mattress was delivered , customer service said the mattress was no_longer available due to a change in stock , the result is we have had to accept a replacement mattress we did not want .

positive	excellent materials used in the construction .
neutral	good product but delivery a bit disappointed as the item was left_outside the door when i requested not to .
neutral	flowers are to a high_standard though i ask that when delivered that they knocked on door this did not happen as i was there at the time only found that my flowers were outside my door when i got email to say they been delivered .
neutral	although i respect all flowers are seasonal the flowers that i ordered were totally different in colour and variety to what is displayed on your website .

neutral	would not order by internet again .
neutral	in this day and age with technology the way it is . it really is unacceptable to make people wait all day for a delivery .
neutral	the villa has satellite_tv but it would make it far more enjoyable if there was also a sky package as not all of us go out in the evening / most evenings .
negative	update 00th_may
negative	the emails said that delivery ( via ubs ) had failed .
positive	delivery was quick .
negative	i will not be using this company ever again !
neutral	- t &_cs around returns are over bearing & were nearly enough to put me off ordering from them .
negative	the following week , we ordered three items and debenhams emailed confirmation of the order same day .
neutral	it actually needed more freesia to make it look lovely .
negative	looking online there is plenty of accommodation in glasgow city_centre .

positive	the website was easy to navigate_around , the prices are good and the delivery was super_fast .
positive	we were kept_informed by email and text as to when the bed would be delivered .
positive	i cant_believe_how easy it was to use etyres .
neutral	was told the cotbed would arrive at 0 . 00pm so waited in for the delivery only to have a call after this time saying delivery driver was in penzance and wouldn_'_t get to me .
negative	as a result , my order is irrelevant , and that '_s £ 0 wasted .
positive	thought the item was incorrect so got a replacement the next_day .
positive	the china came within_0days of ordering , was very carefully_packed , and looks brilliant on the kitchen dresser - a lovely modern_twist .
neutral	i was also puzzled as to why they returned some ( but not all ) of my old lenses .

positive	i definately will be using them again .
negative	better still they have started sending threatening_letters demanding payment of ' the bill ' despite my contacting them on numerous_occasions trying to sort_out the mess .
positive	product just as_described
neutral	although our car was parked near the airport and we were taken there and back satisfactorily , i feel that this business is in sore need of a little regulation .
positive	don_'_t throw it away you never know when you may need it again .
negative	bought a dvd_boxset from this joke of a company took a month & threat of legal_action before they refunded me but are the only comnpany i have ever known not to have a phoneline what a joke !
neutral	it wasn_'_t until we went to breakfast room that we were told by the gender confused man that we had continental breakfast included , not full english , it would have cost an extra £_00 per head .
neutral	boarding and cabin were perfect , we looked through the menu in our cabin and decided what to have , when we got to the restaurant we were given different menus . strange we thought but the lady explained our pre_- booked meal had to be chosen from the " a " menu , so we were fine to do that .
positive	price was good , coat was delivered quickly and as ordered . what more could you want !
positive	items i ordered were delivered early next_day .

positive	absolutely love to visit their leeds store even if it '_s just to have a quick peek at some gear and always feel_welcome .
negative	if your looking for a service provider i would strongly_urge you to look_elsewhere !
positive	when considering using the value of your home to raise cash it is so important to have everything explained in detail as this is a most_important decision ; peter did this .
negative	after two_days of ringing your company and being passed around , i get a phone_call from an engineer today asking me if i was at home so he could connect my phone line as he can '_t find the connection box , this is because it is inside my block of flats and was supposed to have been connected on the 0nd .
neutral	was this due to ordering on the internet and not from my catalogue ?
positive	jane , from morley
positive	very pleased would def use again
neutral	the wardrobe is now functioning reasonably well despite the slight forward bow in the middle of the door .
neutral	all went_smoothly .
negative	so i called at 00 . 00pm on a week night and was told by the chap i spoke to that he was " on reception " and " not best placed to respond to the call ".
positive	best of all the prices are all in my currency , including shipping .

neutral	i am almost at the brink of changing allegience to another company .
positive	thank_you so much for all your help .
neutral	which is a shame .
negative	but what a surprise - i haven_'_t heard a word since .
negative	for a brand such as thornton '_s they need to sort this out immediately - go onto their facebook and just see the amount of complaints and their distinct lack of adequate complaint resolutions .
negative	i was informed initially that an e_- mail would be sent when they wanted a reading for my account .
negative	having more than 00 years of experience within the hospitality and services industires with the usa , germany and the uk , i know what i am talking_about .
positive	my mum was delighted with the standard and quality of the gift_wrapped box .
negative	ordered and checked status which said completed on 00 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	i was pleased with item but little care was given to the way it was packaged for such an expensive purchase .
neutral	so i google ’ d what i wanted and the results included " my tuxedo ".
neutral	very pleased with the ordering and speed of delivery , my only issue is that the contents were packed in so tightly it had actually damaged one of the products .
neutral	grrr
negative	my order has not even arrived yet so i am very disappointed !
negative	go daddy are sooo_much more helpful , a fraction of the cost & up front & honest about their ongong renewal fees !
neutral	had quite a time with my recent yodel delivery .
negative	complete_care had still not delivered my order a month after_placing it and despite me chasing a number of times .
neutral	i found it very frustrating for two reasons_: 0 ) you have to wait about 0 minutes between check - ins , although some of the stores are only a few feet away from each other .
positive	i cannot recommend this company highly_enough .
positive	super to deal with and would recommend to friends

negative	no refund .
negative	!
neutral	on this occasion the 000_euro_deposit stated on my confirmation became a 0000 euro_deposit when i arrived at gold car in rome . that '_s their requirement for the class of car we hired .
negative	" i sincerely apologise for the lack of response from our customer service team .
neutral	i understand they try to be useful but please , let us buy a product , pay for it , received it ; that should be it .
positive	my delivery was very swift well_packed and in full .
negative	regards ,
positive	on departure , again the driver sorted our_luggage , opened all doors for us and upon arriving at the airport , even got us a trolley .
neutral	they refused , and i considered cancelling my order .
positive	order was shipped same day and received the next plus there were no postage_charges !
negative	afterr 0_hr with my voucher and reference_number nobody know about the damn car , so i hire directly from hertz which was excellent .
positive	trading_depot had the item in stock , with a description as detailed as the manufacturer , and notified me of its availability for immediate_despatch .
positive	friendly helpful staff who are able to help with anything and respond efficiently to any_queries .
neutral	i was also told different things by different members of staff .
negative	ever again .
neutral	but i think you should keep hen and stag dos apart_from other couples which are there for a different experience . we also found getting off the boat at each end was a pain .
neutral	monday arrived and only 0 of my 0 blinds turned_up !
positive	i have only ever bought knives from here but my first set have been excellent and all my visitors to my kitchen comment on them .
positive	best price available .
positive	having moved over to shopto after game '_s demise i '_ve been impressed , the prices have been the cheapest and the service is excellent
negative	i booked a flight with tripsta on the 00th of june .

negative	whilst they arrived in good time ( yesterday 0th_jan_0000 ) the flowers looked very old and tatty and will never be anything like the flowers portrayed on the website .
positive	the costume is very different and lovely bright_colours , she is delighted with it .
positive	!
negative	plumbnation failed to deliver on two occasions , and never bothered to even tell me they would not be coming so i have wasted two_days waiting in for nothing .
negative	maybe everyone was on tea break when these were passed .
positive	their staff at the shop and resorts are extremely professional and very helpful and even . pleasant !
neutral	don_'_t know about it
neutral	up to the last journey encountered no_problems at all .
neutral	0nd_class post would have been quicker and cheaper .
negative	i got no help whatsoever , the desk person was extremely rude , i had to find the man to do the outsize check in and find out where to take the bike afterwards .
negative	the website shop would not let_me despatch the goods to a place other than the billing_address and would not record the fact that i wanted gift_wrap etc .
positive	it '_s accessible and helpful to all types of people , weather a novice or a dedicated gym rat .
neutral	wrapping of some items were not very good .

positive	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you !!!
positive	delighted with product and service .
positive	ordered replacement mallet heads communication was spot on delivery as_descibed .
neutral	the toy place nice and helpful they need to use someone_else for delivery .
positive	not the best signs to it from the m0 ( only signs for short_stay ) but either way , not that difficult to find .
positive	great service !
negative	i eventually changed the order to something that was in stock as i had already waited 0_weeks for something that their website said was in stock .
negative	i have visitors arriving tomorrow night and am so cross that i am now going to have to spend tonight cleaning when i '_d give mopp 00 days notice to arrange a cleaner .
positive	an operator called jenny helped_me with an international shipment and looked in depth into a query for me .
positive	brilliant service .
negative	despite_numerous phone_calls , emails and threats of legal_action , no refund was ever given .
positive	it must be boring / annoying for them to have to respond to questions that have answers in their faq .
neutral	good price for product but next_day delivery would be appreciated
negative	i have used serenata before and they have been great .
positive	00_%_off all orders if you spend more than £_000 in a 0 year rolling period .
neutral	took 00_minutes to get through but i was promised the parcel would be with me the next_day .
negative	.
positive	rainford
positive	easy no_nonsense approach .
negative	also the flowers we ordered were named raspberry_ripple and were display with these colour with a lot of greenery , these came with similar colours but not greenery and nothing atall like the ones we thought we had ordered .
negative	three_days_later i received a termination letter telling_me that as i had applied to a new isp they would now be disconnecting my phone and broadband , even_though i am paid up to date .
negative	i have ordered from this site previously and flowers generally get delivered in the morning .
neutral	i keep using shop and scan on topcash , but more often than not my requests are refused .
positive	chose a delivery date which was my choose because the company where delivering in my area ( could of been delivered two_days previous ).
negative	i was told , when i rang , that the tyres could not be sourced - but that an_alternative could be supplied .
positive	will_definatley shop_here again .
neutral	i recently ordered two different products in different_styles but in my normal size .
positive	i would recommend as the price was great and the delivery very quick
positive	not only fast but kept me updated via_text and email at each_stage .
negative	but no real help in the matter .
positive	recommended to family as well !
negative	interparcel told me to wait_till 0 , then told me they could do nothing so i should contact tnt .
neutral	i contacted petplanet after my order which should have been received on next_day delivery had not arrived and was told my a rather apathetic individual that there had been delays in getting it to the main hub .
negative	nevertheless , the booking is until 0pm and then , later on , it was canceled .
negative	wont_be using this company again , unfortunately because the service was exceptional but the product was not .
negative	a set of watercolour brushes was ordered from saa for my birthday by my husband .
negative	vase was ok . had instructions to leave with neighbour which i did not ask for , and didnt bother to even wait for door to be opened .
neutral	when you buy large_quantity of seeds you need longer best before date
positive	excellent service .
negative	!
negative	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
positive	a fantastic experience from beginning to end . matt and the rest of the team are shinning example of excellent customer service .
neutral	receptionist not bothered .
positive	i arrived without a locking_wheel_nut , your guys were really helpful and said i could come_back at any time as the tyre was in stock .
positive	the time from order to delivery was exceptionally speedy .
negative	their telecommunications mast near my home broke_down in april_0000 , they new about the fault but seemed incapable or incompetent as they could not repair the mast months later .
negative	i gave them it and they provided a vague response that said there was a fault with a mast and they were working to fix it .
positive	online ordering was a breeze .
negative	!
neutral	but the customer service unfortunately is what i '_ll remember the most .
positive	extremely well_packaged .
neutral	but the really most frustrating thing was the guitar being reduced by £_000 the very next_day - grrrrrrrrrr !
positive	alpharooms had the accommodation we wanted and we were able to choose our flight times .
positive	roger
negative	c ' est grave il_n ' assume même_pas leurs erreurs .
neutral	i heard_nothing more until the 00th , when i received a " reminder " that the prescription had not been received .
negative	we signed for the box as damaged the driver also suggested this .
neutral	she said the packaging eas dreadfully battered .
positive	i received my order next_day , the packaging was second to none - my product was well_protected and arrived in perfect_condition .
positive	we were also thankful of her suggestion of the extra baggage_allowance and felt quite smug watching everyone else panicking with their lowly 00kg .
negative	this is absolutely typical of value basket , order and money were received and 0 days_later it was still being_processed , it had not even left their warehouse , almost three_weeks_later their update was it would be processed next week .
positive	will_definitely be going back to this group as i redecorate my flat !
negative	i hired a group h car ( mercedes_c or similar ) this spring in lisbon .
negative	i took the trouble to travel to your outlet to purchase white outdoor_lights , to be informed that you only had none of the two pin type left in stock .
neutral	there was a kind of rainbow effect on the first bottle i opened so i thought it was the style of bottle and it was supposed to be like that but when i opened the other two bottles , they were the same .
neutral	i think i won_'_t try second time .
positive	the next_day i received my cheque .
positive	good price '_s and a very good delivery service .
positive	sell everything i could want , always a very good price .
neutral	bit_disappointing ?
positive	quick delivery .

positive	superb site .
neutral	i ordered once , didnt love it and went back to nespresso .
positive	smashed the likes of interflora off the planet .
positive	ease of ordering , communication , reliability and speed all spot on .
positive	sheila bull
negative	the delivery of your order 000000000 was unsuccessful as the driver was unable to access the property .
positive	but this not a real problem .
positive	not only were they in stock , but they also offered to match play '_s price .
neutral	it cost me £_00 and some inconvenience to return the table , all avoidable if the website description had been more comprehensive with more pictures , particularly of the underside and leg arrangement .
neutral	la situación del apartamento fué inmejorable , pero había demasiado ruido por la noche , la calle era demasiado transitada para nuestro gusto , aunque por_lo_que vimos creo que toda barcelona es igual .
neutral	one of the cheapest stainless_steel hoods i could_find .
negative	zwazea000000000
neutral	my experience with scubastore in the beginning was overwhelmingly good .
neutral	i am also happy that they refunded me the difference_between the cost of energy with scottish_power and my new supplier on my final_bill so i was not out of pocket .
positive	i received the samples i ordered the next_day and after purchasing my order was delivered in less_than a week which is excellent with living in isle of man .
neutral	i immediately telephoned customer_services and spoke to clare caswell who was quite sympathetic and said i should not have been spoken to in such a way in my own_home .
neutral	i use tesco every week as it '_s convenient .

positive	i would definitely use the site again and recommend it to others .
neutral	nearly and hour and a half later he '_s still not there .
negative	no responses to the emails ( responding to the previous emails they sent me )
positive	my order was received and despatched extremely quickly .
negative	without a doubt , the worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
positive	i ordered these on line -- they are fantastic - the colours jump out at you -- these were for a lady in another flat that has partial site she can see different_colours -- they are wrapped around her balcony -- she '_s been getting out of bed just to see them glow -- they seem to work straight_away -- now she is trying the different sequents to flash - dance - and others she '_s trying them all -- because the dragonfly are white these show up the different colour bulbs when charged perfect -- very pretty
positive	ordered late_afternoon and delivered the next_morning .
negative	no service at all really . despite saying no to a 0am delivery in the first instance , told on 0 further occasions that that would be the delivery time .
positive	would definitely use again .
positive	joanne smith
negative	i took the day off and waited all day and the delivery never showed .
neutral	no faults to be fair , but the prices are high
negative	still_haven_'_t got the part but the phone operator was helpful and said would refund my payment .
negative	as a seller you have little , if any , recourse to complain unlike with e_- bay '_s feedback system .
positive	extra services including disconnecting / connecting and removal of old appliances is invaluable .
neutral	the blinds looks really beautiful .
negative	i could perhaps take legal_action .
neutral	as such i am_afraid i will be looking for an_alternative supplier next time .
neutral	i think it was an oil gun that i bought from you .
positive	wouln '_t_hesitate to order from them again .
neutral	so not very impressed !
positive	worth saying sportpursuit were recommended to me by three other happy customers i met on holiday so clearly not a fluke .
negative	plus we have our party on friday .
negative	very unhappy with this company .
negative	i were calling bt trying to get help on their facebook profile but is already 00 days from my disconnection time and things aren_'_t moving inch forward .
positive	this product was as_described and arrived in good time .
neutral	for the last couple of years though i '_ve seen a trend for their prices being the same as the high_street , but you still have to wait 0 days for the items instead of grabbing them there and then .
negative	according to their terms and conditions , i should know for sure within 00_hours if i have tickets or not .
positive	thank_you .
negative	it '_s a lovely website with a lot of choice of colours and styles .
negative	nothing worked so i went back to simplyelectronics and reported the problem .
positive	they arrived on time , lovely individual packaging and even better they fitted_perfectly !
neutral	i ordered and paid for four dog worming_tablets from vet -_medic .
neutral	the credit_card issue is not my issue , which is how i was made to feel .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before if i had known they were this bad i could have saved_myself and other hens a lot of time a stress .
neutral	the rubber is really thin and so i don_'_t think they will last very long .
negative	cartrawler have refused to refund or do anything about it , even_though they were happy to take the money .
negative	after technical_support done their tests they told me it was their problem as their system wasn_'_t accepting my username and password and if it wasn_'_t fixed the next_day to phone them .
neutral	thanks

positive	great service , very easy to use online and fast delivery
positive	so i emailed havens and after a couple of emails and a phone_call all was sorted , the whole lot was delivered the following_day .
negative	we have investigated your price match request and unfortunately cannot fulfil it as , although a valid competitors price has_been quoted , it is below our buying in price for the item ( s ).
neutral	i ordered riemann p00 once - a - day sunfilter lotion spf00 on the 00th_june , sent a email and phoned on the 00th_june as still not recieved , said it could take up to 0 working_days well it '_s been 0 and still_waiting .
neutral	finally we also nearly drove_away in an unsafe car .
negative	i booked a spa break at the stratford manor only to get there bad find that i had been booked into the stratford which didn_'_t have a spa !
positive	then accurate time of delivery via_text , great service and it '_s the best chicken i have tasted , blasts any supermarket out of the water for size / weight and price
neutral	i had to return the memory before they ' d ship a new one .
positive	saw the serenata_flowers just before christmas when they sent me an_email .
positive	thanks guys .
neutral	i was naturally quite put out by this as it was way above my budget .
neutral	the mount for the bike computer box was also bashed and did not look the nice christmas gift i intended .
neutral	good points :- the trampoline came on the day it was promised - quick free delivery - no_hassle .
negative	to summarise : avoid dell if you value your_sanity .
positive	easy to order - arrived earlier_than_expected and on a sunday
negative	and they say 0 day over the returns day i : e on the 0th day not the 0th !.
neutral	a indispensable gift site all year ' round but a must visit at crimbo .
negative	they won_'_t open a case but apparently my phone keeps saying it '_s not registered to the network !!
negative	i waited another four days and called again , got [_name_] ( customer_services ) told me it would be " 0 working_days to process any refunds "
positive	two_days_later , my order arrived on site saving me several hundreds of pounds .
negative	buy somewhere_else .
positive	the best part is when i open a new bag .
negative	top tip_: avoid like the plague !!!!!
positive	kept_fully_informed of the orders progress .
neutral	a single folder with very basic information and a lot of repetition .
positive	i would recommend the company to anyone
positive	great service - there was a delay with suppliers and i was kept in touch all the time , delivery was prompt and reliable .
neutral	ordered some xmas_presents online .
neutral	this was ignored ( according to the courier it wasnt passed on to them ) and meant that because i missed the courier by only 00_minutes , i had to chase him around town to get my parcel off him before it went back to the depot .
negative	we had to wait 00mins at the airport ( with no communication from stressfree_parking until the driver eventually arrived .
neutral	can be problematic with voucher redemption and not as good as [_external_reference_]
neutral	however i feel the delivery is very slow , i did really expect my goods within 0_days but then maybe that ijust me having a high expectation .
neutral	we have used travel_nation previously in 0000 when it was a smaller organisation .
neutral	emailed customer_services again !
neutral	basic errors that should be resolved during testing
negative	the hotels were great but said we had to go through_expedia to change the hotel .
positive	i have had no delivery problems and the meat is always chilled when it arrives .
neutral	please stop sending me junk_mail .
positive	this attention goes beyond the norm .
negative	jo robinson
neutral	this was very tricky because the turkish representatives spoke little english and so i had to ask our hotel reception staff to speak with them for us .
positive	however with mazuma i couldnt find a bad review and sent off my application for my phone to be sent back , amazing turn_around the money was in my bank_account within a few_days , definetley recomend thanks .
positive	my delivery came as expected in a special insulated box with ice_packs .
negative	now that '_s what eflorist should say on their website , it would in my experience be more honest !
neutral	the actual treatment involved about and hour of delay before i finally got to the treatment room so i was pretty nervous .
neutral	good service but slightly_disappointed in the coffee as it is certainly not as good and much weaker than my usual coffee .
negative	since them i have received monosyllabic questions and replies via_email from customer_services every week or so .
negative	looks_like all they want to do is make money for expedia and guide you towards hotels where they make most money .
neutral	overall now satisfied with the outcome and would be happy to use them again .
negative	i ordered on 00 / 00 and received the glasses on 00 / 00 .
negative	what an appalling service and even worse attitude to customer service .
neutral	that '_s good service .

negative	then esop spoke to twice ????
positive	the price of brushes , paper , paints etc .
positive	all good

positive	truly_amazing .
neutral	but fast and easy to usem
neutral	this appliance protection issue spoilt what was otherwise a 0_star experience with ao .
negative	is it about time these types of companies and the courier they use were investigated to see how our valuable packages are actually handled ?
negative	however this proved just too difficult for them to do .
positive	clubs ordered simply and at speed ( they are for my father in law - i know nothing about the technical terms , etc but they were very good to talk me though ).
neutral	this time i was asked many more questions and my medication was logged correctly , not just in my notes section .
positive	can '_t fault the service , i would definately use them again and they were cheaper_than other_sites
neutral	item great , price great , let_down by delivery company who dropped it and damaged the corner !
positive	!
positive	coming_back to the hotel was also straight_forward and only took 0 mins . this was travelling to and from gatwick_north_terminal . oh the price was good to .

neutral	£_00 for a round of golf for two was the best deal ive_seen .
positive	the post - op care was excellent too .
positive	i have always found the service , choice and delivery to be of the highest_standards possible .
neutral	might buy a second one and try a small .
negative	it all stinks of misinformation and im none the wiser
neutral	i only use this site occasionally after checking prices thoroughly and only if items meet the £_00 min spend for free delivery otherwise it '_s pointless !
negative	more trouble than it '_s worth , had more value for money using topcashback and less time wasted too .
neutral	especially as the ones i had before broke after a year ( so they were out of warranty ) makes me think i should use high_street_opticians in future even_though a bit more_expensive .

negative	i didn_'_t and after 0 hour 00_mins they agreed to send another bouquet - however it has not been received !
negative	now , i was not an unhappy talk_talk customer as have been with them for years and so , caught offhand and realising that you get nothing for nothing no matter what the sales_guy tells you , i said okay .
negative	the saet is fixed andcant be slided out or in and it doesnt support the entire lenght of the thighs thus putting a lot of stress on the lower back .
negative	i thought that everything was uk stock and would take delivery next_day . seems they not uk_based and order confirmation 00_hours after_placing order and 0 to 0 day after that for delivery , not good if your looking to replace bits and practice mid week .
neutral	delivery was excellent ( next_day , even_though i had not paid for that ) but overall it is expensive ; i paid the equivalent of about £_00 per unit but i have seen similar units for £_00 [_link_] and £_00 [_link ].
positive	brilliant !
neutral	had me worried for a while as delivery as a little late but when it arrived it was great
positive	the item was delivered next working day for free without_any_problems .
positive	after a search for new tyres i stumbled_across grippy .
negative	she said she would refund me and offered me a free clean in the future !!!!
neutral	i then rang again when it hadn_'_t arrived to be told the same thing , only after the third chasing phone_call was i told it was actually being sent that afternoon , i received two_thirds of the order the following_day , that was a week after_placing the order .
positive	after_comparing_prices on other_websites , the price here was the best and the delivery was really quick .

positive	excellent comms excellent product , first_class service .
neutral	collections are a nightmare !
positive	bought ramp for elderly_aunt to use with wheelchair service & product were excellent .
neutral	however , the reason i would hesitate to buy again from worldstores is that the product descriptions and photographs on their website are really not good enough .
positive	the unlocking was done well within the time period started and by following the clear_instructions , i was able to complete the unlock .
negative	i attended and gave my keys to a man who looked round the car for damage .

negative	crap service x0 , crap eye_test x0 , crap everything . avoid .
negative	he said ( and this is classic ) ' we only book them the day before !'
neutral	sure , i can pay for next_day delivery for a lot more money which is fine as that '_s what the courier charges , but if i place an order using the cheapest delivery you should despatch same day rather_than make me wait and despatch 0 / 0 working_days_later because that '_s the delivery service i paid for .

negative	ridiculous seeing as they said 0 working_days !
negative	i am very dissapointed and will never buy from them again in fear of not liking the product .
negative	we decided to ignore them as we have had good service in the past .
negative	what make it worse in my opinion is that they will only agree to the price quoted if they agree the condition , so where as my ipad could have been worth £_000 in the condition that they though it was , because the only agreed price is £_000 they new price is now £_000 which i think is wrong , and i would have been happy to accept the £_000 .
neutral	the site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful .

neutral	0 .
negative	you can never get a straight answer out of the staff either on the phone or in store , it is always someone_else who needs to help you !!
positive	good tips on buying the right glasses and whats fashionable .
