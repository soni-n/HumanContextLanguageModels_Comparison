negative	the rrp on the precious_little_ones site is misleading and a downright cheat to make you believe you ' re getting more for your money .
negative	i am in two_minds to report them so other customers aren_'_t duped in the same way .
negative	would give no stars if it were an option !
negative	tried to watch live itv_player for britains got talent constantly showed ads and crashed with fleeting seconds of the show .
negative	it '_s that same with breakfast tv .
negative	i give up other channels live and catch up streams are far_superior
negative	get your act_together itv
negative	been in o0 shop today at blackpool worst service ever .
negative	trying 0 cancel my contract which is up this month jan , stupid people .
negative	endid u sending me a pay and go sim .
negative	why would i want one of those .
negative	i would not recommed them 0 anyone .
negative	the only_reason i got o0 in first place was shawn bean .
negative	lol .
negative	not happy with the service at all , money taken and we are still_waiting for our parcel .
negative	received wrong parcel , sent it back which cost £_00 , spoke to someone to chasse it up , was reassured that will get to us last_week as well as the refund for postage and still_waiting for both .
negative	received a delivery note yesterday to advise yodel had tried to deliver parcel .
negative	i was at work so couldn_'_t receive it .
negative	so i went online to arrange_redelivery for today to my work address .
negative	the parcel was red liveried today , but to my home address .
negative	what is the point of asking if you want to change the address if you are going to ignore the instructions ?
negative	had the same problem a couple of years_ago with an ipad that wasn_'_t delivered on the agreed day .
negative	twice !
negative	to add_insult to injury , i get even get to speak to a representative of the company .
negative	every number i try is the same automated_message with no option to speak to a real_person .
negative	obviously , yodel are used to complaints , so the choose to simply prevent customers from making any .
negative	i wish businesses would stop using this company as it '_s the customers who suffer from waiting for non - deliveries .
negative	i would give no stars if i could .
negative	this product was purchased on 0 / 0 / 00 and still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	it states under the tracking # delivery unsuccessful !!!!
negative	this product was listed in euro '_s which was confusing i thought the purchase price was $_00 . 00 in american money , it was $_00 . 00 in euro '_s .
negative	oh i live in the us and wasn_'_t paying attention to euro '_s sign .
negative	very dissatisfied .
negative	tried_calling the contact # and it won_'_t go through from the us .
negative	it '_s been two_weeks and i haven_'_t received my goods .
negative	she was also take aback to the reaction she got when she e_mailed you to complain
negative	i was 0_months pregnant , it was a crush with idiots who have to run and push their way to the front to try to get the best seats regardless of other people they knock out of the way ( there are enough seats for everyone get a grip ) and i never got a drink although i asked 0 times ,
negative	loads of problems trying to order online using my card , as i got_married and changed my name on the card and different number it still refused me and reverted_back to my maiden_name tried_ringing the service desk and they couldnt help me so i can never shop at tesco . com
negative	so disappointed that i wasn_'_t told about losing my bonus , i can '_t wait_till my balance is paid cos i '_m closing my account , it feels_like i was robbed of over 00_quid !
negative	i had never used this company before and first attempted booking my tickets online .
negative	however , i had a few simple questions about the train line .
negative	i walked to the beeston train_station today hoping that asking my questions in person would be the least frustrating and easiest_way to find answers .
negative	unfortunately , i was completely wrong .
negative	the blonde , 00 something year_old woman behind the glass window was rude , cold and frankly ... completely_useless .
negative	as a 00 year_old student who has just moved across the world from canada to the uk , trying to find the easiest routes in the most effective and inexpensive way is very valuable to me .
negative	regardless of whether this woman likes her job or not she could at_least put some effort into it .
negative	it was a very unpleasant experience that i hope no one else has to go through .
negative	i booked a sleeper ticket , fully expecting this to be a sleeper berth ( including indicating my gender ).
negative	my husband booked a similar ticket through train line and ended_up having to sit up all night because it was not a sleeper berth .
negative	when he told me this , i called customer support to ask if i had indeed booked a sleeper .
negative	the person told me he did not know , to call scotrail .
negative	scotrail said i had a seat , not a sleeping berth , so i called train line again ( costing 00p_per_minute plus my time at work ).
negative	this time , they told me i could cancel the ticket for the 00 pound return fee plus i had to post the tickets by registered_post wasting yet more time and money .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor who called me back and reiterated that i would have to pay the cancellation_fee and waste time at the post_office despite the website misrepresenting what i was buying .
negative	my ticket clearly_stated sleeper but had a seat assignment .
negative	it is completely_unacceptable to misrepresent what they are selling then charge me 00 pounds plus registered_post and a wasted 0 hours on the phone .
negative	this treatment is completely_unacceptable .
negative	i had a mobile phone contract with carphonewarehouse for nearly 0 years and when i tried to renew my contract with them they told me that i failed their security_check !
negative	i was then told to go in to a store to get my new contract and phone .
negative	i went in to the store and went through their security_check to be told that i failed it again .
negative	so i went straight to the 0 mobile store and signed_up for a contract directly with them .
negative	when i received my last bill it had a credit balance on it but i never received the money back in my bank_account .
negative	it didn_'_t say anywhere on the bill how i could get the money back .
negative	i emailed them and they said they can arrange for the money to be paid back onto my debit_card if i called their customer service .
negative	so i called their customer service and the agent told me he could send me a cheque but couldn_'_t refund it onto my debit_card .
negative	i then spoke to their complaints_department and had a painful conversation with them where they were reluctant to even apologise !
negative	i ordered from this company using a group on voucher , didn_'_t realise_until afterwards it could take up to 0_weeks for delivery .
negative	0_weeks_later despite_numerous_emails from me , i was still_waiting for my bean_bag .
negative	each email i sent asking for an estimated dispatch date , was followed with the most_unhelpful reply along the lines of , your beanbag will be dispatched in due course and you will receive a email_advising of a delivery date .
negative	that '_s fine but it hardly answered my question .
negative	cancelled my order in the end , though i had to go to group on for the voucher and them for the delivery fee .
negative	went to a much_better company and got next_day delivery .
negative	would never use this company again .
negative	appalling !
negative	we ordered a barbecue over the weekend and paid_extra to nominate wednesday as a delivery day .
negative	i took wednesday off work as planned .
negative	received a text at 0am saying the item would be delivered between_0am - 0pm .
negative	needless to say nothing arrived .
negative	i telephoned customer service at 0 . 00pm and was told they couldn_'_t help me but that the driver was probably working over time and would be with me soon .
negative	nothing arrived .
negative	next_morning i had to book another day off work .
negative	i telephoned customer service again and was told they would speak to the delivery company and call back .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	i called customer service again at 00 . 00am and was told this time they would definitely call me back with an estimated time of delivery .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	at 0pm the delivery finally arrived .
negative	the driver knocked on the door and asked if i would help with the box as it weighed 00kgs and he couldn_'_t lift it .
negative	i said unfortunately i couldn_'_t as i had recently suffered 0 slipped discs in my back and wasn_'_t about to risk that again .
negative	i was told if i couldn_'_t help then he would have to take it away !
negative	thankfully some nearby workmen offered to carry it in for him .
negative	all in all a terrible shopping_experience .
negative	i certainly will not be shopping with them again and only wish i '_d read the reviews before making my purchase .
negative	bought a bikini_top and matching bottoms .
negative	paid express delivery as i was going away just 0_days_later .
negative	item arrived but bikini_top was damaged and to be honest both items were extremely poor quality given the cost (£_00 for the top and £_00 for the bottoms ).
negative	as i didn_'_t have time to wait for a replacement i sent both items back .
negative	that was 0_weeks_ago .
negative	today i have finally received a refund of £_00 - the total_cost of my order was £_00 . 00 !
negative	it seems they are very interested in taking your money but not at all interested in providing any form of after sales or customer service .
negative	as they are in breech of the sale of goods_act ( distance_selling regulations ) i will be reporting this and taking the matter further .
negative	just to note that on their website under the returns_policy it states that any un - wanted items can be returned but will only be exchanged for store credit .
negative	distance_selling law states that the consumer is legally entitled to a full_refund of any un - used item purchased online if returned within 00 days .
negative	again they are in breech of standard consumer_law .
negative	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they '_ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
negative	!
negative	i was well aware i '_d be offered less because of the mark , which is only visible on a white_background and doesn_'_t affect the operation of the phone , but £ 0 . 00 !!!
negative	come on that '_s crazy !
negative	and there '_s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
negative	have rejected the offer and will be interested to see what condition the phone is in when i receive it back !
negative	i had a similar problem with mazuma , but at_least they offered £_00 for it - still unfair but better_than envirofone !
negative	i rejected mazuma '_s offer and went with envirofone cos i thought they '_d offer me a better deal but how wrong was i !
negative	think i '_ll try selling my phone privately , i might actually get a fair price for it , esp as i had the phone for almost 0 years and it '_s still in working order !
negative	really unhappy with mazuma - they offered me £_00 for my iphone 0 00gb , on receiving it , they inform_me they '_ve found a tiny yellow mark that '_s only visible on a white_background ( eg .
negative	in the settings folder ) and therefore it '_s classed_as faulty and they '_ll only offer me £_00 !!
negative	!
negative	i understand a small drop in the price but i don_'_t think that warrants a £_00 drop in the price , i argued this point on the phone but they refused to budge !
negative	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .
negative	sold it through a competitor who happily paid £_00 for it !
negative	and to top it all off , mazuma wouldn_'_t let_me post this review on their website , funny that !
negative	they clearly only want good reviews on there !
negative	definitely wouldn_'_t recommend , avoid at all costs !
negative	i recieved an_email_saying my flight had been canceled so automatically i wanted to get in contact with someone to get a refund so that i can buy new flights .
negative	it '_s been 0_days and i still_haven_'_t had a reply .
negative	this is a terrible service and i won_'_t be using tripsta again .
negative	i booked flights with budgetair . co . uk on 00 / 00 .
negative	i waited for a confirmation message to appear after i had paid for my flights and instead got a message_saying that they have received payment but my flights are not available .
negative	i '_m not quite sure how it is acceptable to take someones money and then not give them the flights ?
negative	the message just stated that i have to contact them for a refund which will take 0_days to process , a refund for what ?
negative	i haven_'_t got any flights ????
negative	i am unable to contact the company as i am_currently abroad , also i don_'_t appreciate that i would have to pay 00p a minute to speak to someone to get my money back .
negative	so now they have taken my money and i have to try and get it back , it will take 0_days for a refund to process and that money is what i needed to buy my flights with .
negative	absolutely terrible service .
negative	did not like site
negative	the wrong item was sent to me last_week ( order # 000000000 ) and i have not received a response to the 0 emails i have sent .
negative	the website states ' if you have received an incorrect item , please email info_@ rarelondon . com with details of your order number , the style code / name of the item received and the item missing .
negative	customer_services will make every effort to ensure that you receive the correct item within one working day .
negative	( stock depending )' yet it has now been 0 working_days and i have not even received a reply to my emails despite detailing the issue as requested above .
negative	i simply want the correct item to be delivered to me , not too much to ask from an online_retailer .
negative	the customer service is unacceptable .
negative	i originally booked a cleaner for 0 hours a week stating that i required them to work on a thursday or friday .
negative	after 0_weeks of a pretty poor standard of cleaning , the cleaner told my 00 year_old_son that she could clean the house in 0 hours .
negative	i started leaving notes asking for specific things to be done eg ; please use feather duster as we seem to be inundated with cobwebs .
negative	these were ignored !!!
negative	i rang the agency and told them the cleaner was useless so they sent me another one to interview .
negative	she seemed pleasant enough but couldnt start till the following thursday so my house went uncleaned .
negative	she cleaned the house to an acceptable standard but then text me to say she couldnt do a thursday or friday and had told the agency to send me someone_else .
negative	i interviewed the 0rd cleaner ( in 0_weeks ) and at the end of the interview i asked her if she could start the following thursday to be told that she could only do tuesdays !!!
negative	the agency had failed to tell her my requirements , wasting my time and hers .
negative	i rang the agency and told them i thought it best to call it a day as they obviously cannot provide what they advertise !!!
negative	i also had to pay the one month cancellation_fee .
negative	i '_m now thinking of contacting_trading_standards as this agency is not fit for purpose !!!
negative	!
negative	bought costume paid £ 0 . 00 for speedy delivery £_00 . 00 all paid in full on 00th_october_0000 still no costume to this day and escapade are ignoring there phones and have not responded to emails .
negative	i '_m totally_disgusted as they have not even refunded money to my bank_account .
negative	would never recommend them to anyone !!
negative	!
negative	telephonist was rude to me on initial_contact on arrival at airport as i was having mobile phone problems so i missed a call from him .
negative	drop_off otherwise was ok with very pleasant contact at airport car_park .
negative	on return i rang as instructed after passport_control and was told off as should have rung once baggage collected and again operator was rude to me although i had followed instructions on sheet .
negative	it then took 00_mins to contact them later as phone no provided was not available .
negative	parcel booked for collection today but no courier turned_up .
negative	parcel0go response was to offer collection tomorrow , no apology or explanation .
negative	i can only_assume that all parcel0go staff work from home so can wait in for several days in the hope that a courier might turn_up , most of us can '_t .
negative	and , parcel0go , don_'_t bother with the ' contact us and we will investigate ' response , i had this last time i used your services over a year_ago , same problem and investigation was lip service !
negative	we have just had our 0rd or 0th delivery of oak_furniture - as before lovely furniture and well made .
negative	unfortunately this time we were not given the option of having the delivery on a monday - this had always been possible in the past but the lady on the phone to my husband categorically said no , even_though we were happy to wait a bit longer for delivery .
negative	the answer was still no and no discussion was possible either - not impressed .
negative	due to this my husband had to take the day off work , possibly with no pay .
negative	we shall not be buying from here again .
negative	the delivery guys as usual were marvellous .
negative	half the tv in the seats didnt work , no vegan option for food , a 00 hour flight with no food ....... come on ... it dont take much to cater for veggies and vegans these days
negative	they sold a laptop to my friend who is blind , he had special software to help him use the machine until the hard_disk died .
negative	although the laptop had on site warranty , they refused to send someone out .
negative	the asked him to dismantle the laptop ( something most people with full vision would struggle with ) to check the hard_disk , when told he was blind they still refused to honour the onsite warranty until this proceedure had been carried_out
negative	bought 0 items from amazon over 0_days , the delivery companies they use govern when or if we receive the item , home delivery network are a useless buch of scruffy oiks that lie on the delivery sheet , turn_up if an when they feel like it , and faced with a 000mtr dive up the lane to my house would rather mark the item undeliverable and send it back .
negative	amazon issues a refund then emails you to say if you still want the item then you have to re - order it .... hello muppets >>>> thats_why i ordered it in the first place .... wont order from amazon again as if i order on line i expect it to be delivered
negative	i did order with another on line shop and had it delivered next_day
negative	should have a negative star system one star is far too generous for these amazonian muppets
negative	to say that i was disappointed would be an_understatement .
negative	i could have purchased twice the amount of flowers at half the price from my nearest tescos .
negative	i would never purchase from this company again and never recommend it to anyone_else wanting flowers for that special oocasion .
negative	die_lieferung sollte vor zwei wochen zugestellt werden , wurde aber bisher noch nicht erhalten .
negative	nach mehreren beschwerden ueber euroflorists webseite habe_ich bisher noch keine antwort erhalten , warum die_blumen nicht geliefert wurden und wann ich mein geld zurückerhalte .
negative	delivered a faulty washing_machine on monday 00th_dec ( hotpoint_washing_machine wmef000puk ) which had a 0cm split in the waste_pipe , which subsequently flooded the kitchen .
negative	reported to customer_services who can ’_t replace faulty machine but have arranged for an engineer to visit mon 00rd_dec to repair rather_than replace brand_new machine .
negative	absolutely appalled at service , will need to take more take off work ( once for delivery and once for engineer ’_s visit ).
negative	wanted to support a local company rather_than buy from internet , but will not buy from marks_electricals again and definitely will not recommend others to use .
negative	why can '_t i purchase spare_parts for my computer i purchase from you mr [_name_]
negative	switched gas supplier from npower to sse in august last_year .
negative	npower put an estimated reading on my final_bill that was much higher than my actual reading .
negative	i have spoken to them about 0 times_now about this and i still don_'_t have an amended bill .
negative	every time i ring their call_centre the wait time is around 00_minutes .
negative	it '_s now march of the year after and this is still not sorted grrrrr !
negative	when i bought the costume i waited 0_weeks and it was never delivered .
negative	i then had go out and buy another costme for a party that was only one day away and spend twice as much money .
negative	when i called the help centre , the man simply told me to send an e_- mail to them on the contact us page and two_weeks_later i still havn_'_t heard_anything .
negative	i stupidly didnt read the reviews before i placed an order for 0 x luxury hampers .
negative	firstly , delivery was late so i called to check .
negative	upon_calling i was told that there were ' delays ' and promised delivery would be the following_day and was told i could have a full_refund if not .
negative	apparently they were delivered 0_days_later by which point , was too late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
negative	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
negative	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
negative	trying to get a refund but it '_s a long , painful process and emails were ignored for weeks .
negative	in addition to this , they send far too many marketing emails which i find insulting given the service .
negative	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing_ones .
negative	my son ordered these for valentines_day but we don_'_t know if they have been delivered .
negative	he is on deployment with the forces and we can '_t ask can we .
negative	what happened to the text_messages you usually send
negative	i ordered three items online in my latest order .
negative	two of the items arrived 0 working_days ahead of when i needed them so i was really pleased .
negative	one item was missing from the package although the despatch_note said it was included .
negative	i emailed the care address as instructed for missing items and received a reply asking for photos of the package , which i duly did on 00th_march , although this wouldn_'_t show anything unexpected .
negative	to date ( 0th_april ) i have neither received the missing item which i have already paid for nor even received a reply to this email .
negative	so my rating has_gone from 0 to 0 .
negative	further_action is most definitely needed !!!!
negative	!
negative	warning !!!
negative	do not use this company !
negative	i ordered bedroom_furniture on 00th of july , by 00th of august i had not received any correspondance apart_from an_email_confirming my payment .
negative	every phone_call was met by an answerphone_message and when i did get through i was told that a check would be made with the supplier and i would be called back - i never received a call .
negative	eventually i got in touch with trading_standards who advised me to write to them demanding my money back since after 00 days they had breached their contract by not delivering .
negative	i received no response to this letter .
negative	again i got in touch with them ( after many phone_calls ) and was told the money would be refunded .
negative	by 00th_september i had still not received my money back .
negative	my bank have now launched a fraud investgation against them .
negative	total scammers - do not use this company !!!!
negative	!
negative	please read this honest account of my problems
negative	after checking out previous_reviews and visiting the showroom we decided to go to one place to order everything as being disabled my hubby thought it would be easier although somethings were more_expensive despite_being on sale ...
negative	how wrong can you be or am i just very unlucky ?
negative	paid_extra on top of delivery charges for delivery on a certain day because we were going away while bathroom being done with me being disabled .
negative	day 0 - half the order arrived and one pallet was damaged - and had been cobbled together with odds pieces of wood and huge nails sticking out - all the items were damaged very noticeably .
negative	why did it leave the warehouse in that condition ?
negative	after numerous phone_calls which nobody returned despite promising an_hour ... eventually ( after having to scan in my delivery note copy re damaged and missing items and email it to prove it as delivery company said nothing reported !)
negative	the rest of order and replacements items were sorted_out in the nick of time and promised next_day ... items delivered seemed okay except one item missing - nothing important just the shower_cubicle
negative	next_day after phone_calls again the shower_cubicle arrived - on a pallet huge and secured - on my own and disabled and driver left it on pallet ( just like other goods ) on my front - no noticeable damage at this time .
negative	had to go away - fitter found a hole in bottom of shower_cubicle box when he lifted it off the pallet with glass pieces trickling out - photographed it and rang and to ask about returning easy plumb tray - told to ring back monday - went through rigmoroll again and eventually the following friday another cubicle delivered .
negative	all this and on top not been able to return the easy plumb kit for a refund that was not used but we did not know until too late because of delays caused by the company .
negative	all in all a thoroughly horrendous_experience .
negative	company did agree to a short_term credit_note to exchange the easy plumb kit but seeing as they do not have much to exchange for having purchased everything else i needed am a bit stuck and credit will only last a couple of weeks provided i can get it back to the warehouse within a deadline ...
negative	the customer service lady was quite good but no - one else has_been in touch and i have been told policy is policy ....
negative	i just hope to goodness we do not have any_problems with the goods once installed as it does not forebear well with the experience i have had so far .
negative	so - check everything in minute detail - record everything - and be very quick about it and make_sure you return everything broken with the driver .
negative	if you do as the company suggests and get stuff delivered before you get a date for fitting then check everything and thoroughly - do not wait for your fitter and if you are disabled then get some strong men to be there for delivery and check it for you .
negative	do not trust that the box seems okay so the goods must be !
negative	i am very very stressed about the whole_thing and i certainly cannot recommend this company .
negative	one thing broken or missing in a large order - perhaps , but not this much_trouble .
negative	addition 0 . 00 . 00
negative	another huge joke - the agreement states exchanges within 00days yet i was told a different tale when i asked about exchanging something saying i only had another 0_days for an exchange and they then only hold the credit for 0_weeks or i would lose it all , despite_being away on holiday and being disabled which is why we were going away while the bathroom was being fitted .
negative	the item was the 0nd time it was delivered ( first one broken ) and it was finally delivered again with no box within a pallet of cling filmed other goods - i was as good as called a liar by the warehouse in that they never ever send out unboxed goods when i invited him to comment on our other problems ...
negative	they never ever break anything and that my goods were never missing - nothing ever went wrong in his warehouse !
negative	please_please be aware of this disasterous company
negative	there were 0 people queing to complain when we were there and also when my fitter had to go to pick something up they never bothered to tell us was necessary he was also in a queue of complaints .
negative	when i invisted customer service agent to pass on my complaint to a manager and either speak to me or email his comments i was told
negative	" unfortunately a manger isn_’_t going to advise you any different , this is a company policy and we all abide by the same rules ."
negative	so no - one cares at all .
negative	i have a faulty tap and no_doubt i will get nowhere with that !
negative	i am very angry , very tearful and bitterely dissapointed in their disinterest and complete disregard of customer_satisfaction once your money is taken .
negative	i '_ve been a fan of a range of lush '_s products in the past and have always found store staff to be very helpful .
negative	however , recently i had an issue with a henna product i purchased .
negative	i emailed customer service to outline my issue .
negative	customer_services emailed me back , i was expecting a nice response , possibly an_apology and that maybe they would look into my issue or perhaps re - evaluate the way they market their product in the future .
negative	nope , i got a chunk of text copied out from some sort of manual , it did not in any way answer my complaint .
negative	i thanked them for their email but then stated that i would like an actual response to my issues .
negative	0 week_later i received another email that in no way answered my complaint .
negative	i tried again and yet again waited another week for another email that was pretty_much the same as the first one .
negative	by this point i had lost my will to live with them .
negative	i won_'_t buy from a company that doesn_'_t listen to it '_s customers , it '_s really not hard and is unacceptable from a company their size .
negative	i seriously think my guinea_pig could write a better response email .
negative	they need to buck it up there are a lot of great , vegan , organic beauty companies out there which i will happily spend my money on instead of a company where you have no fallback or support when there are issues with their products .
negative	uch bad lush .
negative	without_doubt the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	i purchased 0 large bags of dog_food from this company and after using the first one ( which took a couple of months to get through ) opened the 0nd to find it mouldy .
negative	i contacted feedem ( within the 0_months my consumer_rights allow ) and told them i had cleared the food out as it was a h_& s issue in my house ( as i am legally allowed to ) but sent photographic_evidence of the mould .
negative	i was first told this would be replaced but then received the most disgusting email from them calling me irresponsible and pretty_much telling_me it was my fault the food was mouldy and that i couldnt prove otherwise ( my consumer_rights state that i do not have to prove it was fault0 ).
negative	i contacted them again clearly stating my consumer right and was ignored ( up to 0 times so far ) so got my local citizens_advice to contact them - again they made out i was in the wrong ( changing the reason they were refusing a refund !!).
negative	i have spoken to consumers direct who have assured me i am in the right and am_currently in the process of submitting a case to small_claims court .
negative	i would recommend that online shoppers do not touch this company with a bargepole as my experience with them has_taught me this .
negative	the proof of a company with good customer service is not in the prices on offer or how quickly things get delivered , but in how they deal with customer complaints - poor poor poor service ( a search of other online reviews demonstrates i '_m not the only one who thinks so ).
negative	i would give 0_stars if the review allowed it .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery because i needed my order quite urgently trusting i would receive it on the next_day or , latest , the day after the next_day given the fact that i placed the order in the afternoon .
negative	since there was no sign of delivery after three_days , i emailed them and they , only then , advised that what i requested was not on stock .
negative	they tried to deliver days_later when i was not at home to sign , so i had to go to the nearest post deposit to retrieve the package .
negative	very bad service considering that they even refused to refund the postage fee .
negative	that was my first time using getlenses and i am not impressed at all , i will go back to my usual , other online supplier , few_pennies difference but much more faster and reliable .
negative	thanks , for your reply lindsay .
negative	however , i did pay for next_day delivery , even because you offer free delivery on non urgent orders !!!!
negative	you are not perfect , i am afraid ...
negative	wrote a poor review of one of the barstools online but it looks like it has_been removed as it isn_'_t there !
negative	my family fortunately arrived sunday 00th_sept . in good time to park our car with looking0parking , as when we found their site , there was no one available to help us .
negative	the car_park was absolutely full with cars_parked at all angles and tightly_packed with no spaces at all .
negative	most were covered in dust .
negative	some other people were waiting for someone to turn_up , and they had been waiting 0 - 00_mins .
negative	after telephoning for transport to take them to the airport .
negative	we waited a while and then decided that the awful parking distance from the airport and general disorganisation was not good enough .
negative	we were worried that our car would be damaged and that we would probably miss our flight so we went to the official parking and paid £_00 .
negative	we didn_'_t see any vehicles coming away from the airport towards looking0parking and believe we would have definitely missed our plane .
negative	i gave looking0parking the chance to refund my £ 0 but they haven_'_t replied .
negative	we shall never use them again .
negative	be careful with this site , you can order an item which is in stock wait for it only to receive an_email a few_days_later saying item out of stock and a refund is being_processed .
negative	they should only sell stuff that really is in stock half of it isn . t .
negative	i had one very disappointed teenager after this !!
negative	!
negative	will never use again in case this happened again , i buy everything online this doesn_'_t happen with other_companies !!!
negative	!
negative	i am still_waiting for a refund that i was promised 0_weeks_ago that should have taken 00 days maximum !
negative	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
negative	i ordered , on the 00th_december , 0 bunches of flowers for a special_occasion .
negative	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
negative	the second bunch of flowers has never appeared !
negative	i sent countless_emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
negative	i finally got hold of someone on the 0th_january who promised a refund within 0 - 00 days .
negative	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
negative	i was then told it would be this week .
negative	i still_haven_'_t had a refund !
negative	!
negative	i am absolutely_furious , i am a first time customer and so far your ' customer service ' has_been diabolical from_start to finish !
negative	i will never use your services again , nor will i be recommending you to anyone i know .
negative	extremely disappointed as my family , in london did not receive their gift as indeed my aunt did not .
negative	she is just adapting to a place in a nursing_home up in the north of england and this delivery was really important to me .
negative	shame on the company who so readily took the money from my credit account , did not communicate any_difficulties and failed to deliver anything .
negative	to get a phone_call in the afternoon telling_me my daughter lived in a remote_area and you could not deliver her flowers was not acceptable .
negative	i often send her flowers and no one else has a problem delivering .
negative	if you could not deliver you should have informed me sooner and i could have made other arrangements . then to tell me i would get a refund within 0_days not good
negative	completely unsatisfactory as the flowers i ordered were dead and mouldy .
negative	they were sent to a friend after the loss of her father , which made the circumstances even more distressing .
negative	i '_m waiting for a resolution at the moment .
negative	firstly i had to chase my order .
negative	secondly i returned my item , 0_months later i still_haven_'_t received a refund .
negative	they haven_'_t logged off my return so even_though i have proof of return i am still without a refund !!!!!!
negative	firstly i '_m told i need to make a claim from the po when it was their postage_label i used then i '_m told that i should take it up with my credit_card company !!!!!
negative	what !!!!!!!
negative	are you mad !!!!!!!!
negative	any other company i have dealt_with sees a pop and promptly refunds customer !
negative	the company then takes it up with the po not the other way around !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	customer service is dire , emails aren_'_t answered , phone_calls are pretty_pointless !
negative	well if this sees the light of day i '_ll be suprised but no matter the www .
negative	is a great way to air ones grievances !
negative	having ordered a coat on the 00th_march the payment has_been taken
negative	still no coat 0st apr
negative	the web_page state i would recieve my order within two day only display items in stock
negative	the item was a present in which the date has long passed
negative	still none the wiser what '_s going on
negative	very poor service a bad_experience which will not be repeated
negative	i find the fact i purchased my mobile and they didnt give me my cashback i should have earnt they are obviously very decietful they promise something and give you nothing and before they try to say i didnt buy the phone i have the reciept for £_00 . 00 and the phone i will not be using this company again and will be advising friends and family against it
negative	if i could give no stars , i would .
negative	my story is very similar to paul and dawn below .
negative	i ordered on may 0nd and didn_'_t receive my summer house until july .
negative	they constantly blamed shires , who make them .
negative	mine had a b_& q sticker on it when it arrived !
negative	they told me " squires hadn_'_t picked_up the order " when i rang to ask where it was .
negative	even after that , the order wasn_'_t fed through .
negative	as they take the money the moment you make the order , i think they make their profit on the interest rather_than selling garden_buildings .
negative	when it arrived , one of the gables was damaged .
negative	i '_m trying to get_hold of squires but will probably resort to getting it repaired locally .
negative	i think they assume we will give up if we get no response .
negative	it '_s all very dispiriting !
negative	my experience with carhire000 has_been good up until this rental .
negative	but this time everything seemed to go_wrong .
negative	even_though i was told the second driver was included when i booked , this was not the case when we arrived and an additional_charge of euros00 was applied , plus_vat .
negative	we returned the car with a full_tank , but then euros00 plus_vat was charged to my credit_card after the hire to fill the tank ( again ?
negative	).
negative	i complained about this and waited several weeks , getting no response from carhire0000
negative	i tried to call repeatedly , but the office is open day - time only and the lines are very busy .
negative	on one occasion i held on for 00_minutes then got cut_off
negative	finally , i managed to speak to someone but it seems my complaint had not been processed .
negative	this was 0_weeks after i raised the issue .
negative	i have been promised a proper response within 0_days .
negative	fingers_crossed
negative	it does not do what i wanted .
negative	it does not pick_up the leaves on the drive and if it did not have the turbo option dread to think how it would operate .
negative	consigned to the garage .
negative	what a story .......
negative	exactly the same as many others , ordered , heard_nothing , got no response ......... then i wrote on this site ........ then got a response , agreed on a refund ........... returned item ........ heard_nothing again ............ 0 emails later ......,,,,, and again heard_nothing !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t care my phone case was £_00 .....,,,, i have had enough !!!!
negative	!
negative	i want my ££££ back !!!!
negative	!
negative	in nov i stated my family were solicitors and i was going to
negative	proceed with this case against nice cans , as from the weekend the case as been constructed and i will proceed to court in order to
negative	close this company down .
negative	i will update all events on this site !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a opinel knife for my dad for christmas the only one in the collection he didn_'_t have .
negative	the item came and was the wrong product !!
negative	with only one posting day left before christmas .
negative	i know i left it to last_minute but expect the order to be picked correctly .
negative	when i contacted them i had no response for 00 hour and then a reply_stating to buy the correct product again and they will try ( try !)
negative	deliver on time , then i needed to return the unwanted item for a refund ( postage would be paid by me ).
negative	i questioned if the item was not delivered on time and was told i could just return both , so no present for my dad and out of pocket !!!
negative	i ended_up buying from amazon at a later date and given him the knife as a token gift , even_though completely_useless .
negative	terrible service , i always try to buy from independents oppose to the monopolies such as amazon , but the service is just not there !
negative	avoid !!!!!
negative	!
negative	as a first time user of selectspecs and having read such positive_reviews , i was very much looking_forward to receiving my varifocals , fitted to frames i had sent in .
negative	although the frames and lenses were sent back within about 0_weeks , the vision on one side was blurry and i couldn_'_t use them .
negative	i sent them back and asked for a refund as i couldn_'_t use these glasses .
negative	since them i have received monosyllabic questions and replies via_email from customer_services every week or so .
negative	they suggest i go back to my optician for a re - test ( which my optician will only do at a £_00 charge which i can ill_afford ) or the will re - lense them for single_vision , which does not help me at all .
negative	i am over currently £_00 down and still have no glasses that i can use .
negative	this situation is still on - going and i still hope that it will be rectified satisfactorily some time before the year is out .
negative	but in the mean time , i do not recommend risking your money with this company nor will i use them again .
negative	plus de 0 ans que_je_suis cliente chez asos .
negative	et_je vois le sav se dégrader au fil des années .
negative	commande effectuée le 00 / 00 pour_une livraison annoncée le 00 / 00 ( option livraison 00h facturée à 00 €).
negative	rien reçu le 00 / 00 et quand je relance le sav via_facebook , j ' ai un gentil message qui m ' informe que_je serais tout naturellement livré le 00 / 00 .
negative	ils savent compter chez asos .
negative	quand je leur explique qu_' en raison de contraintes personnelles , je_ne pourrais pas récupérer le_colis et qu_' il me faudrait une redirection , un autre gentil message me répond : " on ne fait plus ça m ' dame " !
negative	bah oui , ils faisaient mais plus maintenant .
negative	merci asos pour tant d ’ efficacité .
negative	i order an ipad retina 000gb wifi and cellular on 00th_december via pay and collect ( not reserve and collect ).
negative	they took my money immediately of course .
negative	email arrived saying 0 - 0_days for delivery .
negative	no call by 00rd_dec to come and collect .
negative	this was a christmas_present .
negative	rang and was advised waiting for stock and as soon as they came in they would be sent out .
negative	this prompted them to then send an_email about delayed delivery .
negative	by 0th_january still no ipad .
negative	i rang and was advised there still was no stock and did i want to cancel .
negative	i replied no i wanted my ipad .
negative	an_email was sent to advise of my concern .
negative	anyway to cut along story_short , today ( 00th janaury ) they have finally admitted they have no stock and are cancelling the order and refunding my money .
negative	( they still tried to get me to cancel the order though because then they would not have been in breach of contract ) well that is simply not good enough .
negative	they have had use of my money for nearly 0_months .
negative	could you imagine if it had been the other way around ?!
negative	i have also spent hours emailing or ringing them , to say nothing of not having the use of the item !
negative	they are a complete disgrace and customer_services is a waste of space .
negative	i sent them my phone after they offered me £_00 , guess_what , i then received an_email_saying they had decided it was only worthy £_00 .
negative	the best of it was that the email they sent me very conveniently went into my spam email and because i never saw it or had chance to respond within their timescale my phone was then recycled and there was nothing i could do except accept the lower amount .
negative	do not use this company they rip you off as soon as they have your phone
negative	ordered these flowers for a special birthday , delivery was spot_on but the flowers were terrible .
negative	reasonably_priced but could have bought a cheap bunch anywhere that would have compared .
negative	never again .
negative	i have bought 0 x replacement bowls for kenwood kitchen machine .
negative	i received one bowl few_days_later and there was no invoice included .
negative	we sent email to as sufficient response to ask what was happening and received automated email few_minutes later reassuring that my issue will be look at by 0ourhouse . co . uk customer service .
negative	0_weeks_later and nothing has happened .
negative	i sent another email directly to 0ourhouse . co . uk , one month later no response .
negative	because i lost only about £ 0 so i am not interested to stress myself further than that so this is my response .
negative	very disappointed with this company and will definitely never order again .
negative	cheers to that .
negative	i bought via internet the freesia bouquet for my best friends birthday , but what she got was a different bouquet .
negative	the freesia one i picked was full of colors , today she sent me a thank_you note with a picture of the bouquet and it looked nothing like the one i had purchased for her .
negative	i am very dissapointed at this , for i was under the impression this was a serious service but i feel like i have been ripped_off .
negative	it is not really about the money , it is just that my expectations were not met at all , and it is not fair .
negative	i live far away and that is why i chose to use this service .
negative	never arrived although booked days in_advance .
negative	operator that i spoke to acted as if all in a days work .
negative	pathetic , really truly pathetic .
negative	recorded conversation and shall upload to youtube .
negative	pathetic .
negative	ordered on a friday , expecting the items by tuesday the following week .
negative	received a phone_call on tuesday , telling_me one item was discontinued but they did have the 000 pack available which i didn_'_t want , so cancelled the whole_thing .
negative	received an e_- mail saying they had cancelled it / refunded it and saying i should have gone for the other product which was better and same price !
negative	well if you had told me that on the phone i may have ordered it !!
negative	so used another company and it came the next_day !!
negative	!
negative	i have never_experienced worse customer service than with three uk .
negative	i paid for internet , and they couldn_'_t help me get it working .
negative	they kept telling_me they '_d send me the details i needed via_text , and they '_d never come through .
negative	i spoke with over 0 different people and all of them were unhelpful and borderline rude .
negative	now i asked for a refund , and they said they can '_t do a refund , but they '_d be happy to issue a credit to my account .
negative	they said their system can '_t process refunds ( which is clearly a lie ).
negative	i am just so frustrated - and am out the money i paid for a month , which is very frustrating since i didn_'_t even use the service !
negative	switching cell services for sure .
negative	kwik_fit phoned to cancel my next_day mobile tire fitting booking and asked to rearrange in three_days .
negative	expressed that this was unacceptable as i had a slow punture so they offered a refund in 0 working_days !
negative	explained that i would need the money to purchase other tryes .
negative	said there was nothing they could do so asked to speak to a manager .
negative	he was busy but was told he would phone me back in 0 minutes .
negative	half an_hour later he did phone back in which during our conversation he said that i had said that it was kwik fits fault that i had a slow_puncture .
negative	explained that i had said it was their fault but it was the reason_why i wished to have them changed quicker_than 0_days was told that they were not an_emergency service but i shouldn_'_t drive my car !
negative	upon further_discussion he agreed to phone my local kwik_fit ( which i would to drive too !)
negative	to see if they could take the booking instead and would get someone to phone me back .
negative	the next person from kwik_fit phoned and asked me how they could help .
negative	feeling upset and disappointed that my situation had not been explained to this new person i asked for a refund .
negative	at which point he said that he didn_'_t know what i was talking_about as this was the first time i had spoken to him and hung_up on me !
negative	updated phone from orange to ee 0g on advice of assistant .
negative	nice shiny_new phone .
negative	assured by assistant that i would still be able to get swapables on this new contract including sky sports as with my old orange contract .
negative	turns_out i can '_t .
negative	four telephone_call later still had no helpful resolution or advice from customer service department .
negative	tried five times to get through to the store ....... 0000 number to add , still nothing .
negative	my old option is to go to the store and have it out with them .
negative	i will contact consumer_direct tomorrow .
negative	they sold me a contract and phone not fit for purpose .
negative	the assistant lied to me twice that i know of so far .
negative	it '_s a shame as my previous upgrade with them was fine .
negative	very disappointed to say the least .
negative	i choose to order flowers from iflorist to be delivered to a close family_member on christmas_eve as a surprise christmas_present .
negative	i choose certain flowers as they had sentiment to the person that was receiving them .
negative	after_reading bad_reviews for iflorist i ensured that i emailed them to confirm the order i had paid for .
negative	yet after getting a phone_call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
negative	to my shock and disappointment i found that not only had they sent the wrong free chocolates but the wrong flowers completely .
negative	they seem to have provided me with a cheaper substitute to what i had ordered and it was pointless as the flowers were all the wrong_colour and not one of the flowers that were in the description for the product i purchased were correct , i am so angry that i choose to use iflorist on such a close relative to get flowers which have alot of remembrance of her late husband .
negative	i would have got better quality and have more pennies in my pocket by nipping down to garage and getting a bunch from there .
negative	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
negative	season of good will - clearly not at iflortist ... getting the order correct would be a start !!!
negative	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
negative	their restricted items list is so long , i am amazed they accept any parcels at all .
negative	they do not always collect or deliver on time , on several_occassions i have sat in and waited for them to either collect a parcel or deliver one , only to be left waiting for several days !
negative	if an item gets damaged at their depot , they will not return it , nore with the provide you with any evidence of damages , they will just destroy it , and all you will have from them as proof that it was damaged is ' because we said so '.
negative	they do not handel parcels with care , i have received parcels with foot prints on , and i have whitnessed the couriers throwing items about in the back of vehicles .
negative	its an appaulling service to start with , and the after care and customer service is even worse !
negative	avoid if you can .

negative	they break their own terms of use .
negative	they will not help you if a problem arrises .
negative	your item will not be handles with care at all .
negative	you can not send any item of any value at all .
negative	the restricted items list is longer_than your arm .
negative	they have a ' because we say so ' attitude .
negative	they treat their long_term paying customers like crap .
negative	if your parcel makes any noise they deem it broken and destroy it .
negative	they will not provide you with any evidence of any damages .
negative	they will not return your item if it is not delivered or damaged .
negative	they will fight against you tooth and nail even when they are in the wrong .
negative	do not expect any such decent service from this company at any time .
negative	' the customer is always right ' ???
negative	hell no , not to interparcel , to interparcel the customer is a piece of crap , just another idiot to give them money .
negative	beware !!
negative	!
negative	still_waiting for a reply 0_days_later , no phone support
negative	when i bought my fence 0_months_ago , my review read that delivery was excellent and product was good .
negative	only 0_months later and my fence is literally useless .
negative	it has warped and there are huge curly gaps between panels .
negative	i wrote to the company and sent photos 0_days ago and have heard_nothing back yet . the item purchased was 0x0 fence_panels .
negative	my verdict : do not buy !!!
negative	!
negative	or you may regret it later .
negative	wait_til someone_else is having a sale .
negative	very disappointed as on the morning the flowers were to be delivered they rang to say they couldn_'_t find a florist in the area to deliver as this was a delivery to my mum for mother '_s day it was too last_minute to do anything about getting her anything_else when you live away from family you rely_on these people to do the deliveries the girls excuse was they were very busy as it was mother '_s day i say they know that they are going to be busy and should get themselves organised i now have to wait up to 0days for my refund but as usual they took the money from my bank the second i placed the order overall very and all the girl could say was sorry
negative	so i '_m sitting at home waiting for the sky engineer to come today to install / activate my broadband .
negative	no sign of him so i ring sky .
negative	" where '_s my engineer "... silence ..." erm , he '_s not coming because there '_s a problem with your order ".
negative	me : " so why didn_'_t someone call to tell me ?
negative	"... sky : " oh the system doesn_'_t work like like that .
negative	we can only tell you the engineer isn_'_t coming if you ring us ".
negative	me ( jaw drops ).
negative	wtf ?
negative	you '_ve gotta be having a laugh ?!
negative	so the system can tell you that the engineer can '_t come but you can '_t let_me know ?
negative	yep , that '_s right .
negative	turns_out they entered my address incorrectly .
negative	now they have to cancel it ( it takes 00_hours ) before they can resubmit it for a new order .
negative	that will take another week .... ( breathe in ... breathe out ... repeat )...
negative	the lady_who informed me of this system , seemed quite indignant when i commented that it was the most ridiculous non working / waste of time system ever !
negative	and when i asked to speak to a manager , she wasn_'_t happy at all .
negative	but after i had to holding for about 00_minutes ( me paying for the call !)
negative	the manager profusely apologised for the way their system_works ( or doesn_'_t ).
negative	however didn_'_t indicated that this is a glitch - its ' simply the way it '_s set_up .
negative	unreal .
negative	unreal .
negative	amazon should definitely sack this service provider .
negative	arranged a collection almost a week_ago for today .
negative	all my paperwork states today '_s date as the collection date .
negative	when do they turn_up ?
negative	whilst i '_m away on holiday .
negative	when i emailed them about this ( no phone number available with a live person to speak with ) - explaining that today is my only day being home - what do they do ?
negative	complete ignore what i said - didn_'_t even apologise - and arranged recollection for next monday ( when i '_m working ).
negative	i emailed back saying that doesn_'_t suit me and today is my only available day so they should come .
negative	the response was that it '_s now been cancelled and that their systems show a different collection date .
negative	implying it '_s my fault and my problem .
negative	funny that the email that they replied to , was the confirmation_email from them with today '_s delivery date .
negative	what incompetent idiots .
negative	avoid .
negative	i bought my parents longacres vouchers for their 00th_wedding_anniversary and had to pay £ 0 delivery cost .
negative	i knew i couldn_'_t get to longacres before the party , so ordered the vouchers online .
negative	the vouchers that arrived were national gardening vouchers not longacres , which i could have bought anywhere .
negative	i ordered 0 voucher of £ 0 , £_00 , £_00 but got x0 £_00 and x0 £ 0 voucher .
negative	the £ 0 voucher is too long for the card it came in .
negative	the envelope was sign for but i '_m_sure it didn_'_t cost £ 0 to post through royal_mail .
negative	very disappointed with this service .
negative	my parents love going yo longacres to buy plants but following this i '_m not sure i would return .
negative	i will not bother with that website again and tell as many as possible
negative	i ordered from them on 00th_july , said i would eat my package between 0 - 00 days .. on the 00th after not getting it i contacted clear chemist and they said they would send me another package , after waiting a further 00 days i had simply had enough and contacted for a refund which thu gave_me .
negative	they obviously never sent me either package . i have never received them .
negative	no sorry , no customer service , nothing .
negative	worst company ever .
negative	i waited 0_weeks before having to call about my order and another 0_weeks to find out they hadn_'_t made my glasses yet .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	did not communicate unless i had to call them .
negative	needs lessons in customer_care
negative	service agents with communication difficulties
negative	fobbedoff all the time
negative	i ordered flowers for a bereaving family on 00 november for same day delivery .
negative	to date ( 00 november ), no flowers have been delivered and i haven_'_t even been contacted by eflorist to explain_why .
negative	i sent an_email ( only form of communication as they don_'_t show a tel no .
negative	on their site ) yesterday and a follow_up one today but still not response !
negative	my next action will be to contact my bank to reverse the charge ( which they had no_problems taking immediately ).
negative	ridiculous service in a very sensitive time .
negative	will never use again .
negative	trying to speak with talk_talk customer service is like sticking needles in your_own eyes while sitting in a vat of acid .
negative	i '_ve given up and have written to the chair
negative	sir charles dunstone ,
negative	talktalk telecom group plc
negative	00 evesham street
negative	london
negative	w00 0ar
negative	and suggest you do too .
negative	ordered a bed through wowcha .
negative	when it arrived several pieces were missing .
negative	despite several phone conversations and e_-_mails and four parcels the missing bolts were never received .
negative	we gave up in the end and bought the missing bolts ourselves .
negative	the staff were friendly during my conversations with them but unfortunately their promises didn_'_t mean anything .
negative	if someone had listened to me and checked the parcels contained parts requested the problem could have been sorted and i would be a happy customer .
negative	it is such a shame because the bed itself is just what i wanted but i think it is unacceptable to have to wait over a month for parts that never came .
negative	perfect iphone , absolutely no_problems with it , great condition .
negative	sent it off to zoomfish who then said it had scratches blah_blah_blah and reduced price to £_00 :((((
negative	not happy !
negative	!
negative	well what can i say 0 st time av ordered from you not happy at all the flowers looked nothing like your picture advertised i will_defo not be ordering or recommending you again it '_s only been a day and the flowers are already diein wish i could post a picture ther a joke !
negative	!
negative	after my mum recieved amazing flowers last mothers_day i used ure service again but the experience was totally different . the flowers came seperated rather_than as seen on the website and had to be put in the bin a week_later .
negative	so very dissapointed with the service .
negative	firstly the website : not user_friendly , search for something using the filters on ebay and you '_ll see how a big site should function .
negative	secondly the delivery : i '_ve had one delivery where they couldn_'_t find my house so kept trying to deliver it to another house on the wrong street .
negative	another time , the express next_day delivery i paid for was cancelled on the day and i was reduced to super_saver .
negative	talk about late notice .
negative	i was left without an important present .
negative	then it took_ages to arrive ( citylink dramas same old )
negative	finally customer service : talk about not what they claim .
negative	their call_centres are abroad and therefore explaining things is never easy , simply because the nuances of the problems are missed .
negative	they never actually answer_questions in emails or on the phone .
negative	they just skirt around the issues , unless you email the same questions more concisely three of four times .
negative	i know they ' re a massive company and they brand themselves well , but if you ' re one of the cases where it goes_wrong , you quickly lose any love you had for them .
negative	they ' re the same old dodgy corporation with a smiley_face on the box ( a bit like apple ...)
negative	these looked identical to the ones they replaced , site said they were compatible with my canon mp000 .
negative	after putting them in and finding they were not compatible i went on various_sites with instructions of how to get my printer to accept them to no_avail , got that fed_up of trying there now in the bin , total_waste of money .
negative	spent a long time looking for suitable flowers .
negative	what was delivered was very poor substitute - cheap flowers and wrapping .
negative	nothing at all like the bouquet i ordered .
negative	immediately sent an e_- mail to complain .
negative	still no reply 0_days_later .
negative	i will
negative	never use them again and do not recommend them at all .
negative	poor customer service .
negative	flowers where supposed to be held with water by the time they were received was no water left by the way they had been handled .
negative	i order this type specially so that they didn_'_t have to go in a vase !
negative	as for the flowers themselves apart_from waiting on lily '_s blooming the rest where very poor looking and i feel i would have been better off going to asda and getting a bunch much_nicer for half the price .
negative	won_'_t use this site again .
negative	i '_ve ordered over_£_000 of frontline for cats from you , last monday .
negative	i understand we '_ve had two bank_holidays .
negative	however , the business has had my money since monday and four full working_days to post my order .
negative	i rang customer centre today to chase the order - spoke to emma .
negative	she was very unhelpful .
negative	asked me for postcode and customer order number .
negative	in return gave_me no information back apart_from you '_ve had over 000 orders to process mines in there somewhere , could not tell me if it '_s been dispatched !
negative	i was advised i should get maybe sometime this week .
negative	not very good service or customer service .
negative	i '_m a registered tica cattery looking for a good realiable supplier for regular order .
negative	your the cheapest on the market , maybe this is why ?
negative	if the order doesn_'_t appear in the next few_days will be pursuing a refund and looking for a reliable supplier .
negative	i tried to buy the argos_voucher and at first it kept coming up saying i had already bought the offer , then i got an_email_saying i had left an item in my basket and when i went to look it was in my basket but with zero again how many i wanted .
negative	i could not change this and , therefore , could not buy the offer .
negative	order was clear and so was photo of product on website .
negative	ordered havainias brazil logo fushia 00 / 00
negative	received havainias slim 00 / 00
negative	no reply to my email to customer service
negative	order - e000000000
negative	ordered a light and a few hours_later the same product came on sale yet they cudnt say when i was ordering this
negative	on 0rd_october_0000 i made the unfortunate decision to purchase a pool / hockey / table_tennis_table from uk sports_imports as a birthday_gift for my fiancé .
negative	it was a great price and i had really looked around .
negative	my story is long and laborious and involves lengthy arguments with the customer service department ….. so i won ’_t bore you with the details but i will say this ……. my experience with this company means i will never order from them again !
negative	due to a mistake on their part , delivery was unsuccessful and they were ultimately threatening to charge me £_00 for failed delivery - completely denying that the fault was theirs .
negative	their customer service team were rude and unprofessional and completely talked over me and even more shocking was the fact that the customer service manager <_name_removed_> was even more guilty of this than the customer service representative <_name_removed_> …. i have to say i felt sorry for <_name_removed_> after_speaking to <_name_removed >…..!
negative	!
negative	i truly would not write a review like this unless i felt it worth warning others – i tend to write_reviews when i experience good service as there are a lot of people out there who are ready to write damning reports .
negative	however this is truly one of the worst experiences i have ever had when it comes to customer service .
negative	you may like to think_twice when ordering from this company .
negative	next time i will pay a little extra and by from a different company !
negative	!
negative	they take 0 - 0_weeks to refund you if they loose or damage your parcel , that is if your lucky_enough to get your money back !
negative	!
negative	i only used this company twice .
negative	never again !
negative	the first time i used them , they lost the parcel 0ft high !
negative	unreal !!
negative	which clearly_states on there site they have not delivered it and still have not refunded since 00rd_april when parcel was due 00 days ago .
negative	0nd parcel smashed to pieces and say i did not cover it properly !!
negative	even_though used bubblewrap / a towel and cardboard !!
negative	would never use them again ..
negative	i went to a0 to buy a birthday_present for my brother that cost over_£_000 and was shocked at the disgustingly poor level of customer service that i received !
negative	everyone from the receptionist to the sales people , were rude , ill - informed and totally unhelpful .
negative	they could not fulfill simple requests and when i asked for the delivery status of my purchase , without even taking my order number , i was told it in a rude , curt ' get lost ' tone that it would take 00 working_days .
negative	but how did the sales_rep even know what i ordered and when i ordered it ?
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t normally_write_reviews on websites , but this was by far the worst customer service i have ever received and so i felt_compelled to share my experience and warn other consumers to think_twice before they make their purchase from here .
negative	having bought six of the 0 x 0 featheredge pressure treated fence_panels , to fit into slotted concret post , i was totally_disgusted to find instead of the panel being as_discribed 00 mm thick , they are in in fact only 00mm !
negative	thick at the top rail ( which needed extra nails due to them being loose ) and only 00mm !!
negative	thick at middle and bottom rails which means i now have very loose panels which rattle excessivley in the wind - this must be a breach of trade discription !!
negative	!
negative	flowers were late , then delivered to the wrong house .
negative	quality of the flowers was ok but they didn_'_t last long as they had clearly been sitting in the courier warehouse / van for too long .
negative	i contacted the company to complain and they were initially helpful - promising a replacement bunch to be delivered in a fortnight as an_apology - great !
negative	they then retracted this the day before they were due to be delivered stating the house was now " outside the delivery area " ( extra 0 doors up the street obviously make all the difference !)
negative	and just issued a refund instead .
negative	laughably incompetent service !
negative	i took out a 0k loan in august_0000 , it was easy to get and i was very happy with the service .
negative	however , paying the minimum repayment each_month , i have paid £ 0000 in interest and now owe more than i took out at £ 0000 .
negative	it '_s really depressing and i can see no light at the end of the tunnel – will i ever repay or will i be paying interest for the rest of my life !
negative	?
negative	don_'_t do it !
negative	awful , tried to pay back my loan almost_immediately with a different card and was told i had to use the card i registered with . they ' re refusing my money ?
negative	i had to default on the loan and pay fees so the corrupt company makes more from my poverty .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	i phoned up offering them immediate payment .
negative	what ??
negative	is that even legal ?
negative	i have ordered bags before and had no_issues but recently ordered small paper_bags for a specific purpose .
negative	they arrived and were 0 . 0cm smaller_than described making them unfit for purpose .
negative	i asked if it would be possible to order the next size up and have the delivery charge waived as a good will gesture ( the postage is expensive for small orders ).
negative	this was denied and i was told that they had a ' tolerance ' for sizes and that i should have ordered a sample if the bag was for a purpose !
negative	basically meaning the sizes cannot be trusted .
negative	i was also instructed that to return the bags despite them not being as_described on the website , i would have to pay for postage .
negative	i am utterly shocked at such a short_sighted approach to customer service .
negative	i was likely to be a regular customer spending_hundreds if not thousands of pounds .
negative	added to this they then fail to respond to my final mail and send me a form to fill in about customer service !
negative	a surprise gift - flowers from next - had been sent my some friends who had been staying at our house .
negative	they had been delivered while i was out and a card put through the door with ' in greenhouse ' on it .
negative	now , for a start this surprised me as the delivery person had to go down the drive , past the garage ( the door of which was unlocked on that day ), through the back gate which is difficult to unlock , down the garden and into the greenhouse !!
negative	as i approached the greenhouse i could see immedately that something was wrong .
negative	the door was off its runners and the stopper mechanism had been pushed so far in the wrong direction that it had nearly snapped_off .
negative	i immediately contacted yodel who told me that it would be passed on and i would get call as a matter of urgency .
negative	four days went by , but nothing so i rang again - same response from the call_taker , but still no contact made .
negative	i emailed them - nothing !
negative	so i have now contacted a national_newspaper who deals in cusotmer services to see if he can help .
negative	in he meantime , my hubby has ordered a garden_shed which was delivered without the base supports that keep it off the ground .
negative	he has contaced the supplier and they are trying to get it sorted .
negative	the delivery company - yes , you '_ve guessed - yodel !
negative	!
negative	they used to be the place to go to if you wanted a last_minute holiday .... but now they ' re just as , if not more_expensive than a travel_agent .
negative	total_waste of time .
negative	limited hotels etc too !
negative	substituted an alcoholic beverage for one of a lesser quality , which if i '_d of bought elsewhere would have been £ 0 cheaper ... told me i could take it back to the store , which considering i was having a party and the order turned_up 0 hour before was totally un realistic .
negative	offered no compensation , said he would inform the store and that was it !
negative	never ordering from them again
negative	shipping can be delayed ... which is frustrating .
negative	cs don_'_t know a great deal .
negative	pestered me for 00p when i '_d set_up direct_debit which they accidentally cancelled - damaging my credit_score !
negative	said they would give me £_00 as compensation , and didn_'_t !
negative	not impressed ...
negative	i was very disappointed with mopp .
negative	they sent a young_man from indonesia who not only spoke little english , but had clearly never cleaned a home before .
negative	my husband patiently_explained the need for soap on oil stains in the kitchen , but when we came home to find the bathrooms dripping in water everywhere - with water stains on every tap and mirror - we decided we couldn_'_t be responsible for his entire training .
negative	mopp clearly does not vet its staff , but is large enough not to care .
negative	when i complained , and threatened to cancel my contract , they were happy to cancel my contract immediatey and made no attempt to make_amends .
negative	i '_m_glad to be rid of them and their dubious business model .
negative	money was taken and customer kept in the dark after 0 phone_calls decided goods were unavailable .
negative	really liked a sanderson design ashbee in antique gold after_seeing it in the sales locally .
negative	unfortunately , they did not have the king_size duvet - as colour discontinued .
negative	found out sandersons had other colours ivory or soft gold which would be great .
negative	searched online , found the colours and size at outlets which were miles_away but were unwilling to send them to me .
negative	i was directed to the online websit who only had it in white which i thought may be okay so purchsed but upon_arrival , found it wasn_'_t .
negative	i then find out that i have to pay the return postage which cost me £ 0 . 00 !.
negative	they don_'_t even give you a return_label !
negative	i thought recent legislation states states that online customers are not liable for the cost of returning goods .
negative	my complaining to bedeck was a waste of time , quoting that it is stated in their terms and conditions .
negative	found that is was , right at the very end by which time most people will have fallen asleep !
negative	( clever !).
negative	i shall be very interested to see just how long it takes for me to get my money back !
negative	in the first_instance i was led to believe i was getting £_000 for my iphone 0 , which was not that old a phone .
negative	once they got a hold of my phone it was only worth £_00 ... you guys will not be getting your hands on any more of my old_phones !!!!!
negative	!
negative	would not send me my purchase unless i sent my complete scanned passport .
negative	i ended_up having to cancel my order .
negative	from this advice :
negative	" i appreciate that you are going to be on an exchange in that case the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
negative	" the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
negative	to this :
negative	" yes , by going through the change of journey option .
negative	where you would change the ticket you have to a refundable ticket ( which you would need to buy )."
negative	had finished a phone_call where the conclusion was that i was to send back the unused tickets for a full_refund ( minus £_00 in charges ) only to be phoned back saying that was a mistake , and it would be a total of £_00 charges , along with me buying new tickets .
negative	consistently ignoring the information provided in the phone_calls and emails , like the fact that our outbound_journey dates had been changed .
negative	ongoing .
negative	our plain was delayed so instead of arriving sunday_night at 0pm we arrived at 000am on monday we had ordered and paid for breakfast so thought we would just use the room to have shower and have our breakfast before starting jurney home .
negative	when we got to reception the girl gave use the car key and said thanks .
negative	i told her we wanted to take shower in room as we didnt have to vacate until 00 and then take breakfast she said sorry breakfast was finished and i would have to wait for manager to come because she didnt know what room to give use as we hadnt had the room that was allocated , she was rude and unhelpfull we had paid for breakfast but she didnt even offer use a cup of tea .
negative	my partner and i had a fancy_dress_party to go to so we picked out two costumes and paid_extra for next_day delivery .
negative	when the costumes arrived they had sent completely the wrong product .
negative	after ages spent trying to get their " customer service " on the phone i was instructed the product ordered was not in stock ( thanks for letting us know !)
negative	and to go out of my way to send them back the wrong item by next_day delivery ( otherwise no refund !)
negative	the party coming up very soon i had to quickly pick out a different costume with the promise of next_day delivery .
negative	however the next_day having arrived and you guessed it no costume .
negative	below_par service on every_single principle a business should be run !
negative	my advice ?
negative	avoid !
negative	really liked the range of products that snowinn had , particularly in comparison to competitors .
negative	i ordered a jacket and was told it would be 0days delivery .
negative	0_days_later i was emailed to say it would be at their warehouse 0 working_days after i had ordered it .
negative	two_days after it was apparently due at their warehouse i was then told their suppliers couldn_'_t supply it and couldn_'_t say when it would be in stock .
negative	they were still at this time advertising the item on their website .
negative	the one thing they did well was to refund my money within 0_days of me requesting it to be returned .
negative	very sad overall as i had been looking at buying other things later from their site .
negative	ordered late wednesday_night for my sisters_birthday on the thursday ( always last_minute ) and she got them thursday_lunchtime and loved them !
negative	well she may have loved them but she didn_'_t pay for them and to be homest she was obviously just being polite !
negative	i asked her to send me a picture and the amount of flowers she had delivered is nothing more than a joke !
negative	completely embarrassed !
negative	next time inter_flora !
negative	least a few_pounds more you know you will get what u pay for !
negative	worst company ever poor customer service contacted 0 times never use groupon need to rethink who they reccomend
negative	dreadful place , would never order anything from them again after nearly 0_weeks of sending emails about my order and never recieving it because they never had been in stock .
negative	they replyed to hardly_any of my emails when i tried to find out what was going on .
negative	i asked for a full_refund and to cancel my order which 0_days_later they agreed with no apologies for any inconvenience_caused .
negative	i am now sat 00 days_later still_waiting to be refunded !!
negative	an absolutely awful company who have no customer service to speak of .
negative	do not order from laura_ashley they care nothing for their customers and cannot be bothered to email replys in a timely_fashion - i get far better customer service and efficiency when ordering from e_bay !!
negative	!.
negative	i would not even give this a star , i booked a collection in february and it did not come .
negative	having taken a day off work , it was a completely wasted day .
negative	a refund was given .
negative	i should have learnt my lesson but in march , i decided once again to use this company .
negative	and despite confirming on the day , the driver did not come to pick_up .
negative	another wasted day .
negative	i would urge that you do not use this service as it is the most unreliable service i have ever_seen .
negative	i had booked a convertible car to collect at pisa_airport .
negative	when we arrived to collect the car i was shocked to see the queues for cars .
negative	there was a ticket queueing system !!!
negative	the staff were all working hard but it tool us 0 hours to get our car .
negative	if sitting in a hot airport is your idea of fun then book a car at pisa_airport with auto_europe .
negative	most of the other_companies at the airport had no queues at all !
negative	when we picked_up the car there was no one on hand to show us how to use it .
negative	suffice to say we could not use the open top as we didn_'_t understand italian !
negative	not a good experience but a real damper on our holiday from day one .
negative	i wanted the perfect flowers and chocolates delivered , to cheer my daughter along in her battle with breast_cancer .
negative	the " country trug " filled with pale peach flowers looked just right for her , as did the lovely chocolates .
negative	i drove 000_miles to make a surprise visit within 00_hrs of the iflorist delivery and found that the flowers were orange and white , in a small woven basket , not a trug and there were no chocolates !!!!
negative	the delivery was at 0 :_00pm .
negative	i have lodged a complaint ( no telephone_number on website ) and to date have only had an_automated email reply .
negative	i am still_waiting for a proper reply and a refund of the cost of the missing chocolates .
negative	really bad service from yodel - waited around for my delivery that was meant to be on van and due for delivery but it was a friday so the driver went back and said no one was home .
negative	i had to arrange another delivery day without a card that was supposedly left by the driver on his fictional delivery .
negative	will not buy from sites that use yodel .
negative	waited in all day , checked online and lone behold it said my item had been delivered and signed for by me !
negative	can only guess the driver had signed for it himself and put it through the wrong letterbox over the road ?
negative	not good - resent using royal_mail .
negative	driver turns_up , waits outside , posts a card and then leaves without attempting to deliver - rubbish service
negative	i purchase some items for christmas_presents on 00 dec expecting delivering on 00 dec as specified on ebuyer website .
negative	three_weeks_later still no items delivered !
negative	overall , poor service and not no customer focus .
negative	i wouldn_'_t buy from this company again .
negative	i bought two wowcher deals for hot_water_bottles .
negative	when i received the vouchers i went on the website and tried to order them .
negative	there was an obvious fault somewhere along the line as it proved impossible to enter the wowcher credit number anywhere & i wasted almost an_hour repeatedly trying .
negative	i have since emailed wowcher asking for my money back as my order was placed & paid for in good faith , they have credited my account with a wowcher credit which is not what i want !!!
negative	they have since ignored all my emails and i have found their customer service skills absolutely diabolical .
negative	i will not be ordering from them again , hence not wanting the credit but my cash_back !!
negative	!
negative	man konnte sich nicht mal wo beschweren .. die 00 , 00 € sind wohl weg !
negative	please resend the box was damaged and the flowers bent , so disappointed when sent to my mother in law as been unwell .
negative	flowers i ordered as per picture - were not provided !!
negative	i basically paid over_$_000 for a vase and 0 bunches of fressia " s . i called and spoke to someone_who said they would follow_up and get back to me ..
negative	they did not .
negative	buyer_beware ....... do not use this company for on line purchase .. oh they offered me 0 pounds towards my next order .. yeah_right ...
negative	ordered flowers and then got an_email to say my order was booked and my flowers would arrive on time .
negative	got a phone_call on the date they were supposed to arrive , to tell me that there was a delay and wouldn_'_t arrive on time .
negative	if only they had told me earlier i would have arranged to buy flowers from somewhere_else .
negative	terrible service
negative	recently ordered jumpers and recieved i item when should have been two !!!!!!!!
negative	i have been left with no option but too return this jumper as customer_services sayn have too look into this # now my daughter who isnt well at moment didnt get her new year gift as item sent too_big and everywhere_else sold out of xs !!!!!!!!!!
negative	= very angry !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i bought michael mcintyre tickets almost a year before the event at wembley arena , and spent over_£_000 on 0 tickets .
negative	i was pretty annoyed when they came through with a face value of £_00 - £_00 each .
negative	i understand you pay the market rate for this sort of thing , but there is no competition - as far as i can see viagogo were the only option - and can therefore charge what they like .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again .
negative	i placed an order for flowers to be delivered to my goddaughter who was in hospital but she was discharged the day before the delivery date .
negative	i spent over 0 hours trying to change the delivery address but couldn_'_t log_onto the site and just kept getting emails from serenata with a link that i couldn_'_t use as it was greyed out and didn_'_t exist when i tried to key it in manually .
negative	i requested by email on numerous_occasions for a phone_call but didn_'_t get one so i emailed the alternative delivery address and it was acknowledged and i was told the courier would be notified .
negative	on the delivery day i had a text_confirming delivery .
negative	i spoke to my goddaughter who advised she had not received any flowers so i checked with the hospital who also advised they had not had any flowers delivered so i informed serenata by email and requested again that they phone me .
negative	i received email responses saying the courier had delivered and when i requested details of the recipient they did not respond .
negative	i pursued my email requests for a phone_call for 0_days and eventually obtained a phone number by ringing amazon_local and reporting my difficulties to them .
negative	i got through to serenata and spoke to several different people who said my details would be passed to the customer service team who would call me back as they were unable to transfer calls to that department from their phones .
negative	i have still not received any call back from serenata .
negative	this has_been going on for 0_days and i '_m not at all impressed with their .
negative	i cannot_comment on their flowers as i haven_'_t seen any but i would not recommend serenata to anyone .
negative	i won_'_t ever use anyone that does not advertise their contact phone number .
negative	i made a genuine error when booking and clicked on the wrong date .
negative	i realised as soon as the confirmation came back and contacted lastminute . com and asked for the booking to be transferred to the correct date .
negative	they told me they had contacted the hotel but that a transfer wasn_'_t possible as they were fully booked , despite the fact that there was availability on lastminute and other_websites .
negative	i therefore contacted the hotel_direct and the reservations clerk told me that he had spoken to lastminute that morning and told them there was a room available although i would have to pay an additional £_00 . 00 .
negative	he sent me an e_mail_confirming this which i passed_onto lastminute who still came back to me and said i would need to pay an additional £_00 . 00 which i refused to do .
negative	they eventually reconsidered and charged me an additional £_00 . 00 .
negative	to get to this resolution involved me making numerous_calls and taking on the issue myself .
negative	i did not feel like ladyminute cared_about me as a customer and i won_'_t be using them again !
negative	i ordered a collection for saturday , i waited in all day .
negative	nobody came to collect parcel .
negative	i complained by email , but didn_'_t even get a response , never mind refund .
negative	i '_ve had to make other arrangement for parcel .
negative	i got home from work on tuesday and a collection card been put through my door .
negative	to little , to late
negative	would not use service again
negative	i ordered a package and mistakenly chose the cheaper option of yodel to deliver it .
negative	they tried to deliver whilst i was at work , without telling_me and expected that someone was at home to sign for it .
negative	so i went online to rearrange delivery the next_day to my neighbours but apparently kitty litter requires the signature of the addressee only .
negative	so i go online again to arrange delivery on a saturday but according to their website they tried to deliver 0 times already ????
negative	and i now have to pick it up from their service centre .
negative	unbelievable .
negative	i would have to catch a cab to get there as i don_'_t have a car which is why i chose delivery .
negative	really disappointed and it '_s not the first time i '_ve been messed over by yodel .
negative	i won_'_t be using them , or any company that only uses their services again .
negative	not happy that i had to pay £_00 booking_fee for 0 tickets when the tickets were expensive enough as it was .
negative	not surprised to see the o0 wasn_'_t full despite what tv commentators said .
negative	lots of things im not happy with , flimsy , colour not as expected , panel screw_holes didn_'_t matchup , doors wont shut properly , half the screw_heads had nowhere to put the screwdriver , and person on the phone not really interested , haven_'_t got internet at the moment so difficult to keep in touch .
negative	very disappointed , and p . off spending a weeks wages on that load of tin .
negative	no point putting a lock on as i could pull the bolt of myself !!

negative	i recently_purchased a group on for a magazine subscription .
negative	i was sent a confirmation of purchase and assumed that was it but oh no !
negative	i failed to read ' the fine print '.
negative	i went off on holiday little realising that i should have sent a voucher directly to the company .
negative	i was three_days over the time when i came back but group on told me that as i had missed the date the voucher was invalid .
negative	andy the supervisor was called and i asked him how he could justify keeping my money - my problem he said !
negative	they would not give me my money back or let it be used towards another group on ( as some other_companies do ) they may as well have robbed me as they have my money for nothing at all .
negative	rogues do not use this company ever !
negative	i tried to order flowers over last weekend on various devices ( laptop , netbook , smartphone and work laptop ) and every time it froze when i tried to change the delivery date option .
negative	i was close to giving up when it finally worked .
negative	this is not acceptable when offering an online option .
negative	i won_'_t be using again .
negative	i ordered approx_£_00 goods a week_ago , i noted they do not dispatch items at weekends so assumed this would be sent on monday .
negative	therefore based on 0 - 0_days delivery i should have my items , but i don_'_t .
negative	i have used chemist_direct , boots , pet at home , pets supermarket , amazon , play . com , the hut , tesco direct , wilkinsons , thortons , hotel_chocolat , debenhams , marks & spencers , wallis , sports direct , & others & received better service .
negative	superdrug get your act_together before you become the next company to bite the dust !
negative	customers vote with their feet & will shop elsewhere .
negative	this company phoned me and said they were from google and that they were phoning me as my " free year '_s google period " is expiring .
negative	i specifically_asked if they were from google and the woman said yes and that they would extend my free period by two_weeks , i didn_'_t even know i had a free period ...
negative	i find out later this is all lies .
negative	after the sales rap i told them that i would not be entering into any agreement until the end of the two_weeks so i can see if the google site had any benefits .
negative	they have not ( funnily_enough ) got a recording of this part of the conversation and nor do they have a recording of the initial call where they say they are from google , they deny they even said it , looking at previous_reviews there is a pattern here as they have said the same thing to other people .
negative	they put the phone down on me when i tried to explain about this and their bullying tactics and the reviews that correspond with my report , how unprofessional .
negative	apparently they know all about the bad_reviews but keep on misleading people .
negative	anyway i have reported them to trading_standards for this and also fraud and misrepresentation .
negative	i would advise you to stay away from this company !
negative	i ordered some graph paper and my order was confirmed but then i heard_nothing .
negative	after emailing and ringing and leaving a message i still have had no response .
negative	it would appear they are ignoring me .
negative	i am utterly disappointed .
negative	i have nothing to show for the money that i spent .
negative	simply terrible !
negative	pants !! pants !
negative	!
negative	don_'_t touch " first_utility " they have taken 0 payments out of my account after i canceled it in febuary , i have been on the phone a number of times , waiting for hours , passed from one person to another , i sent an e_- mail , now they have changed their phone number and the message they have put out is said so quickly that it is impossible to make out , please read their ratings , it '_s disgraceful !
negative	i would urge_people to avoid using chemist_direct .
negative	dealing_with this company is an_absolute_nightmare - the very worst online shopping_experience i have ever had .
negative	i placed an order on november 0rd and still_haven_'_t received all the order .
negative	i have called and emailed which just resulted_in being_fobbed_off with excuses and assurances that my order was being dispatched immediately .
negative	in mid_january i bought a double solid_oak bed_frame from the dreams store in norwich .
negative	i wasn_'_t able to take it away that day as it was for a house i hadn_'_t yet completed on ( my first house purchase !).
negative	for a fee i arranged for someone to collect the bed on my behalf .
negative	i called the store to inform them of the time it would be collected ( to help them !).
negative	the bed was collected , and brought to my new house .
negative	i spent quite some time putting it together only to realise when i tried to fit the slats the wrong_size bed had been sent , i therefore spent my first night sleeping on a wooden_floor , which as you can_imagine is very uncomfortable .
negative	i went to the shop the following_day to request the correct bed was delivered to be told that it was out of stock and discontinued .
negative	the member of staff who i explained my situation to was incredibly rude , patronising , awkward and unsympathetic .
negative	he was not prepared to give me some king_size slats that i could use to finish making the bed without signing a disclaimer saying that the bed was non - refundable .
negative	instead he said he would arrange for someone to collect it the next_day and leave me without a bed for a minimum of four_weeks ( the length of time is would take to receive another bed ).
negative	this has caused me a great deal of distress and i will never ever be purchasing anything from dreams again .
negative	i will certainly my sharing my experience with friends and family and recommending they do not buy anything from there either .
negative	a totally disgraceful situation brought on by the disorganisation of this company ,
negative	i purchased 0 deals from this company before christmas and received 0 of them !
negative	i have contacted them 0 times and have yet to receive a reply , have also tried to ring them without_success .
negative	people need to be warned about this shambolic company .. will keep on at them till i either receive my goods or a full_refund
negative	avoid this company at all costs .
negative	they couldn_'_t find my work delivery address explaining there was no letterbox even_though company has a 0 man reception and a post room .
negative	i gave home address for delivery i called in the morning to check on delivery as not confident i would receive it , they had home address with postcode and work postcode , they were trying to deliver to work again .
negative	how when they couldn_'_t find it the first time round ?
negative	?
negative	dx now wouldn_'_t deliver to home address , i had to agree to go into work wait around for two hours and talk the courier to the location by phone ( why not call me the first time trying to deliver ?)
negative	dx wouldn_'_t even compensate by gesture of goodwill by refunding my travel expenses incurred by their admission of fault .
negative	will not use these jokers again .
negative	i ordered a number of items back in november .
negative	my money was taken out of my account within a few_days as they said the things had been despatched - they arrived a month later after much chasing !!
negative	the items that were not in stock had still not arrived yesterday and today ( january ) i have been told they are no_longer available !
negative	would not use again or recommend to anyone_else .
negative	the really sad thing is that the first time i used them they were fine which is why i used them this time - just to be rewarded with shocking service !
negative	i ordered toys for christmas_presents on 0th_dec_0000 the elc website said 0 working_days delivery .
negative	by 00th_dec still no show dispite chasing several_times !!
negative	they finally showed up on 0th_jan_0000 - which was 0_days after i had cancelled the order !!
negative	!
negative	order placed nearly a week_ago it '_s xmas_eve at 0pm and no delivery for my nephew ??
negative	furious to say the least !!!
negative	will never buy again
negative	why advertise olay anti ageing cream wash and post out anti wrinkle face wash .
negative	different product .
negative	didn_'_t you think i '_d notice .
negative	will note be using weldricks_pharmacy again .
negative	not happy .
negative	item was listed in stock .
negative	i spent my time giving them my personal_data , only to find out the item was not in stock ( in a subsequent email ), and they had no idea when it would be in .
negative	i now get an_email asking me to rate a purchase i would never have made if they had their act_together .
negative	cartridges damaged our printer , had to but a new one
negative	this company is awful .
negative	i waited over six_weeks for my order which never arrived .
negative	i then emailed them to enquire but no response .
negative	only after opening a dispute via_paypal did they respond asking me to wait another two_weeks !
negative	i declined and requested a refund which has still not arrived .
negative	i have escalated with paypal so fingers_crossed i will get my money back .
negative	companies such as this should not be allowed to operate .
negative	i was not aware that this company had such a bad_reputation until i read many other online reviews .
negative	they gladly took my money for the hire of a limo for my daughter '_s prom however , only when i called two_days before the event just to confirm that all was still ok with the booking , did they advise me that they are not able to honour the booking as they do not have a vehicle !
negative	when i asked the " customer service agent " said " it may have been involved in a car accident !".
negative	i was not happy with the explanation however my main_concern was to recover my money and to go to another , more reliable limo hire company .
negative	if you are thinking of hiring a limo , i would definitely not recommend this company at all .
negative	the medusa garment looked superb in the picture until i went to try it on and before i properly pulled the zip up the fastener came away in my hand .
negative	given the cost of this i would never purchase anything from escapade again as i now have to get a new zip fitted .
negative	as with others , i ordered the big_boy beanbag on 0th_november as a christmas_present for my daughter , delivery date of week 00 which has just been put back until week 0 !
negative	furious .
negative	very bad service !
negative	i am having the worst experience with cheap_smells .
negative	placed an order two_weeks_ago and still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	it was meant for a birthday_present and doubt they will be getting it .
negative	so annoyed hope i will get a refund asap !
negative	i immediately realised once i '_d placed an order late last night that i had put my own address instead of the intended_recipient '_s address .
negative	i emailed straight_away and rang first thing this morning only to be told that it was not possible to amend the delivery address as the order had been processed even_though the delivery is not going to be delivered until tomorrow .
negative	no room for error and no customer service - completely unsympathetic to what was a genuine mistake that could easily have been rectified given the fact that i had realised and informed eflorist immediately .
negative	thanks a bunch .
negative	i will not be using you again .
negative	what a crazy carry on over a mere booking that didn_'_t work out on 00march0000 .
negative	i booked a ryanair ticket stansted to karlsruhe online through bravofly , only to receive a jumbled email the next_day saying payment had not gone_through , querying something to do with my credit_card .
negative	alarmed , i phoned my bank , to find all absolutely fine with my card .
negative	phoned bravofly : first operator could not speak_english - i asked him to repeat , and then even to spell what he was saying , but even that made no sense .
negative	i phoned back : different operator , very thick accent , he simply kept_repeating my money would be returned in 00 days to my card .
negative	when i told him no money had been taken from my card , nor did i want any to be as i was cancelling , he spoke over me in a loud monotone voice , endlessly repeating " your money is freezin .
negative	money will return to you in 00 days .
negative	bank rules , not us .
negative	your money is freezin ...." on and on .
negative	i asked to be put through to a supervisor and he just kept_repeating on and on over me .
negative	final phone_call to bravofy and got charming woman with good english who told me payment had never gone_through because ryanair had upped their prices and bravofly could not get ticket .
negative	i told her previous 0 operators had been disasters , and she explained they are not able to refer a caller on .
negative	presumably that is why they insult the caller by endlessly repeating the same - incorrect message at them .
negative	my conclusion ?
negative	don_'_t go near such a poorly serviced travel company whose phone operators are clearly struggling , even to find out what has happened , never mind communicate it to the customer .
negative	remotecontrol didn_'_t work and cosme around £_00 . 00
negative	tracking order that was selected to be delivered today .
negative	said delivery was out for am slot and was delivered at 0pm .
negative	now 0 . 00pm and no bed has_been delivered nor any contact made .
negative	consignment numbers are as follows_:
negative	zwazea000000000
negative	zwazea000000000
negative	zwazea000000000
negative	zwazea000000000
negative	zwazea000000000
negative	i am constantly being told to change my details , confirming that the site isn_'_t safe . my account is inaccessible to me for the majority of the time i need it , i can '_t access my own money as paypal refuses to allow me to amend my own details .
negative	frustrating and unhelpful .
negative	i only use paypal as ebay won_'_t allow me to use anything_else !
negative	i bought a washing_machine and have had 0 engineers out to repair it , the first time they didnt have the right parts , the 0nd time came with no parts whatsoever and the 0rd time only fitted 0 of the parts .
negative	it went wrong again within 0_days of coming out with the same problem .
negative	it is over 00 days since the first call out and i should be entitled to it being written off .
negative	i waited in all day today for an engineer to visit as stated by the " written off team " and no one visited .
negative	i have been on hold for 00minutes each on 0 calls and am waiting for an engineer to visit on thursday .
negative	it will be another all day call .
negative	what a totally shambolic company .
negative	i wouldn_'_t bother with there warranty again .
negative	there quick and easy no_fuss guarantee is useless .
negative	call_centre aren_'_t in touch with the products being offered and i had to instruct them where to look on their own website .
negative	despite my efforts i nearly ended_up with two phones neither of which where on the correct tariff .
negative	tip_: go to carphone_warehouse and talk to a human_being .
negative	i ordered a bouquet , chocolates and a balloon for my mum .
negative	only the bouquet arrived and it was frankly rubbish .
negative	i have complained twice and am still_awaiting a response from customer service .
negative	having been a good customer for christmas and birthday cards i am very disappointed by this shoddy service .
negative	i would not purchase from the site again .
negative	misleading pictures that differ greatly from the product on sale .
negative	customer service , not sure this company know what it is .
negative	products seem to be reasonably_priced as far as i can tell , i spent over_£_00 to get the free delivery .
negative	this is where the problems all started .
negative	so far i have been waiting 0_weeks for city_link to deliver .
negative	this is not_necessarily precious_little one '_s fault , but they have not tried to rectify the situation - they merely asked city_link to redeliver , which is what city_link appear to have been doing , but no delivery attempts were made .
negative	i have asked plo to use an_alternate courier and re - despatch as city_link were clearly not making the delivery but i haven_'_t even had a response from the last 0 emails to plo customer_services .
negative	i wouldnt recommend this company .
negative	first_utility never transferred my accounts from the old supplier , yet still charged me for a whole new bill with them .
negative	i then got bills from my old electricity and gas suppliers .
negative	obviously i complained and cancelled my direct_debit with first_utility .
negative	first_utility didn ; t cancel my direct_debit though , so it went out for four months .
negative	i then tried to get a refund , they claimed they had transferred the account from the old electricity_supplier , i contacted the old electricity_supplier , and they said never_heard of the transfer .
negative	this is now a year later , they are still not refunding me the whole amount .
negative	as for compensation ?
negative	frustrated .
negative	the cheapness of their offers , has cost a lot .
negative	update , finally i got my full_refund + some compensation .
negative	brilliant , you might think but wait , no , a bill arrives today for an overdue energy account of £_000 . 00 , energy accounts that never existed , even a year and a half ago , when i did try to join first_utility , with all the associated trauma that went with it , unbelievable
negative	the machine i ordered was missing the advertised disk of songs .
negative	when i phoned , thinking they would simply send a new disk i was told that it was impossible for the disk to be missing but that they would check and get back to me .
negative	they have not contacted me or responded to my subsequent_emails over several weeks .
negative	this was to be a birthday_present for my 0 year_old daughter .
negative	i have asked to return it under my statutory_rights ( distant marketing directive ) and because not as advertised .
negative	the company is just refusing to respond to me at all .
negative	i would definately not recommend them
negative	my husband and i booked what was supposed to be a two week holiday in portugal , however due to thomas_cook '_s lack of attention to detail and disgraceful lack of staff knowledge , we ended_up in one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in , in spain !
negative	we '_ve fought with them for compensation since may and have finally had to admit defeat , accepting a miserly payment of £_000 for a holiday that cost us in excess of £ 0000 .
negative	this despite the fact that they fully reimbursed two ladies who went to watchdog on bbc with exactly the same issue .
negative	obviously i should have done this but i mistakenly believed that , after admitting that it was their mistake , they would treat us fairly .
negative	i have never been so wrong in my life .
negative	one thing though is certain - i will never book with them again .
negative	i placed an order for 0 sets of flowers to be delivered to 0 separate addresses and they stayed in all day and nothing has shown up , not even an_email to say will be delivered at a later date nothing would not recommend
negative	members of family party booked resorthoppa for transfers from bodrum airport to turgutreis ( large resort about 0_hr from airport ).
negative	driver couldn_'_t find drop_off house or pick_up locations (' uncle '_s ' restaurant in centre of turgutreis - everyone_knows where it is !).
negative	on return transfers to airport they were nearly an_hour late for first pick_up and 00_mins late for second - no help from phone numbers .
negative	no apology from either driver for lateness and they were surly and rude .
negative	all in all v stressful and i can_honestly_say the worst service we have ever had in turkey ; shame on you resorthoppa .
negative	i received a different outfit than i ordered and when i phoned customer_services i was told i would be sent an e_- mail with returns details including a number .
negative	an e_- mail has not been received so thus_far i have been unable to return the goods .
negative	the costume was ordered for an event which i will now not make .
negative	miss k young
negative	due to ill_health i cannot currently visit my local_store .
negative	i made four online orders and i am still_waiting for refunds from each order for items not delivered or for substitutions !
negative	i clearly_marked do not substitute with ....... and yet three of the orders did exactly that !
negative	additionally i was charged for items that were out of stock !
negative	there was no offer of a substitution , i did not say no or send the alternative back , they didn_'_t send anything and yet i was charged and i am still chasing the refund as the driver has not ' notified ' them as yet !!!
negative	!
negative	i received items with 00 hr shelf_life , milk that was off , and the birthday order for my mom had no flowers and no substitutions !
negative	00 days_later i need to pay my credit_card and yet i am owed £_00 of refunds !
negative	i have called several_times to be informed that refunds take 0 - 0_days , so why 00 days late am i still_waiting ?
negative	the drivers are lovely but the rest of the service fails completely !
negative	i am so fed_up chasing that i for one will rethink visiting any waitrose or john_lewis store again !!
negative	!
negative	item stated fast delivery , i chased 0_days_later to find it still_hasn_'_t been sent , no explanation , just ' i '_ll chase_up and send as soon as possible '
negative	i only ordered as it stated ' fast delivery ', it will be a minimum of 00 days so definitely not fast and that '_s is the minimum time period i can expect !
negative	00 days is a long time when your waiting for a physio therapy item to assist with a ' speedy ' recovery
negative	i was already disgusted with this company as they failed to deliver my order on 00nd_january and didn_'_t respond to my complaints until 00th_march .
negative	however , my disgust has only increased after finally seeing the flowers which were delivered to my friend yesterday .
negative	most of them were dead on arrival ( and there weren_'_t very many altogether anyway ), and it looked more like a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol_station than what the picture suggests it should turn into .
negative	i will now do my utmost to make_sure that no - one i know gives a penny to this company - i am ashamed to have sent my friend such an awful ' gift ' for her_birthday .
negative	after having booked a holiday to florida with my daughter and 0 grandchildren to celebrate our 00th_wedding_anniversary , my husband was diagnosed with cancer i emailed the hotel to see if i could get an electric_scooter delivered direct to the hotel to help him get around , the hotel was great no problem they would see to it and looked forward to seeing us in august , imagine my surprise when i got a email from the hotel to say sorry we had cancelled our booking ( we hadn_'_t ) contacted alpha_rooms who apologized and said they had changed supplier but all was now ok .
negative	emailed the hotel back and was told there is no booking for you , contacted alpha_rooms again kept on hold for over 00_minutes there is not a problem the booking is confirmed , emailed the hotel still no booking showing for us , i have rang alpha_rooms again on hold for over 00_minutes at premium_rate , i asked for a call back to confirm everything was in order sorry i have 0 customers in a queue cant call you back well sorry is not good enough i am stressed enough without all this , customer service is appalling , unable to understand the indian service advisor very broken accent , stuck as have paid money and leave in 0_weeks we just wanted a break with our family before my husbands surgery , sort your act out , you should be ashamed of your total_lack of service , i have contacted hotel to see if we have a booking or not i am_disgusted with you
negative	failure to accept my account of events and trust placed in delivery service .
negative	furniture was as ordered . most dissapointed by the fact that the delivery guys did not
negative	unwrap it .
negative	i am a wonam of 00 and told me all i had to do was stand it on its head .
negative	they would not help me and i had to pay to get done by someone_else .
negative	i therefore would not order from you again .
negative	once again received an_email_saying item on way and then an_email requesting feedback but not actually received my order !
negative	every item i have ordered has not been delivered on time or when it was arranged for .
negative	once received items are excellent but because of delivery problems i have bought other items elsewhere , paying a little more but with quicker availability and efficient delivery .
negative	hopefully won_'_t be much longer before i receive the two outstanding products ,
negative	totally pissed_off with this company , as have been waiting over 0_weeks for my order and their only response is to carry on waiting .
negative	hi ,
negative	i would like to say i am fed_up of transactions taken by pay_pal and then
negative	having to phone branches for an explanation .
negative	if these goods are not available then they should not be advertised .
negative	i have had three cases so far this week were goods were no_longer available even_though payment was made , i have also waited day '_s for confirmation of shipping
negative	before contacting branches .
negative	it is annoying when you could have bought these goods elsewhere and got them .
negative	cash_generators offer goods at a fair price , it '_s a shame the service could match that .
negative	bought this item on line as needed for a very important job in 0_days time .
negative	they emailed after i had paid to say it wasn_'_t in stock .
negative	it didn_'_t arrive until after the job was completed .
negative	i needed to be informed before i bought it that it was not in stock so i could order elsewhere .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	like so many of you , i ordered my bigboy beanbag as a xmas_present for my kids .
negative	i thought i '_d left plenty of time as i put the order in through_groupon on 0rd november .
negative	needless to say there is still no sign of the bean_bag despite my delivery date being changed 0 times and groupon '_s assurance that it would be delivered by 00th_february .
negative	so far , any contact i have had with the company has_been contradictary and insincere about the impact they have caused .
negative	i have never_experienced_such a lack of professionalism or apparent concern for their reputation from any company .
negative	i was livid when i opened the box and saw how little there was in there , and i bought it at a sale price of just over_£_00 .
negative	i priced the sweets individually at the big supermarkets and you can get the lot for just over_£ 0 .
negative	this is a real rip - off , save your money .
negative	i will not be shopping in this place again !
negative	sadly i can only give them a 0_star_rating because 0_weeks_later , i am still_waiting for a response from them .
negative	here is my experience so far with them ...
negative	i ordered on the 0st_november_0000 and my parcel came on the 0th_nov , the box was damaged with a big hole in it and the gravel bag that was in it had burst_open and half the gravel was missing and it had poured all over into the courier car !
negative	they use yodel and yodel hands it over to a courier to bring it to me , why they do this ?
negative	i have no idea , i hate yodel , they are the worst delivery company in the uk .
negative	anyway , i immediately emailed pet_supermarket about it and once my form was sent it says ' we will be in touch within 00_hours ' ....
negative	so i waited and waited .
negative	it was eventually the 00th_nov when they replied to me asking me to send them the photos i had took as evidence when it arrived so that they can confirm the fault , begin an investigation and go_ahead with arranging for another to be sent out to you right away .
negative	i did this within an_hour of them responding to me and it is now the 00nd nov and i have had nothing back from them .
negative	its simply not good enough .
negative	they use a 0000 number so im not going to keep ringing them , it will cost me a small_fortune !
negative	they wanted pictures anyway so an_email is the only way i could do that quickly .
negative	its the fact i am still_waiting to hear from them that is totally_unacceptable and once ( or should i say if ) my problem gets sorted i will be sending in a complaint to the company about very poor customer service , no_doubt it will take them weeks to send me a bog_standard ' sorry ' email .
negative	they aren_'_t a bad company for getting stuff posted and they are a legit site , its just the fact that this is my first experience using them and its not taking 00_hours to reply like they say its looking more like 00 days !
negative	i wont_be using them again , id rather pay extra money and know my complaints , if any , will be dealt quickly and efficiently .
negative	i think i will end up ringing them in the end to see what on earth is going on and why i haven_'_t had a response from them .
negative	my problem is still ongoing over 0_weeks from my first complaint .
negative	its really not good enough so if you order from them and have a complaint then expect to be in for a very long wait if you email them !
negative	even if they are extremely busy , they should have an auto response set_up simply saying that they have the email but they are busy and they may take a while to reply to you ...
negative	i wouldn_'_t be so annoyed or fed_up with them then !
negative	i made an enquiry about sizing of an all in one , not a purchase and you have not got back to me so assuming you are not a legitimate web_site
negative	have used dairy crest / milkandmore for years , pleased to support the traditional doorstep milk delivery .
negative	system only works when the regular milkman delivers .
negative	always goes up the creek when he '_s on holiday or sick .
negative	always .
negative	this morning we had someone_else '_s delivery and not our own .
negative	tried to ring local_depot , as i have done before , only to find local numbers no_longer work and you have to ring one central dairy crest call_centre number .
negative	and where '_s that ?
negative	in manila in the phillipines , as it turns_out .
negative	how crazy is that ?!
negative	charming_young_lady kept me on the phone for 00_minutes - and it '_s not a freephone_number - after telling_me she couldn_'_t give me the number of the local_depot or their email address ( because that was only for internal use !)
negative	unable to deviate from her script , causing me to spell and re - spell our address , postcode etc as she didn_'_t understand them ; putting me on hold while she needed to ' refresh ' her system ( oh , what a surprise ); and then being unable to do anything except tell me that she would inform the local_depot of my call .
negative	huh ?
negative	hello !
negative	i could have done that myself if i had had their local number !!!!
negative	when she attempted to put me on hold for no_doubt another lengthy time i told her that i was cancelling my order forthwith and would be getting my milk in future via my supermarket grocery_shopping .
negative	the charming mask rather slipped at that point .
negative	it '_s your_own fault , dairy crest / milkandmore .
negative	you are squandering the goodwill of customers who are desperately_trying to support you .
negative	having a call_centre in manila is crazy - we need to talk to the local_depot , not some script - reading robot in the far_east .
negative	when you consider how much more_expensive your milk is than that from the supermarkets , i fear your days are numbered .
negative	oh_yes , and what '_s more , i shall be pursuing the cost of that 00 minute phone_call when i get my phone bill - i was blatantly kept on the line ( as i see other_reviewers have mentioned too )
negative	so far from very , on three different occasions
negative	no stars greenpod , i have used this compay before without_any problem for laser_printer_ink .
negative	i liked their green credentials , so last month i ordered a rainbow set of inks , paid by paypal ( thank_goodness i did ) no ink ever arrived and even after_contacting the company via_email they did not respond in any positive manner .
negative	their phone no voicemail was always full so i could never leave a message .
negative	i needed the ink for my business so had to order from another_supplier .
negative	fortunately , after raising the issue with paypal the payment has_been refunded .
negative	sorry greenpod , such awful service for you will mean i never order from you again .
negative	if i lived in a remote rural_location it might make_sense but a mile from the city_centre ?
negative	they won_'_t collect from or deliver to us but this didn_'_t stop them from accepting a booking from an ebay_seller i bought from recently .
negative	now i have to wait wile they return the item ( no explanation given ) and the seller has to wait in and book another courier .
negative	i have tried to book them in the past only to be told they don_'_t come here but knowing how awful they are i won_'_t make that mistake again should they start .
negative	hermes is not a proper courier company , they seem to be an_absolute shambles so even_though they tend to be the cheaper quote it '_s not good value for money .
negative	if you really want to spend less there is collect_plus , you have to drop it off at a local shop so the savings are passed on to the customer , and stuff actually gets there !
negative	we are waiting for 0 reading_festival ticket which is for thursday but its tuesday and no sign of delivery .
negative	there is only an_automated_voice at the end of the phone line and no reply to e_- mail , my daughter is heartbroken that her ticket doesnt look like it will arrive .
negative	why cant there be a person at the end of the line who can help us ?
negative	what can i do ?
negative	as an update viagogo phoned tonight to offer a refund as the tickets will not be delivered .
negative	we are grateful for that but now have to try to find a ticket elsewhere .
negative	i ordered a goodmans digital recorder that when it finally came i found that the remote did not work ( i tried a friends remote and found that it worked with that one ) and when i contacted the company they said that it was up to mighty_deals to sort and mighty_deals are just ignoring me .
negative	this has now been going on since october_0000 .
negative	secondly i have paid for voucher for a set of 0 swan saucepans with a 00 piece cutlery_set but when i try to place my order they are trying to charge me another £_00 for the cutlery .
negative	supplier has ignored me and mighty_deals seem to be taking ages to sort this for me .
negative	i have been in touch with mighty_deals over the last month ( since 00th_march ) but so far although they have promised to send me a remote_control nothing has arrived and as far as the 00 piece cutlery_set goes i have heard absolutely nothing .
negative	mighty seals are a total_rip_off
negative	i ordered the flowers for my sister '_s 00th_birthday - a very special_occasion .
negative	they arrived two_days late .
negative	not what was promised by iflorist !
negative	also , it lost the element of surprise as i phoned her and asked if she liked her present .
negative	not good enough for me to use the company again , or recommend to friends or family .
negative	on the 00th_april i ordered 0 nars products from hq_hair .
negative	its now the 0th_may and they have only dispatched one item .
negative	i have sent emails to them however they can '_t tell me when the items i ordered would be in stock .
negative	if they didn_'_t have the items in stock that should have been made clear on the website .
negative	there generic emails are also really unhelpful .
negative	really , really annoyed .
negative	i ordered flowers on wed 00st_march for my parents - in - law 00th_wedding_anniversary on saturday 0rd_april .
negative	in short , no flowers have turned_up .
negative	i have tried - on the saturday and on the following_tuesday ( monday was a bank_hol ) - to contact them , and have a constructive discussion via their on - line chat_facility , and via_email ; i also requested many_times that they ring me , and asked for details of the florist .
negative	all i encountered was a stonewall - my questions were ignored ; they suggested that the flowers had arrived ; they prevaricated , and offered no constructive points at all .
negative	i have sought legal_advice and spoken to the trading_standards office .
negative	this company is in beach of contract , and , under contract laws , i am now entitled to a refund and compensation ; i will pursue this and take to the small_claims court if_necessary - then they will end up having to pay costs as well as possible a higher compensation amount .
negative	these people are thieves , and should not be allowed to continue trading .
negative	absolutely_disgusting .
negative	never again , and i will spread the word about how bad they are .
negative	i am also extremely annoyed by my employer who has this company on their staff offers site - did they not check iflorist out first ?
negative	from mid_february i was trying to start this account but they get wrong my bank details and after 0_months they corected and they charge a lot for the time when i could not use the account and i close the account in may ..... baddd
negative	turned_up in a brown box , no nice packaging there were hardly no flowers , i could of gone to any high_street shop or supermarket and got more for less_than a fiver .. i am a idiot for using you services .
negative	never received order .
negative	absolutely useless .
negative	will never use again or recommend to anyone .
negative	i would rather lick piss off a nettle .
negative	good breakfast and soups good for lunch .
negative	loved the snacks .
negative	evening meals disgusting mainly .
negative	was hooked into two months and should only have to do one month .
negative	i dread teatime and prefer hospital food .
negative	very disappointed expensive experience !
negative	would not recommend to others .
negative	feel conned by reading others reviews !
negative	ordered my bean_bag on 0nd nov , was told 0_weeks delivery , then go pushed to week 00 and now pushed to week 0 , now at the end of week 0 another nothing has arrived ...
negative	tried_emailing , no replied , no phone number to actually talk to anyone !
negative	waiting 0_months for a bean_bag is not acceptable and no communication or even a simple apology and explanation , no to mention no keeping customers up to date on their order
negative	will never buy from infurn again and am telling the world not to buy either
negative	we booked a trip to paris and sadly we made a mess of the booking .
negative	we booked the wrong date !
negative	this was spotted straight_away so we called the customer service team to see if we could get this changed for a week_later .
negative	we had incidentally booked 0 quality rooms in a nice hotel .
negative	well !
negative	i spent 00_mins trying to get through a language_barrier to get the person to understand my dilemma .
negative	eventually we have up i am still_waiting for another person to call me back - we '_ll see ???
negative	but incidentally i stand to lose £ 0000 really because we can '_t understand each other !
negative	i don_'_t consider my self to have either a broad or colloquial accent .
negative	so sorry ebookers - need to drastically improve your customer service
negative	i ordered flowers at 0 . 00 . later at 00 . 00 i discovered i had sent the wrong delivery address .
negative	i immediately emailed with the correct_address as i had been advised the flowers would be delivered the following_day .
negative	there was no phone number but a promise of a one hour email response .
negative	next_day at 0 . 00 i received an_email_saying the flowers were being prepared .
negative	at 0 . 00 another email said they had been left in a shed at the original wrong delivery address .
negative	i had given no instruction to leave in a shed .
negative	a very poor service as i have had no respnse to my emails at all
negative	i am still_waiting for full delivery .
negative	so far i have had 0 seats arrive without legs and then 0 sets of legs appear .
negative	i am still_waiting the final 0 chairs .
negative	communication is very poor and i found it almost_impossible to actually get to actually to talk to anyone .
negative	i would not recommend or use in the future .
negative	i purchased a coffee and side table which took almost 0_weeks to be delivered although they took payment the minute the order was placed .
negative	on receiving both of the above after numerous call re delivery i may add , i received the goods but minus several parts to build the coffee_table with .
negative	i had to phone umpteen times only to be promised they would be sent out first_class_post the following_day but to no_avail .
negative	i eventually gave up and threatened to cancel the order and request a refund and goods to be uplifted , only to be given another long_drawn_out story about short staff etc and the missing_parts would yet again be sent out first_class_post ..... guess_what they never arrived next_day but five days_later !
negative	had i not been out of the country this company would have had a very nasty phone_call from me and a request to uplift their goods and refund my money .
negative	i have spent extra pounds on the calls , let_alone the stress of not having the goods purchased , which i may add were not cheap .... did i receive any compensation or refund of delivery costs ?
negative	no , a follow_up call to see if missing_parts had been received ?
negative	no .
negative	i purchase a lost of goods online and i must_say this is the worst customer service i have ever had .
negative	i would stay clear of this company and will never use them again .
negative	i brought the disposable high_strength cigerret to see if i wood enjoy them better then the nicolites but didn_'_t enjoy it at all , it was like breathing freash air and after 0_days of not a lot of use i might_add it ran_out and that was that .
negative	i '_ve since tried vip stater kit and the are brill and will tell anyone who_wants to listen .
negative	i '_ve spent a fair bit of money on finding the right type for me and i like and enjoy a cigeret and i '_ve found them , just not the disposable safecigs
negative	avoid using orange !
negative	signed_up for a one month rolling_contract sim only - ( carphonewarehouse has confirmed this ) but orange still refuses to cancel contract stating i signed_up for 00 months which is incorrect .
negative	despite 0 hours on the phone , they refuse to cancel .
negative	bad_experience do not use orange !!
negative	!
negative	i also called customer service saying its been over a month and told me they said they '_d send me a form to fill out .
negative	never receive the form .
negative	terrible service .
negative	in january_0000 a bottle of tesco_finest fresh orange_juice exploded all over my kitchen within an_hour of buying it splattering the ceiling , walls , units and pile of ironing with orange_juice .
negative	i claimed against tesco for redecorating and produced the offending bottle .
negative	another new bottle of which the cap was also at great risk of exploding .
negative	a set of photographs showing damage_caused and a decorators quote for £_000 .
negative	on the 00th_october_0000 tesco admitted liability stating the £_000 would be in my account within ten days .
negative	by the 00th_december_0000 it still had not been paid and tesco continued to say - the payment is still being_processed .
negative	which year are they actually intending to pay the debt they owe me ?
negative	first time customer , i ordered a toilet_pan and basin and fixings , however the basin was out of stock and wouldn_'_t be in until the 0th_august .
negative	i am doing full bathroom renovation and going on holiday at the end of august so could not wait on the basin coming into stock as i had to arrange plumber etc and it wouldn_'_t leave me enough time to complete before holiday
negative	promptly called customer service and cancelled full order due to out of stock item , lady very helpful and said will pass on to accounts to refund .
negative	0 dys later , no confirmation of refund , customers services say its not instant and can '_t tell me when it will be done
negative	they are very quick t take payment but i am now £_000 . 00 out of pocket and cannot get them to refund this anytime_soon .
negative	very close to calling my bank and telling them the situation and its not authorised transaction and the police also as its now fraud for keeping my money ...
negative	a very unhappy customer and will not be using ever again ....
negative	had faulty goods sent out .
negative	took a while to get the issue sorted .
negative	wouldn_'_t use amazon for an enemy '_s presents , wouldn_'_t buy anything from them again .
negative	buy cheap buy twice !!!
negative	piss poor customer service .
negative	i have booked the collection / delivery by parcel0go .
negative	i called to ask when would be the collection time as i need to go out on the day just for an_hour .
negative	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
negative	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .
negative	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .
negative	this means that nothing has_been done to cancel the order . the agent on the live_chat was quite rude , too .
negative	very frustrating !
negative	waited in all day for items that were out for delivery .
negative	check tracking around 0 o ' clock to see that apparently delivery was attempted and a card was left .
negative	well both is a lie !
negative	in future will not be buying from any company that uses this courier !
negative	useless !
negative	unacceptable service .
negative	waiting on refund for a suit which cost £_000 .
negative	emailed over three_times took a week for a response which basically states some rubbish about high email volumes and the email received showed no interest or_inclination to look into or deal with my query .
negative	just basically states it takes 00 days to issue a refund and i should contact them after this time period if not received .
negative	this does not give me any confidence in their service what so ever .
negative	now made a complaint and waiting on some response from topman .
negative	i do not understand how other stores refund within a matter of days and retain good communication with their customers other than topman is holding_onto my money to gain interest on it !
negative	warning to all avoid topman !
negative	!
negative	thieves they take your money you need to pay 0 to 0 times more and call_center hhhhhhhh no words for their disgusting behavior . lesson never ever go for eon
negative	we want arrival of new product .
negative	omer cayman et roller speargun .
negative	i make fabrication for spear gun
negative	i am in need of that part for spear gun .
negative	i purchased a knife_set through_groupon , the money was taken from my account the next_day and after a week i checked my parcel status which said ' out for delivery with courier ' i then checked back later to find it had said ' not delivered - damaged item ' i then straight_away emailing groupon asking when i would receive a new one , to be told i wouldn_'_t as the deal had ended .
negative	beware - you may be buying something but if its damaged on delivery ( through no fault of your_own ) then you will not receive it or a replacement just a refund .
negative	this is appalling as i ordered deal straight_away , paid , to then be told you cannot receive another is horrendous when i didn_'_t receive even the damaged item in the 0st place !
negative	have not received my products ordered , been going on several months , no response to e_-_mails or letters , these people cannot be contacted by telephone .
negative	trading_standards are now involved but i doubt i will ever get my money back .
negative	please do not order anything from this company .
negative	update - ( may_0000 ) - one year on and after recently talking to the victorinox uk distributor i received a telephone_call from the owner of swisstool and a subsequent refund into my bank_account .
negative	this is the worst estate_agents on the planet .
negative	stay away you have been warned they stole £ 0000 from me without my consent .
negative	never approach this estate_agent i have contacted the police and watchdog .
negative	stay away
negative	joined this site last_week and placed hundreds of bids and never won anything .
negative	other_reviewers are correct its rubbish .
negative	not very reliable at all
negative	be warned some of the tickets that they say are available are not !
negative	very deceptive .
negative	i hate this site it took me ages to choose my buy my groceries .
negative	the site is not well_laid_out , not very user_friendly .
negative	some of the items that where delivered where damaged like the eggs and the yoguart .
negative	they also have a restriction on mineral water_bottles , they are very mean .
negative	if i could , i would give this company 0_stars .
negative	first of all , i received no invoice whatsoever upon initially placing my order on the 0th of april .
negative	several weeks_later - 0 , to be exact - i sent them multiple emails asking where my glasses are .
negative	they responded , eventually , saying that the lenses had gotten broken at some point after production and they were having to start from scratch .
negative	they offered a measly_£ 0 refund on my delivery charge - the order totaled over_£_000 - for what was already a ridiculous wait and was now going to be even longer .
negative	i questioned yet further about when i would finally get my glasses as i had no spares and relied on them being delivered .
negative	after talking to a representative for around half an_hour , absolutely nothing was sorted_out , " at_least two more weeks " was all i was told , and i have asked them to cancel my order .
negative	at this point , i am left without_any glasses , without my money , just angry and disappointed .
negative	i have not had my order yet .
negative	i have text emailed called but still nothing .
negative	avoid .
negative	random paperbag designs are 00_% christmas logos ... how can i use them ....
negative	i made a booking with ebookers after having read the positive_reviews .
negative	it said the booking had gone_through and that i would be receiving a confirmation_email shortly .
negative	next_day no confirmation_email so i called them .
negative	apparently there was no record of my booking whatsoever !
negative	yet they were holding money from my account .
negative	after 0 phonecalls to them and several hours of being on the phone between them and my bank there was still aparently no record of m booking whatsoever .
negative	i explained to them that they must have my bank details and my name and address to be able to hold payment from my account .
negative	an_hour or arguing later , they magically found a record of my booking but apparently it had not gone_through .
negative	i asked them why not as my bank had told me they did not stop any payments and they kept telling_me they did not know why but the payment would ' fall_off ' within 0 - 00 days and i could rebook then .
negative	i told them this was not good enough as the prices of the flight had already gone up £_00 .
negative	they told there was nothing they could do and they could not even match the price of the flights .
negative	i said this simply was not good enough as i was now having to pay an extra £_00 because of their incompetence .
negative	i was told i would receive a call back within 0 - 0 hours .
negative	my partner in this time rebooked at the higher price as he did not want it to go up even more and he wasn_'_t aware that they had already charged the account and they had no record as he was at work and so was i !
negative	he just thought it had not gone_through .
negative	it went straight through even_though there was less money in the account so i do not understand what the problem could have been in the first place .
negative	four days_later i have received no call back .
negative	i wish we had not booked with them at all .
negative	if this is what is happening before we '_ve even taken off , what can we expect from the holiday ?
negative	maybe they do it on purpose so customers end up paying more .
negative	oh and they also charge you £_00 to pay by debit_card and £_00 to pay by credit_card which they don_'_t show you till you reach the end page !
negative	they then also after you '_ve booked tell you baggage check in is not included so you have to pay on top for that .
negative	it '_s just one thing after another .
negative	i '_m temped to report them to watchdog because i don_'_t really understand what kind of show they are running here .
negative	i am still_waiting for that call back .
negative	last_year i joined a new company and i was ordering all supplies including stationairy .
negative	in order to cut costs i decided to start buying toner_cartridges from ebuyer as their prices seemed the most reasonable .
negative	it was alright a first till i ordered what they described as the ' brother dr0000 drum_kit 00 , 000 pages '.
negative	the description clearly_stated : ' this brother_dr - 0000 black_cartridge is compatible with the hl - 0000dn and hl - 0000d printers .
negative	the dr - 0000 can print up to 00 , 000 pages .'
negative	on the back of this description which leads you to believe the cartridge is included , as it did not say ' this brother_dr - 0000 drum_kit ...' i ordered the item in_advance as our hl - 0000dn was beginning to run_out of toner .
negative	when the toner did need replacing , i opened the box to find it is just the shell that holds the toner !
negative	no cartridge included .
negative	i double_checked the description and called ebuyer as the description clearly said ' this brother_dr - 0000 black_cartridge ...' having a legal background i know the importance of proof and therefore took a screenshot of the desciption page .
negative	i spent so long on hold being passed from one person to another .
negative	even their sales_staff agreed and apologised that the description confused me but told me i should have called them to clarify .
negative	now , i found out the next_day that the call had in fact cost me £_00 !
negative	is that why they want us to call and clarify , so they can leave us on hold and charge bsurd rates ?
negative	anyway , i asked to speak to a senior_member of staff .
negative	again i spent_ages on hold .
negative	i explained the situation to this manager who kept telling_me i had ' assumed ' and i should have called to clarify .
negative	i had asumed nothing , the description clearly_stated : ' this brother_dr - 0000 black_cartridge is compatible with the hl - 0000dn and hl - 0000d printers .
negative	the dr - 0000 can print up to 00 , 000 pages .'
negative	not ' this brother_dr - 0000 drum_kit ...' i told her if it was just the drum it why did it not say ' this brother_dr - 0000 drum_kit ...' she kept_repeating herself telling_me i assumed and i should have called to clarify .
negative	i was getting_nowhere and wasting my time so i asked how i could make a complaint .
negative	she gave_me an_email address .
negative	now , as soon as i got off the phone , i refreshed the page and they had chaged the description to say ' this brother_dr - 0000 drum_kit ...'!!!!
negative	i took a screenshot .
negative	by this time i was fuming .
negative	clearly if the description was not confusing and misleading , and there was no room to misinterpret it they would have left it as is !
negative	i called again ( not knowing how much that call had already cost me ) and again i spent a lifetime on hold .
negative	i finally got through to the same woman and asked her why they had changed the description as soon as i got off the phone .
negative	she kept saying again i had assumed that it would come with the cartidge .
negative	she would not give me a straight answer .
negative	i gave up and thought i will email a complaint to the email address she had given me as clearly i was getting_nowhere .
negative	i emailed a complaint to the email address they had given me and i am yet to receive a reply over a week_later .
negative	the next_day i found out from my boss that the first call alone had cost us £_00 !!!
negative	that '_s why they keep you leaving on hold and that is why they called to clarify .
negative	i then emailed another complaint to the same email address as i was not going to make the mistake of calling them .
negative	again , still no reply .
negative	i will not be buying from them ever again .
negative	we have since started ordering cartrudges from elsewhere .
negative	the prices are not worth the hassle and end up costing you more if something_goes_wrong .
negative	i am seriously_considering making an official_complaint against them .
negative	i had used lastminute before and recommended them to friends for their reasonably_priced hotels .
negative	however on this occasion i made the mistake of booking a top_secret_hotel for my boyfriend '_s birthday .
negative	i rung them to get some help but the operator could not even find the hotel on my screen for the price that was showing on the dates .
negative	i asked for the rough location [ ironic ] of this hotel but wasn_'_t allowed to be told .
negative	i gave up on the phone and decided to book the hotel online , only to find out this 0_* top_secret_hotel was a holiday_inn .
negative	devastated , because i couldn_'_t possibly take my bf to a holiday_inn for his_birthday [ hardly romantic ] i rung them up the second i got the email which would mean that the booking was still being_processed .
negative	i was told this is non - refundable .
negative	i asked for an explanation as to how a holiday_inn in one of the worst areas in london is a 0_* top_secret_hotel only to be told these ratings are from a person from lastminute who goes to the hotel .
negative	told it was non - refundable .
negative	the command of the english_language from their operators or managers is not great .
negative	can '_t afford another hotel after forking_out £_00 .
negative	thanks for ruining my boyfriend '_s birthday .
negative	won_'_t be using them again .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	my friend need cheering_up and the message was forgotten , no card and her name was spelt wrongly .
negative	she didn_'_t even know the flowers were from me .
negative	she guessed , luckily !
negative	i appreciate the flowers were sent from the uk to holland but if you type the details on line , not really sure how it could go_wrong .
negative	would '_ve complained but actually couldn_'_t be bother - at_least they got there at the right time which is the only plus point really
negative	i would rate only ' zero '.
negative	i had placed order for more than 00 pounds on 00th_december_0000 and i haven_'_t yet received my order .
negative	i am informed that they despatched my order on 00th_jan and it has not yet arrived .
negative	i will ask for a refund if i don_'_t get my order by the friday .
negative	their customer service group never attends the call .
negative	i will never ever buy anything from these_guys .
negative	i booked a car through rentalcars for a holiday with my daughter and
negative	grandson .
negative	at the time , we requested a child car_seat .
negative	although the small_print stated that this was not guaranteed , rentalcars did not even pass the request onto the car_hire company .
negative	when we arrived at the airport , we had a car but no car_seat ( the car_hire company showed me the booking from rentalcars to them , and there was no request for a car_seat ), so i could not legally drive with my grandson .
negative	after three hours (!)
negative	of trying to get through on the phone to rentalcars and many , many discussions , we were able to change our booking to another car_hire company , and get a smaller category car and a car_seat .
negative	rentalcars do not accept that anything was their fault and will not refund the difference_between the two car categories to me .
negative	when i email them , i get a standard email answer , totally missing the point .
negative	when i call them and ask for their manager , i am always told he / she is busy .
negative	when i ask for his / her name , i do not get it .
negative	very bad customer service .
negative	ordered christmas_present for my daughter ; didn_'_t arrive .
negative	emailed miss selfridge three_times on 00th / 00th_december ; the only response i '_ve received to date was an_automated_reply asking for tracking no .
negative	which i '_d already given them .
negative	rang three_times on 00th / 00 dec ., first time couldn_'_t get through , second time got through to recorded_message and was then cut_off after ten_minutes or so .
negative	third time spoke to someone_who couldn_'_t really care , said it was the carrier '_s fault not theirs , and said she would process a refund for goods but nothing for telephone_calls unless i sent a statement .
negative	took me about three hours in total to get this far .
negative	now i '_ve received a refund for the goods less the carriage , so i '_m £ 0 . 00 plus cost of calls out of pocket , not to mention the time and effort_involved , and the disappointment of not having a christmas_present for my daughter .
negative	will never deal with them again !
negative	i ordered the first time from asda online groceries with a two hour delivery slot 0pm - 0pm today .
negative	waited for two hours , just about to give up and the delivery man knocks at the door .
negative	my items are on the path , an electronic device is thrust into my hand .
negative	sign the box says the delivery man .
negative	i signed , this is my first delivery from asda .
negative	he rushed off , not surprised as he left me with substitutes that left me short on pocket and what i '_d ordered .
negative	tried three_times to sort_out the problem with customer_services who are rude , unconcerned and barely audible , don_'_t know where their call_centre is based .
negative	basically i have lost out but decided never to deal with this company again and i would rather pay more for my groceries and deal with professionals .
negative	lesson_learned , will never recommend to anyone .
negative	order the correct code but key doesn_'_t work
negative	ordered a christmas_tree on friday 0nd november , i had carefully read the terms on the website before placing my order and it clearly said that the tree would be sent the next working day or if there was any delays that i would be notified by phone or email .
negative	i waited_until the following_tuesday ( 0th_nov ) to call the company , they told me that the tree was out of stock and that it would be back in stock and would be out to me within the week .
negative	to cut a really long_story_short , i called them again another two times to be told there had been further delays and that the product would be sent out to me soon .
negative	by the 00rd_november i was sick of waiting and being ' fobbed_off ' with excuses and i cancelled the order after three_weeks of waiting .
negative	i asked for an_email to be sent to me confirming that the order had been cancelled and to date nothing has ever came through .
negative	it would have been nice if the company had actually contacted me and made me aware of the delay at_least once throughout the three_weeks , instead of me having to call them numerous_times .
negative	i have never received such a bad service from an on - line company and will certainly be avoiding them in the future !
negative	the colour ink_cartridge you sent me for the dell photo 000 isn_'_t printing properly .
negative	it hardly works at all on normal paper but on glossy photo_paper the top half works but loses all the warm colours as it goes towards the lower part of the page
negative	despatch e_mail received on the 00 th april for photographs and photo_book large order so a lot spent .
negative	still_waiting for delivery so can not comment positively did not expect to have to wait this long . used other photo sites in the past and had a lot quicker delivery .!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a spa overnight_stay at carden park for may_0000 .
negative	paid £_000 for 0 of us to go , only to receive a call from shirley at lastminute stating that the deal did not exist and that i needed to change the date for spa package .
negative	no mention of a refund initially .
negative	i called following_day and asked for a refund .
negative	00 days_later , still no refund .
negative	i had even called lastminute . com 0 mins before the online booking and confirmed that there were 0 rooms available at the venue .
negative	yet , in those 0 mins , all 0 rooms had sold out ( 00 :_00am !!!)
negative	i spoke to hayley , sharday and another rude_woman .
negative	all said i needed to wait 00 days for it to be processed .
negative	then i discover that they had not bothered to put refund through as they couldn_'_t refund back onto america express .
negative	no phone_call in 00 days to say this .
negative	i then get told by hayley it would be paid in my bank as soon as finance guy ( kumar ) comes in to the office , at 0 . 00pm , still no refund .
negative	i call and they tell me that it is processed and will take 00_hours , even_though i have waited long enough already .
negative	i get a call from hayley five mins later , she took down my card_details incorrectly and refund never been done even thoughh girl 0 mins earlier said it had already gone though , eventually after 00 days , i get my refund of £_000 back after 0 phone_calls , shocking customer service from girls who couldn_'_t care less about helping_me , one kept putting me on hold so she didn_'_t have to listen to me !!
negative	!
negative	basically the spa deal never existed , carden park declined it because they had no rooms , so why take my money when deal doesn_'_t exist .
negative	dodgy company , would never use again .
negative	everything about this experience points to bad practice and working under - hand and certainly false deals / advertisements .
negative	terrible !
negative	the flowers should have been delivered on 00mar but were eventually delivered on 00 mar
negative	i requested in the order to ' leave them on the door_step ', you left them with a neighbour .
negative	somebody , not ' the neighbour ' delivered them yesterday ( 00 mar ).
negative	the impression was that yodel '_s driver came to the end of his shift , didn_'_t deliver them at all on 00th and only delivered next time he was in that area .
negative	your text_messages to keep me up to date were worthless .
negative	there was no water left in the container and the flowers looked ropy and 0_days old
negative	i tried to call you on 00th and 00th_march , nobody picked_up the phone .
negative	my only way to communicate with you is via this trustpilot email .
negative	look_forward to hear how i am going to be compensated for this terrible service
negative	( flowers went to boss '_s wife - hugely embarrassing !!!)
negative	expect a telephone_call from a senior person with explanation what happened with this order .
negative	also expect another flower arrangment to be sent to mrs whitehead free of charge and one to me for the inconvenice .
negative	awaitng your comments please !
negative	bought some ' compatable ' epson_ink - all went well for a couple days , now printing isn_'_t possible as cartridges aren_'_t being ' recognised '.
negative	compatable ?
negative	i think not !
negative	what a waste of time - nothing offered so went on ebay in the end to get the part .
negative	it would appear that jaguar parts are not well catered for with this service !
negative	i will not bother next time !
negative	i buy a lot of clothes and food from marks and spencers .. no more !!
negative	i wore it once and noticed the sleevs are tooshort , almost as though the heat from me makes them shorter !.
negative	hey refused to give me a refund and said i must have long arms !.
negative	the customer service mamager could not even be bothered to come and speak with me even_though i asked twice and wanted to show it on me .
negative	this is the exeter store ..
negative	i will never shop again and i spend over_£_000 . 00 a month in the shop .
negative	they obviosuly can_afford to lose valuable customers in this economic_climate !
negative	my order was delivered with drooping flowers , buds that were going brown and a pathetic number of flowers that were bulked out with loads of branches .
negative	if you dare to complain , they won_'_t_believe you unless you email photos as proof .
negative	unfortunately my 00 year_old mother is not tech - savvy so customer ' service ' refused to take any further_action .
negative	do yourself a favour and order elsewhere .
negative	my delivery never turned_up on the scheduled date .
negative	customer service was very difficult to get through to and when i did eventually , promised to call me back and failed to do that .
negative	i eventually got through to sales and i was promised a call back again and they failed to do this again .
negative	i was not provided any explanation or call back but received a text_message_stating the delivery would be the following_day .
negative	this was inconvenient as i have arranged to take the day off work the day before and therefore , had to take another unpaid day off work !!
negative	the goods where good value for money however to date i have still not received and call back after sending 0 written emails :-(
negative	way back in early march i ordered a piece of furniture .
negative	after two promised attempts of delivery the furniture did not arrive .
negative	after several appalling attempts of apologies i gave up and cancelled my order .
negative	achica owe me £_000 which i still have not received .
negative	if you want to be robbed , misery and grief , then go_ahead and use this atrocious attempt of a company .
negative	i am unable to give a positive_review as i feel let_down and very disappointed .
negative	upon placing my order i was informed that it would be unavailable for dispatch for two months , this was undesirable but agreeable and expected before christmas .
negative	it was only a month and a half later that i was then informed that it would not be delivered before the new year in the middle of january .
negative	this has put me in a predicament , which could of been avoided if levels of organisation and customer_care within the cotsworld company were at a satisfactory level ; in this time i could have had the product designed and built from scratch .
negative	needless to say i would advise others to take their delivery estimates with a pinch of salt .
negative	refer to your email 00 - 00 - 00 you were unable to provide my order .
negative	therefor i am unable to comment on your service .
negative	thankyou
negative	i paid for paulo nutini concert ticket which , according to their website would be delivered no later than 0_days before the event by registered mail
negative	two_days to go & and no sign of ticket .
negative	tracking the booking reported that it had not yet been despatched ,
negative	rang them - us number , to be re - routed to a uk office !
negative	( god_knows what my phone bill will be !)
negative	a frustrating 00mins - to & fro , being refused name of a manager etc , i was eventually told that i had to meet the ticket seller at the venue to get my ticket .
negative	this was not mentioned until i hassled to get info about getting my ticket
negative	i was then obliged to contact seller myself to arrange meeting , fingers_crossed this seller exists and has my ticket !
negative	.
negative	no way to run a business
negative	have gradually discovered that this is a very unfair and bias site
negative	i never received the print cartridge which i ordered , yet payment was deducted from my account !!
negative	i contacted customer_services before the 00th_december_0000 however to date have not received a response .
negative	very very disappointed .
negative	order number : pl - pi0000000 [ 00000000 ]

negative	it started off when my partner took my car to simply have a tyre changed .
negative	as i was a self_employed horse rider i didn_'_t get much of an income so went for the cheapest tyre available .
negative	when the tyre was put onto my wheel , it was not inflated .
negative	this is because - quote from an employer of kwik_fit - they don_'_t inflate it until it is on the car .
negative	0 employers then tried to get a walnut key onto my alloy and all failed .
negative	they then even got a hammer and tried hammering my wheel off .
negative	they all agreed it would be better to leave it as they didn_'_t want to wreck the chassis but luckily my step dad could put it in for me .
negative	however what all 0 qualified employees failed to notice was that there was a nut stuck in the key already .
negative	so at this point i had paid £_00 for a flat_tyre .
negative	then due to bad_luck , my other tyre had blown leaving me with no car to get around and earn my wages as again i was self_employed .
negative	i contacted kwik_fit mobile service and a lovely gentlemen came out and sorted_out the recently blown tyre quickly and efficiently , with the correct walnut key !
negative	when i told him about the flat_tyre i was given he was also in complete dis belief that they had a left 00_yr_old self_employed girl with a flat_tyre .
negative	luckily he sorted the tyre out with no more fee of charge and fitted it too .
negative	thankfully this kind gentlemen had restored a little faith back in kwik_fit for me .
negative	however , when i disputed this with head_office it took a very long time to get back to me about what they were going do .
negative	they offered me a £_00 refund and that is all .
negative	when i asked about the wages i had missed out on or the mot i had to pay for that of course my car failed as it was on a spare , he merely said a insincere apology and that is all .
negative	all in all my experiences with kwik_fit was incredibly disappointing and i will not be using their service again
negative	the flowers did not arrive so i was very disappointed !!
negative	i found it impossible to get any feed_back about what was going on and have yet to hear what the company will do to put it right .
negative	i order my very 0st order but have as refused my 00_% 0st order discount , after 0 telephone_call at my expense and 0 complaints the poor_excuse i was given is that i didn_'_t qualify for it as i ordered a sale item .
negative	no where on the website or adverts does it say that the 00_%_discount on first orders doesn_'_t apply to sale items .
negative	made one order and cancelled my account straight after .
negative	wouldn_'_t recommend !!!
negative	!,
negative	i returned a faulty remote_control to them on 00 mar_0000 but have still yet to receive the refund to date , despite chasing it twice .
negative	i will be claiming the money back from my credit_card company
negative	great product but customer service really needs looking at .
negative	would never give these people my money again .
negative	i had used viagogo last_year to buy lady_gaga tickets .
negative	0_days before the event i received an e_- mail advising the seller couldn_'_t provide the tickets .
negative	the day before replacement tickets were sourced .
negative	stressful but okay .
negative	have now booked p ! nk tickets for manchester 00 / 00 / 00 and with 0_days to go it has happened again but this time they have not responded about replacement tickets .
negative	i have sent 0 further messages with no contact and am so worried that the hotel rooms and 0x train_tickets are going to be a waste of money , on top of the extortionate price of the tickets already purchased .
negative	will never use again and would suggest others stay well clear !
negative	trans id_0000000
negative	ok if you haven_'_t got the idea by now , do not use ecar !!
negative	unfortunately i didn_'_t have the foresight of these reviews !!
negative	to cut a long_story_short , i took out a policy with them , within about 0_weeks of starting the policy we too got bombarded to submit proof , which was done by email and confirmed at the start of the policy !
negative	then they decided to put the price up , by £_000 !!!
negative	at the time i did not have enough money to chance insurance providers so had to continue with the monthly_payments which started at around £_00 , later rising to £_00 . 00 , then we were told that we would be getting a refund taking the monthly_payments down to £_00 then another letter to say no , sorry , your monthly_payments will remain £_00 . 00 .
negative	ok so grumble grumble we carried on paying .
negative	then when we moved to a better area , with driveway , cul - de - sac etc i contacted ecar to change the details ( needless to say i haven_'_t rung them once as their call charges are just unrealistic !)
negative	you can do changes online and it gives you a quote .. so proceeded to do this , to find out that an additional £_000 would be required to make the change !!
negative	( not including the standard £_00 odd change to policy fee ) so i decided to get quotes from elsewhere .
negative	having done this i found a quote for £_00 per_month !!
negative	i therefore cancelled my policy but of course the online quotation wouldn_'_t say if i would be owed or if i would owe money .
negative	however , having paid the monthly premium on 00th_october and being a months payment in_advance and my policy ending on the 00th_october i presumed ( stupidly ) that i would be getting money back from them and the premium would cover the £_00 cancellation_fee .... ooo no .. like getting blood from a stone !!
negative	i '_ve now received a letter saying i owe them £_00 . 00 and to call their £ 0 . 00 per min number to make payment !!!!
negative	absolutely fuming ..... needless to say i am now going through all the paperwork and will be making a complaint to trading_standards or the motor ombudsman ( if there is one !!)
negative	absolutely atrocious !
negative	also non of my correspondence has ever had a reasonable reply , only directed me to their website !
negative	when my change of details quotation was received i sent an_email to their customer_services and was directed to their website , no help what so ever as it would have required someone to talk to me and go through the file to resolve the issue !
negative	!
negative	total con .
negative	waited months for orders to arrive ............ when one did was awful ....... sent the bag back ............ no refund .
negative	still_waiting for refund and second order ........ what compounds the issue is i paid nellypot p_&_p and extra £ 0 for what i '_d thought would be a lovely bag !!
negative	! they were having a laugh and this has made me much wary of buying kgb & groupon deals
negative	ordering was easy and the package came quickly
negative	i ordered a lovely bunch of flowers for my nana for mothers_day on friday 00th that came with free delivery over the mothering weekend , free chocolates and a free personalized card .
negative	i got an_email_saying that they will be delivered on the saturday 00th .
negative	they still have not arrived !!!!!
negative	i have tried_phoning all morning and no answer and the live_chat is always offline !
negative	i felt so excited for my nana , as it was going to be a complete surprise for her , i now feel so let_down !!
negative	i feel annoyed at myself as i didnt think to look at the websites reviews before buying .
negative	i expect to hear back from iflorist and get a full_refund !
negative	!
negative	i will never be buying from them again and i will be spreading the word to everyone not to buy from iflorist !!
negative	!
negative	bought this part as it said in description that it would fit my dyson_hoover part came and didn_'_t fit would nt buy from here again .
negative	really disappointed as i was looking_forward to having my tyres_changed at home to save time and money before a long journey .
negative	booked a morning appointment so expected someone between 0 . 00am and 0 . 00pm .
negative	when no one arrived we called and were told they were running really late with no one available until at_least 0 . 00pm .
negative	we would not have minded if we had a phone_call to warn us or apologise or if we had been told we may have to wait all day , but there was no call , no apology and they did not care .
negative	book a local firm and save your time and money ... thank_you at_least for the refund , but not impressed .
negative	initially very pleased arrived next_day as promised .
negative	unfortunately didn_'_t last more than a week .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	if there were a " no star " option i would have chosen that .
negative	i ordered lactol kitten replacement milk on the 00 october and i '_m still_waiting for the order today november 00 .
negative	i got an_email on nov 0th to say the order had been dispatched .
negative	why did it take 0 day to dispatch ?
negative	00 day in the life of a small kitten is a very long time .
negative	i had to buy the powdered milk elsewhere .
negative	when i called to complain i was told i now have to give the delivery company 00 working_days to sort it out !!!
negative	ridiculous .
negative	so unless you have all the time in the world and the patiece of a saint .
negative	do not order frome this company !
negative	the new type of batteries are useless after the first time they ' re used .
negative	i '_ve tried all ways to get them charged and it never works .
negative	the refills have also gone down_hill .
negative	the last packet i bought had small holes in and just didnt work .
negative	unfortunately , i '_m going to have to find another_supplier which is a shame because they used to be so good .
negative	ordered a fireplace which was 0 - 00 days_later took a month had to keep phoning them as no correspondence finally arrived no mirror phoned again they were going to ring back still_waiting !
negative	spent fifty pound on a voucher , could not contact vendor to redeem .
negative	living_social refused to refund or credit account .
negative	definitely do not use this company , i certainly will not use again .
negative	terrible delivery service , please do not order from this company , i ordered 0 items of furniture from them and as i live in " the country " ( large town just outside glasgow ) they would only deliver to the pavement outside my property .
negative	the girl on the phone made it sound like i was ridiculous expecting the delivery company to deliver to my flat , i think its ridiculous that they expect me to pay £_00 delivery to have the items dumped on the pavement outside my flat !
negative	they are also threatening to charge delivery even_though they did not deliver .
negative	nice professional website but do not be_fooled by the prices .
negative	use another company , be warned .
negative	i have now waited almost 0_weeks on an_email_advising when i will receive my refund .
negative	i '_ve taken legal_advice and am patiently awaiting their response to my requests both on email and telephoned .
negative	i ordered flowers to be sent to my sister in law with full address and postal code - she_lives in a tiny hamlet with few houses .
negative	i received a message from you to say these had been delivered yesterday as requested - they have not been delivered !
negative	as this is a small_hamlet i am sure a neighbour would have brought them over to her .
negative	please_note - this is the second time this has happened .
negative	last_year for mothers_day my daughter sent me flowers which you swore were delivered , they were not , and you failed to refund her or deliver the flowers , despite_numerous contacts by my daughter .
negative	i want this resolved_immediately .
negative	sorry can , t leave a catchy_header as i am very dissappointed with your service ordered an express wash_basin on the 00th_feb and still not recieved it yet , it is now the 00th of march , even_though i was told if i had any_problems to ring the local_store which i have done they said they would look into it and phone me back this was last_week i am still_waiting .
negative	firstly the " returns service " via named shops - none of the shops the parcel was taken to knew anything about the returns services !
negative	one of the shops didn_'_t even exist .
negative	then went on to return part of my order via_royal_mail , which cloggs are denying having received .
negative	will never use this company again !
negative	i booked for some tyres to be replaced last_week .
negative	the ordering was painless and easy but the service i received was appalling !
negative	they just did not turn_up with no communication .
negative	i rang and they said the fitter had been over booked .
negative	i am self_employed , so i lost two and a half days pay for their mistake which they eventually admitted !
negative	they have now offered me the grand_total of £_00 . 00 refund .
negative	bad_experience will never use them again !
negative	i placed my order on 0 january .
negative	by late at night 00 january , i still had not received any contact as to when i might expect my order to be delivered .
negative	i hope to hear soon .
negative	delivered a day late and was fobbed_off by customer_services when i called
negative	i paid for express delivery on an order from amazon , and the seller has chosen to send the parcel with yodel .
negative	tracking shows it has_been at my local_depot , 0 mile from the delivery address , since 0th_feb .
negative	it then shows ' delivery not attempted ' for several days ( i . e .
negative	couldnt be bothered ), followed_by a ' weather delay ' ( weather here is fine ), then 0 x ' delivery attempted , could not gain_access '.
negative	delivery is to my work place , their first ' no access ' was due to attempting to deliver at 0pm ( not in business hours despite company name being clearly_indicated ), the second was 0 . 00pm and i know they didn_'_t try as i was covering the reception_desk at the front of the building all afternoon and no vehicles came into our car_park !
negative	!
negative	their ' live_chat ' has_been particularly unhelpful too , just saying ' sorry we '_ll get it there when we can '.
negative	no definite answers , no sincere_apology and no compensation / gesture of goodwill offered .
negative	shocking customer service .
negative	it is now 00th_feb , and still no sign of my ' express delivery '.
negative	i found the bed i wanted online , on sale , however i decided to go to my local_branch to order as i was hoping to see one on display ( which it wasn_'_t unfortunately ).
negative	i waited around for quite a while for a sales_assistant to take my order , i felt like they ignored me as being a girl in my early 00s , they probably didn_'_t expect me to buy anything or spend much .
negative	when i finally got assistance to order , i had to explain the item '_s specification to the assistant ( for example , she asked what colour i wanted , it only comes in one colour ).
negative	she quoted me a 0 - 0 week delivery time , despite their website stating within 0_weeks , but i agreed as i explained i had the 0th week off work already so that would be ideal .
negative	i was assured i would be contacted to discuss the delivery , which i paid £_00 for due to my order being in their higher value bracket .
negative	at the end of week 0 , i emailed fv to ask where my order was as it was late and i '_d had no contact from them at all .
negative	the manager rang me back promptly within the hour , and apologised saying he would contact the warehouse and find out , then call me the next_day .
negative	he didn_'_t .
negative	i left it 0_days then called to be told he was not working .
negative	the assistant told me she could get my delivery to me 0_days_later on thursday ( the end of week 0 ).
negative	i explained that this was not convenient , as i had discussed with the manager before .
negative	i was told to sort it myself with the delivery company when they called me , a call i am expecting this week .
negative	i am now expected to take unpaid time off work to accept their 0 - week late delivery , and i will also have to unassemble and move my old bed myself ( as i said , i am a girl in my 00s and i '_m not great at diy or lifting ).
negative	to top it all off , i had a call from my parents which is my previous address ( which they took for credit check purposes ) to say fv have left 0 incomplete voicemails on their phone - i don_'_t live there , i only have a mobile and i don_'_t know how they got the number or why they feel the need to ring it !
negative	!
negative	wish i had read these awful reviews on here before stepping into fv instead of just being sucked in by a great bed offer .
negative	fingers_crossed it gets delivered at some point , with all the parts , undamaged and assembled correctly .
negative	may be too much to ask .
negative	dårlig kundeservice når varen skal sendes retur og påstand om ikke modtaget varer retur .
negative	køber aldrig vare hos miinto ( fit0run ) igen .
negative	......
negative	............
negative	i '_m extremely upset about the mother '_s day bouquet that was delivered to my elderly_mother 0_days before mothers_day .. not on the day as i had requested ..... the bouquet was a disgrace ... looked like it had been thrown together .
negative	in less_than 00_hours many of the flowers had died although it had been kept in perfect conditions .... i emailed iflorist twice ... no answer ... i phoned them and was told that no calls were being taken and that i should email them again ... which i did ... no answer .. i tried to live_chat with them .. no answer .
negative	what do i do now .
negative	this is probably the worst service that i had ever received from any company .
negative	be warned unlimited data usage at home is not applied to europe .
negative	just received 000 . 00 in data roaming charges , as a gesture of good will vf said they would refund 00_%, which i was not happy with .
negative	i now read on watchdog and eu websites that there is a 00 euro monthly cap on data roaming charges .
negative	are vf contravening my human rights ?
negative	so i have made 0 complaints via phone and internet chat and now an_email .
negative	excitement wasn_'_t the word to describe us getting a new_kitchen and on going to wren show rooms we were more so .
negative	little did we know what a shambles this company really were !
negative	we were asked to pay a deposit of over_£ 0000 which we did and then to pay the full_amount once the order was being placed .
negative	this should have rung warning bells but we were still on a high .
negative	the salesman we dealt_with assured us and sounded very professional about what we had chosen and what we wanted at first !
negative	after that it all went down_hill drastically from there and the excitement we had in the beginning turned sour !
negative	the occurrence of wrong units and pieces of the kitchen being delivered became common dragging the fitting of the kitchen from 0 week to almost 0_months !!!!
negative	each time some incorrectly delivered we then had to wait two_weeks for the correct ones to come .
negative	our kitchen_fitters , who were brilliant as we had our own and not wrens , were very patient the whole time but not surprised at the hassle we were having as they had encountered it before .
negative	their extra time for coming_back to re - do the wrong doors / architrave / handles etc all cost us extra money .
negative	i have told everyone who has mentioned to me about going to wren_kitchens for their dream kitchen this story and not to bother unless they want a complete headache !!
negative	all the time we had problems not once did the ' salesman ' come to see what was wrong we had to go to him and chase for everything , as we are doing now for the extra_cost incurred by us for the fitters .
negative	no answer or communication has come from this salesman or anyone at wren_kitchens about the problems we have had .
negative	non professional is the word and money grabbing is another !
negative	the kitchen is finally finished but still no word re our money but then we didn_'_t think there would be .
negative	just stay clear of this fly by night company unless you want to be frustrated , upset and totally stressed !
negative	never again !
negative	i waited nearly an_hour , listening to the most annoying music , especially when the loop played the songs for a second and third time .
negative	when i finally spoke to someone the department i needed had had gone home !
negative	they said they would phone back .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	i waited , listening to the same looped music for 00_minutes to be told nothing had been logged from my previous call .
negative	they assured me someone would call back in three_days .
negative	that was six days ago !
negative	i '_m going to have to call them back , that '_s three hours of my life i '_ll never get back !
negative	received no confirmation by email so emailed and telephoned constantly all day saturday before we left uk to go on holiday as it claims customer_services is open 0 - 0 . 00 mon - sat with but received no replys .
negative	on the sunday we were due to fly and still no telephone_number to contact meet and greet service at stanstead so there was nobody to meet us and ended_up having to park in mid stay car_park and pay £_00 for 0_days parking and get a bus with 0 young_children and suitcases .
negative	they then told me that they would not refund me !!
negative	awful service .... will not recommend to anyone .... better to pay a few pound more and get a proper service and less stress !
negative	i ordered 0 items , signed for the delivery , but when opened the box only 0 item , nothing about other item , packing_slip - didnt get one .
negative	awaiting a reply fr om them :(
negative	i felt it was not explained to me that when i paid for the protection on my sofa that i was led t_believe my table and tv_unit were included , however when i got home i realised they had charged me an extra £_00 !!
negative	i was also not told i could pay nothing for a year , i also decided to change the colour a few_days_later after i had paid for the order . i phoned head_office and complained four times and no apologyor nothing was sorted untull i said i would cancel my booking !!
negative	i weill not be recommending you to anybody which is such a shame because the quality of your furniture is good .
negative	very dissappointed !
negative	!
negative	ordering was fine , however deferring my order was impossible despite giving 00_hours notice so my expensive gift was wasted and sits at an empty house for a week
negative	i '_ve shopped alot at argos for many_years , my mother used to say that i kept them in business .
negative	however , this has always been in the actual store .
negative	my sister has made her first order with their home delivery service , which is still ongoing as they keep delaying her delivery .
negative	she ordered two items with them , both listed as in stock .
negative	a week_later ( and three_days before the scheduled delivery ), they called and said they were having problems with the suppliers ( i . e .
negative	one , or both , of the items were not actually in stock ).
negative	she , unhappily , rescheduled the delivery for ten days_later .
negative	this time , they call on the morning of the delivery and say that the item ( s ) are still unavailable , and that it is a short_notice cancellation because it only just showed up on the systems .
negative	to say the least , seems like argos need to update their systems and reconsider their suppliers .
negative	this may seem like a minor_inconvenience to some , but my sister has just moved_into a new home and needs these items .
negative	one is a fridge_freezer , and due to argos ' utter incompetence , she is losing a significant_amount of money every day because she is having to waste food as she has nowhere to store it .
negative	so that '_s how argos is effecting her financially .
negative	the other is a set of bunk_beds for her two children , who have to remain sleeping on the floor until argos decide that they can finally fulfil their end of the deal .
negative	regardless of her personal situation , fact is fact .
negative	claiming that you have an item in stock and available for purchase is selling under misinformation .
negative	furthermore , agreeing to dates and being unable to meet these agreements abuses the contract to which the consumer agreed in purchasing these good .
negative	they have offered to refund the £ 0 . 00 delivery cost , which doesn_'_t come close to the amount that she has had to pay because of their incompetence , never mind the inconveniences and sufferings of her and her two children .
negative	she was actually warned by friends beforehand not to use this service as they had experience problems , but thought that based on our in - store experience , argos was a trustworthy company .
negative	i have since heard from other friends that they have had similar grievances .
negative	this service is appalling and will cause you inconvenience , take up your time , and , depending_on the particular situation , might actually cost you financially .
negative	don_'_t risk it .
negative	i wanted to give this company no stars , but it turns_out i can '_t submit this without giving it one .
negative	i have been a customer with o0 since march of this year .
negative	i took our a 00 month_contract with a blackberry_bold 0000 0_weeks_ago the phone stopped_working i took it back to my nearest_store sent it off for repairs and a week_later was contacted to say that the phone couldn_'_t be fixed and because it was under_warranty ( great i thought ) i was legible for a brand_new phone , i took away what i thought was a ' brand_new ' phone of the same model i had previous , to find out that it is infact a re - cycled phone where somebody at some point in time has had the phone previously to me so deffinately not ' brand_new '!
negative	now 0_weeks on my ' new phone ' has had to be sent off again for the exact_same problem only this time when i went into the store the sales_advisor told me it was a ' common fault ' on the specific model i had , clearly upset i asked was there anything i could do even suggested paying more to my existing contract to change the model phone ( which i shouldnt have to seeing as the model they sold me on a 00 month contact hasnt even lasted 00 and was malfunctioning as of its own accord and not my fault ) to which i was told to basically ring o0 customer_services and ' kick off '.
negative	after_spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
negative	i was basically told to like it or lump it there was nothing that they were willing to do to help me .
negative	i do not agree all the staff i spoke to that day were rude and didn_'_t care 0 women genuinely tried to help the situation but still after our conversation it was left unsolved .
negative	i have emailed o0 a complaint and it will be reviewed within 00 days but i don_'_t expect their reply will resolve the situation i '_m in .
negative	i do not value their customer_relations much after this experience .
negative	i ordered these flowers for a very sick_friend , they were meant to be delivered today , but never arrived .
negative	i even gave a contact phone number should there be a problem delivering them , so really there is no excuse .
negative	i '_ve always used teleflorist in the past with no problem , i will not be using them in the future .
negative	the bouquet was for my mums_00th & i purchased a large bouquet however it was not very large & there was more greenery than flowers for the amount i spent .
negative	i was very disappointed
negative	once more my parcel was delivered to the wrong_address if a delivery man dont_know difference_between flats and house it is hard to expect good service .
negative	once more i had to appologise to my neighbours who has got same door number as me as i felt quilty knocking to their doors and begging for a parcel .
negative	i will avoid post_office at any cost and i will pay extra for a different company
negative	disgusted with service - use this company at your_peril .
negative	i ordered a funeral bouquet to be delivered yesterday .
negative	order confirmed and money taken .
negative	i decided to call an_hour ago ( one day after expected delivery ) to confirm they had been delivered as i had no email or text to say they had .
negative	iflorist had a " transmission " issue on their end which_meant my order didn_'_t get passed to spain ( although they didn_'_t think to contact me to tell me this ).
negative	i was promised a call back before they closed at 0 . 00pm this evening to see if they could get something delivered today .
negative	the lady on the phone actually didn_'_t even offer this as an option - she offered me a refund which didn_'_t really help me get flowers delivered to a funeral !
negative	its now 00 . 00 and i '_m still_waiting for a call .
negative	have ordered from interflora and will be chasing a full_refund with compensation .
negative	lastminute . com have totally messed_up a 0 day trip to lisbon fior me and 0 of my friends .
negative	tried booking flights / hotel package online , saw a good deal , entered_details for 0 people , names , dates of birth etc etc , by the time i pressed confirm , the flights had gone .
negative	found alternatives , went down same process , same result .
negative	did this 0 times , with no luck .
negative	frustrated , i thought i '_d phone them .
negative	deal with a real_human .
negative	little did i know .
negative	again , gave the guy details of what i wanted , told him i had seen something at 000_quid each .
negative	hey , i can do something better he says .
negative	000_pounds .
negative	great says i .
negative	gave him all details again for 0 people , by the time he spelt out and repeated every detail i gave him , the flights had gone .
negative	he finally found something at over 000_quid , i told him i was not happy , as i had started at 000_quid , he offered 000_quid , now , after 00_minutes , i '_m at over 000_quid .
negative	he explained that the flight prices move up and down , ok , i understand that .
negative	but if lastminure . com employed a call_centre that had people speaking decent english , the transaction could have been conducted quicker , meaning i would have got my flights .
negative	spoke with supervisor , he said he would call me with something within half hour , its now been hour and 00_minutes and nothing , not even the courtesy of a call telling_me they cant help .
negative	thanks lastminute . com , you have messed_up our midweek break , and basically you couldnt care less .
negative	i will not be using you again , and i recommend that other people dont either .
negative	i redeemed my wowcher for venus and mach 0 razor_blades on the 00th_august , i have still not received my order .
negative	i have sent wowcher 0 emails now , as yet i have not received a response ( apart_from their automated email ) yesterday , i telephoned them only to be told that they can not give me any information right now as there process has changed and there procedure is to call back or send an_email with the information .
negative	so after 00_minutes of being on hold waiting to talk to a human they still could '_t tell me where my order is !!!!
negative	what is the point of having a telephone_number !
negative	!
negative	you can probably all guess_what i '_m going to say next , yes thats right i still have not heard back from wowcher !!!
negative	!
negative	i understand that orders can get delayed or lost in the postal_system , working for a mail order company myself in customer_services i deal with this type of query all the time .
negative	what i do not find acceptable is their standard of customer_care , still not to have received a reply 0_weeks_later in my eyes is not acceptable .
negative	i will now be contacting paypal and requesting a refund .
negative	i have ordered quite a few things from wowcher , and this level of service has left me dubious as to whether or not i should order again .
negative	i joined with npower in november , after nearly 0_months with them i am astounded how completely_incompetent they are !
negative	firstly , whenever i do phone there is usually a 00 minute ( or more ) wait for call to be answered and ten when they do pick_up they have accidentally cut me off ... twice !
negative	you can_imagine how happy i was with that after holding for 00_minutes .
negative	they have assured me i had been changed to correct single rate tariff as i used to need economy 0 but after ringing to confirm this i was told it actually hadn_'_t been done at all , despite telling them to 0 times .
negative	i have rung with meter_readings every_month and they have lost them and not stored any of them .
negative	they told me someone would be in touch about changing my meter , no one rang .
negative	they told me to input my meter serial_number so it could be linked to my account .... they still_haven_'_t linked it ...... i could go on , but i '_m boring myself !
negative	in a nutshell - stay away , you will spend many precious hours of your life on the phone to their complaints_department only to be ignored !
negative	dont buy these flowers you could buy better ones from a garage !!!
negative	!
negative	please_avoid this company at all costs !
negative	i did all my christmas shopping online this year and this remains the only item i have not yet received !
negative	it was also the first order that i placed - on 0 december and only after chasing my order did i receive an_email_saying that it was ' despatched ' on 00 december !
negative	still nothing !
negative	i have researched this company and can only add to the hundreds of claims that they are thieving fraudsters !
negative	i have contacted my bank and am looking to get my credit_card recharged - i will also be contacting the police and do my utmost to get this company rubbed through all_kinds of dirt .
negative	i have placed a couple of orders with beauty_bay the last one was supposed to be next_day delivery which i paid_extra for when it did not arrive i rang customer service was told sorry it was not despatched as dpd not collected i was told that i would be a refund back of the extra i paid - received nothing .
negative	then when the parcel arrived i asked the dpd driver why it had been delayed i received a shrug no apology - very poor service
negative	to get set_up to advertise ( among other things ) you have to put in the address of your property .
negative	it won_'_t accept mine , and correspondence to an anonymous person or computer come_back over and over that ' they have set_up the address ' - they don_'_t acknowledge that when i try to validate it the " next " or " continue " button is greyed out ( even_though i have sent screen prints ) so i can '_t set_up my ad .
negative	hence - no listing , and no bookings … and nearly 0_weeks worth or repetitive e_-_mails getting no where .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	and all this effort for me to give 00_% of my hard_earned income - if i ever get any !
negative	useless .
negative	( i will be forward a link of this review to them to make a point )
negative	we have purchased tickets with bravofly and were charged an adminstration fee in error .
negative	after chasing the company on numerous_occasions , they finally acknowledged that my card had been overcharged and that i was due a refund .
negative	i have now been told the refund may take up to 0_months to come through .
negative	in my view , this time frame is unreasonable .
negative	the customer service team have been very slow to respond to date and i will not use this company again .
negative	i ordered duvets , covers and pillows from this company via_amazon .
negative	the pillows were not in the parcel so i tried_ringing them .
negative	each time i phoned the answer machine cut in , i tried over and over again but no reply .
negative	i looked on their website and found an_email address , so i emailed them , still no reply .
negative	it was only after_contacting them via_amazon that they eventually sent an_email_saying they had sent the pillows with the other stuff - no they had not , and so they would have to investigate via their despatch department and carrier .
negative	what a load of rubbish that is , the cost of pillows is under_£ 0 .
negative	the goods were okay as you get what you pay for , but there is no customer service whatsoever and are the worst company i have ever come_across .
negative	it is not worth the hassle of dealing_with them .
negative	i booked a delivery at 0 . 00am on tuesday_morning , for collection by weds 0pm .
negative	my parcel was not collected .
negative	when i telephoned them i was told the driver had run_out of time .
negative	why offer this service if you cannot keep to it ?
negative	?
negative	i was told my parcel would be made a priority pick_up on thurs .
negative	it was collected at about 0pm on thurs , for next_day delivery on fri .
negative	i have been contacted by my very unhappy customer that he has not received his parcel today and when looking at the tracking , he will not get it until monday .
negative	just what do you consider to be a good service ?
negative	what do you class as next_day delivery ?
negative	it has taken nearly a week and my customer still doesn_'_t have his parcel .
negative	i will expect a full_refund , priority delivery and i will never use your service again , or recommend you .
negative	disgusting .
negative	me and my partner booked flight , hotel & car through dial - a - flight .
negative	we have successfully used them twice before and were not concerned_about anything going wrong .
negative	we arrived at our hotel to be told that our reservation had been cancelled 0_days prior by a company named tourico .
negative	basically dial a flight use another company to make the accommodation bookings .
negative	lowcostbeds . com who then use yet another company .
negative	im not sure of the details as they have not had the courtesy to give me an explanation . we had to pay for our 0st nights accommodation and for some reason were told we could not stay at the resort we had selected and paid for over 0_months prior .
negative	we ended_up in budget accommodation .
negative	0 month on i have had little response to my complaint and am struggling to obtain a refund for the price difference_between the 0 hotels , the money i had to spend buying the hotel room that first night let_alone any form of compensation for losing an entire day of my holiday .
negative	accidently let it run over an extra month .
negative	would not let_me have a refund for this mistake .
negative	some lovely daylight_robbery
negative	i was keeping an eye on the tracking of delivery .
negative	this parcel was very important ( an_alternative wedding dress from very ).
negative	i sat all morning staring_at my front_door with my dog sat at the window ready to shout to tell me the man was at the door .
negative	my dog didn_'_t bark and there wasn_'_t a knock .
negative	i checked the tracking at 00 . 00 supposedly they had tried to deliver and left a card .
negative	there was no card , no bark , no knock , and all this happened while i sat 00ft from the front_door .
negative	so i rang the depot and she rang the driver , who told her that he had run_out of cards but did knock .
negative	my dog was confused is this man invisible ?
negative	she then went on to say she checked the drivers tracker ( in his body ?
negative	i live in a lane he can '_t drive down .)
negative	and told me the driver had been to my village implying i '_m the one who is lying .
negative	my dog licked the frustrated tears from my face ( having real wedding dress problems ) and patted my knee .
negative	she told me the driver will be back by two .
negative	i '_m sat in the window myself now and waiting for the apperence of this driver .
negative	i will be ringing her back at two to ask her to check his tracker .
negative	if this is the type of service i can expect i will not be using them again which means i will avoid very . co . uk .
negative	feckers
negative	later that day .
negative	the driver turned_up at 0 . 00 and knocked this time , my dog barked and went mental to get a stroke from the visitor .
negative	alas i put him in the kitchen .
negative	i open the door to collect my parcel from the jobs worth and he stands and lies to my face .
negative	" oh i knocked but there wasn_'_t an answer and i didn_'_t have any cards left ".
negative	i smiled sarcastically while my dog flipped him off .
negative	the barking is answer enough for me .
negative	there needs to be a negative star system put in place .
negative	or better yet get watchdog involved or whoever it is that handles bad practice !
negative	on thursday 00th_december i placed and paid via telephone for 0ft folding pool_table which i was told i would receive on monday_00rd_december .
negative	on friday 00th_december i received and email about 0pm advising that my pool_table had been dispatched and confirming delivery date .
negative	on friday at 0 . 00pm i had a missed call and voicemail_message_informing_me that my pool_table had been damaged in transit and alternatives would be to find something_else on their website or a refund .
negative	on the morning of saturday 00st_december i contacted the company and explained my predicament to the call_handler - i told her the pool_table was for my 0 year_old little_boy '_s main present and i tried everything in power to source another one for christmas .
negative	she advised that there were no other pool_table available as they had sold out of them .
negative	i requested a refund and she said this would be done on monday_00rd_december .
negative	i contacted them on monday and the call_handler advised they were unaware i requested a refund and advised it would be processed that day .
negative	i checked with my bank on friday 00th , nothing and then again on monday 00th when i had to contact them again and was told that my refund had somehow not been processed but the money would be in my bank_account by that evening .
negative	this never happened and i am still_awaiting my refund .
negative	when i contact them on thursday 0nd_january , the manager refused to speak to me which i think is absolutely ridiculous .
negative	i have been patient with them and put up with lies every time i have had to contact them .
negative	its a joke especially after_reading their spiel on their website about their commitment to customer service before , during and after a sale .
negative	also their 0 day money back guarantee should be questioned .
negative	they have left me stressed and out of pocket this christmas !!!
negative	!
negative	interlink_express told me i would receive my package between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 i waited at home the whole day and nothing arrived .
negative	i sent two emails but received no reply .
negative	they claimed i was out and there was no one to sign for the package , however it said on the website my package hadn_'_t even of left the depot station .
negative	the next_day i receive a text saying my package will be here between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , i look online at 00 : 00 and it says my driver is an_hour away and the package still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	this company is a joke , i don_'_t expect to waiting at home all day in case they send it back to the depot station , also the customer service is non_existent .
negative	edit
negative	i am still_waiting for my package which was meant to arrive 0 hours ago , the gps tracker for the van said it was 00_minutes away around an_hour ago , now when i go to track the van the map has disappeared .
negative	i also can '_t ring anyone to see where my package is .
negative	this is a complete_joke and i will never use this service again / discourage anyone i know from using your awful company .
negative	bad i aint had my order yet x
negative	paid_extra money for express delivery but wasn_'_t delivered - said was no one to sign at 0pm despite it being a business that '_s open until_0pm will 0 people on site to sign .
negative	ended_up having to collect from depot so seriously out if pocket !
negative	ordered correct sized shoes and when arrived box stated size ordered .
negative	they would not fit and when i looked at bottom of shoe , wrong_size in box .
negative	could not get the phone number to ring line " this user not available ".
negative	eventually spoke to customer_services who informed me they were very sorry , would email warehouse .
negative	i had to request and state that i did not want to pay return postage ( you normally pay for returns ) and reluctantly i got a ticket emailed to me , also a 00_%_off next order .
negative	they do not sent out new shoes unless you pay again and reorder and refund takes up to 00 days .
negative	i am unhappy about being out of pocket x 0 .
negative	emailed labels are very hard to understand and you have to organise collection on net ( took me half a hour as tracking_number written differently on site ).
negative	too much effort and hassle for 0 pair of poorer_quality shoes ( my last pair is 0 years old and new ones which arrived of much_cheaper make ).
negative	wonder_if the company still the , original one ?
negative	i spent £ 0000 on bathroom items and when the toilet arrived it was not the measurements as on the website , tried to return it and the process is very awkward , also when they received it back via a national carrier that i paid for they will not accept it because it the box was wet !
negative	and they say 0 day over the returns day i : e on the 0th day not the 0th !.
negative	presently i am demanding my money back or will instigate a court summons .
negative	i will never trade with this company again , appalling customer service .
negative	had booked to catch 00 . 00 overnight bus from budapest to berlin on 0 / 0 /_0000 .
negative	the bus never came !
negative	i arrived early so definitely did not miss it .
negative	spent all night on the street waiting and eventually at 0am a different orangeways bus came and we demanded he call .
negative	we were told we could all fit on the 0am service ( same route ).
negative	interestingly this service said fullly booked on their website when it was less_than half full .
negative	i wondered_if they didnt bother sending the 00 . 00 bus so they could combine two services .
negative	no one answers the orangeways number and have had no response to my emails .
negative	avoid the hassle and don_'_t use !
negative	disgusting service and the ' included hot refreshments ' were non - existent .
negative	booking_reference_0000000
negative	i was very unhappy with my booking as it cost me an extra £_00 as apparently i had booked a crossing from calais to dover when i wanted a crossing from dover to calais .
negative	i don_'_t know what happened .
negative	when i printed_off my booking it did it is landscape so i only had the top bit of my booking confirmation .
negative	if it had the whole booking i would have spotted the mistake .
negative	i know i had trouble paying as you wanted me to use paypal .
negative	i don_'_t know whether in clicking around so that i could pay with my debit_card i inadvertently changed the booking .
negative	yes when i looked now at my booking confirmation whole on the screen i see the mistake but it was an honest mistake and to be charged an extra £_00 seems very unreasonable .
negative	i did book in a hurry because my husband was ill and i was not sure_whether i was going to be able to go .
negative	however i had been checking prices over the previous few_days so i do not understand how the booking slipped from the dover / calais booking .
negative	i will be coming_back to the uk at the beginning of september .
negative	to date i have always booked with p and o and never had this mistake before .
negative	i have only just had the internet connected so have not been able to contact you before .
negative	when you transfer_funds from a bank_account to paypal it says it takes 0 - 0_days but always takes seven and sometimes longer .
negative	its pure greed that it takes this long because they suck up as much interest with your money as they can .
negative	will avoid paypal an even co '_s associated with them from now on .
negative	moved to talktalk because of very high charges only to find talktalk are just as expensive but the service they provide is appalling .
negative	internet is sooo slow , it just stops working many_times during the day and at night cant even watch a 0 min video without constant buffering .
negative	also talktalk put a cap on charges and once you go over the limit they simply cut you off ... every time !
negative	just waiting for the contract to end so i can get_rid .
negative	had cheek to charge me for broadband and then forgot to set it up !!!!
negative	then charged me for leaving them - avoid at all costs , call_centres abroad and cant understand a word you say then get passed from one person to another and problem still not sorted
negative	i sent my phone having been recommended by a family_member it was iphone_0s valued at £_000 i then received a email_telling_me that my phone was a 0 and only worth £_000 i phoned them up they had a different emi number than the phone i sent but they couldn_'_t send my phone back as it had already been processed they then sent me the original amount .
negative	so no i would not recommend them to anyone as i don_'_t trust them
negative	the light do not recharge enough to stay lit_up over dark not very happy with them
negative	absolutely the worst ever service , from customer service to no service , several complaints resolved in aparently no line faults , then an engineer came round and confirmed there were several , up to 00 times in one min ... after trying to make them understand , that they had charged me more than i signed_up for after two months of incorrect bills , and many calls from the mobile , for which they had the number , said i was not entitled to compensation for the costs .
negative	they would not let_me lodge a complaint after 00_mins on the phone , and said they would call me every day until i agreed to close it , well i won_'_t .
negative	only offered me what they had overcharged in the first place .
negative	they wanted 00 . 00 for me to end the contract that they are not supplying , well i will take it to the ombudsman first . oh and as if by magic the line came back for 0 mins , and low and behold their systems are always down so you can '_t be transferred to someone with a brain and have to keep pressing 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 and repeating all your details over and over , so frustrating and angry .
negative	don_'_t go with this lot .....
negative	we booked the harry_potter tour in london , our plane got in a little late so we called the tour office told them this and that we were taking a taxi there .
negative	we we ' re informed they would let the bus know and that it left at 0pm .
negative	we arrived 0 minutes till 0 only to discover the bus already gone .
negative	we trying to inquire inside we were treated rudely by completely non helpful people who basically told us they wanted us to go away .
negative	our tour director from go_ahead tours whom we were in london tried_calling them to see if we could reschedule our tour , to be treated just a rudely again .
negative	we had to go on our own and pay for everything all over again .
negative	london is a very friendly city to tourist unless you make the mistake of booking with golden_tours .
negative	despatched item several days after they sent despatch confirmation_email
negative	has to open a paypal case to get refund
negative	stoll waiting
negative	terrible delivery time with no emails to suggest when it will arrive , i '_ve had to call and been told they have to wait for product to arrive with them before they ship to me but still not given a date .
negative	won_'_t use power direct ever again .
negative	would like someone to contact me urgently as i have never received my delivery yet the money was taken over a week_ago and have had no correspondance as to a delay !!!
negative	!
negative	so damn angry with this company .
negative	it '_s been now 0 whole days that we '_ve been stupidly waiting for our delivery !!
negative	called the depot on monday to be told that the goods were out for delivery : no delivery in the end !
negative	called on tuesday to be told that the delivery would happen between 0pm and 0pm : no delivery !
negative	called this morning to be told ' we can only apologise but we can_assure you that the delivery will happen this afternoon '.
negative	then received a text_message and an e_- mail from xdp today too to say that the eta for the delivery was between 0 . 00pm and 0 . 00pm : delivery or no delivery ?
negative	no delivery !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	what is the problem with this company ?
negative	never ever_experienced anything that appalling !
negative	now i take it i have to wait for a ' carded ' note on their website if the other customers ' bad_reviews are anything to go by ??
negative	?
negative	appallingly shocking !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	never wish to deal with them again and will for sure disregard any company which uses them as their courier !
negative	consignment_number is zwassr000000 if anybody with a tiny_bit of remnant professionalism wishes to look into this whole mess !
negative	far from impressed !!!!!
negative	!
negative	my order was cancelled without informing_me , so i never received the goods .
negative	what else can be said about that ?
negative	i dont_think i will be ordering again .
negative	all i received was a cancellation notice from paypal , so until i emailed pharmacy 0 u ,
negative	i had no idea what was going on .
negative	i booked and paid £_00 . 00 online with parcel_monkey to get a parcel sent to coventry next_day on 0 / 0th_feb_0000 .
negative	it was collected by city_link no problem but i was amazed to find parcel arrived back to me 00 days_later - no explanation , card or phone_call apologising or even giving me a reason .
negative	tried_calling parcel_monkey but no telephone_numbers avail .
negative	contact has to made via their online support which is slow and unresponsive ..
negative	i gave a detailed email explaining the problem but it has taken 00_hours for someone called ' may ' to ask if they can be of any help to contact them !
negative	for crying out loud , all i want is for my parcel to be collected and to be delivered to its_destination .
negative	unhappy customer .
negative	i bought a sacro - illiac support via physioroom '_s website , but sent it back due to poor fit .
negative	( someone had crossed out the manufacturers printed size and handwritten another ) i called their call_centre to advise i was sending the item back and was referred to the website for their company returns information .
negative	i did exactly as i should have done including writing a covering_letter explaining why i was returning the item with my order number and i expected my refund within 0_days as per their own t & c .
negative	0_days passed and nothing arrived .
negative	so , i called the customer_services line and got a young_man who was extremely unhelpful .
negative	he told me he couldn_'_t do anything about it as they were " allowed 0_days " to process it and the day of receipt didn_'_t count .
negative	he gave_me the impression that they wouldn_'_t entertain it until the five days had passed .
negative	he refused to take any details , refused to chase it up for me , in fact he couldn_'_t wait to get me off the line quick enough .
negative	i waited another four days and called again , got [_name_] ( customer_services ) told me it would be " 0 working_days to process any refunds "
negative	" yes dear , i know " i said , " i '_ve called you before and it '_s already been over a week since you signed for my parcel which is a bit over your 0 day rule , so where is my refund ?"
negative	well , it seems that the first young_man was not only rude but incompetent as he should have taken my tracking_number from [_link_] ( thank god i sent it tracked !)
negative	which i told him i had but he did nothing with it , and he should have sent an e_- mail to another department who have to trawl_through these countless pallets of incoming mail , look out my item and then the refund gets processed but it still takes another 0_days after that to reach me !
negative	it would seem that unless you don_'_t hound them , you wont get your money back !
negative	i mean what company in this day and age waits till the customer calls with a tracking_number before they start to process a refund ?
negative	do they not ever open their mail then ???
negative	?
negative	too many excuses , too many people who cant do the job they are paid for and the customer loses out .
negative	i am naturally very unhappy , and told this to [_name_] but i was brusquely dismissed " it '_s not our fault , its the banks , we have no control ... blah_blah_blah "
negative	ermm ..
negative	sorry physioroom , but i don_'_t think the bank has kept hold of my item in their warehouse sitting on a pallet somewhere for days on end without opening my parcel , never mind reading my letter or bothering to ask for the refund on my behalf .
negative	if the bank doesn_'_t know the customer is due a refund , the customer wont get a refund !
negative	hence a most unhappy customer .
negative	useless customer service , don_'_t care attitude - we '_ve got your money now so tough !
negative	i have bought goods online for years without_any problem whatsoever , with physioroom , it '_s all ok until something_goes_wrong then you can '_t get them to refund your money !
negative	ridiculous !
negative	never again .
negative	if i could i '_d give them nil stars !
negative	just rubbish service .
negative	p . s bet my review doesn_'_t appear on their website , feel ripped_off !
negative	how lucrative it must be to own a huge company where a considerable_amount of what you offer for sale you do not stock . then unsuspecting twerps like me , who do not read the reviews , order such items , in my case with a value of over_£_000 , and guess_what , the company is unable to supply the item . oh_yes they will inform you quickly enough , and offer something_else , or a refund , but not before they have grabbed your money . the name of the game is then to hang on to it for as long as possible , in my case a month despite_being told that the money would be refunded to my pay_pal account on two occasions . needless to say i am still_waiting , and will have the hassle of entering into a dispute . companies like this will sail very close to the wind unless the law moves to plug these glaring sharp practices . i think the black_hole contains too many of their victims , and hope that you the reader will beware . glenda kirby . devon
negative	i bought a brand_new fridge_freezer in december , the fridge_freezer had an odd smell when it arrived but this was just put down to be being new .
negative	after a couple of months the smell was getting worse and the fridge started making very loud noises , so phoned through to currys .
negative	the first engineer was sent out , acknowledged the smell , but could not find where it was coming from .
negative	since this point hotpoint have sent out a further 0 engineers , all whom found similar things .
negative	at this point the office of fair_trading got involved , and a letter was sent recorded delivery to currys , this was signed for at the address but not response was ever received .
negative	an_independent engineer found that the fridge is faulty and needs completely replacing .
negative	currys have now received the fridge but feel it appropriate that after 0_months + of issues , that it will take at_least a further week to upload the report which was sent from one of there stores .
negative	so after around 0_months , numerous phone_calls ( all made from us to them ) i am still left with a fridge_freezer that doesn_'_t work !
negative	:(
negative	i would never shop at , or recommend currys to friends or family or even my worst_enemy it has_been absolutely terrible !
negative	the product was exactly_what we wanted , only the next_day delivery did not happen , ordered on a friday , got it on tuesday , ripped_off
negative	too too greedy .
negative	i '_m not buying anymore lottery tickets ( although toying with the irish one which , at the moment , is fairer to the player .)
negative	i have always suspected jiggerypookery in our lottery since they refused to let richard branson take over and give more to players and charity ... i hope i live long enough to see the sh ** hit the fan and those who are ripping_off the money brought to book
negative	after waiting 0_weeks , with several assurances of stock becoming available , i ended_up cancelling my order for a neff gas_hob with powerdirect .
negative	i ordered the same product from another company on the wednesday and it was delivered on the saturday which is the service i expect .
negative	if they could get_hold of one , why couldn_'_t powerdirect ?
negative	0 . 0_weeks_later i '_m still_waiting for my refund !!
negative	very unhappy with this company .
negative	i ordered a bouquet as a thank_you gesture to a friend .
negative	upon_receipt of order & notification of despatch , i ordered a further bouquet for my mother in law .
negative	late on in evening i received a generic email & text to inform_me the flowers were on way .
negative	just by_chance i looked into the tracking .
negative	i was so upset to read the flowers had been messed_up .
negative	they had sent wrong bouquet & wrong message to recipients .
negative	i tried in vien to resolve this but the email only customer service were useless .
negative	no matter_how i tried , even posting them my receipt and acknowledgement , they just reply chapter & verse a generic_reply of no use nor ownership of the mess up .
negative	the whole_experience & flowers received were a total disgrace .
negative	if you are considering purchasing flowers , please choose wisely .
negative	serenata promise a full 000_% guarantee / refund of not satisfied .
negative	this is not the case nor are they interested in their customer_satisfaction .
negative	there are lots of reputable florists on line ; serenata are not in the running & they should be ashamed of their service !!
negative	!
negative	sent my sons sony_ericsson after been quoted £_000 . 00 .
negative	however , after many emails they quote the phone was never received .
negative	having recorded the delivery and questioned them about having actually signed for package , they now claim they had received the package but the packet was empty ( no handset ).
negative	we have managed to use the tracking device which was still in use on handset and shall be sending our proof of this been a fraudulent company to trading_standards as they still deny handling / received handset which evidently is not the case .
negative	i '_m surprised they believe they can actually continue trading with such unethical and underhand deception to unsuspecting and goodwill on customers behalf '_s .
negative	watch this space , better still watch watchdog or similar as that is the reality for these crooks ....
negative	.
negative	currently trying to resolve matter with post_office resolutions , not a good service nor an expected outcome .
negative	i do not recommend mobilephonexchange , nor do i approve them having trading
negative	placed my order on the 00th_november , paid_extra for saturday delivery .
negative	received an_email at 00 . 00_hours the night before advising that my order delivery date had been changed .
negative	contacted them by phone on the saturday_morning to complain and was asked when would i like the order to be delivered again .
negative	said the following saturday but i was not willing to pay another extra_charge for a saturday delivery and i wanted a refund of the extra_charge that i had already paid .
negative	they took the full_amount out of my account so had to contacted them again to request the refund again , finally got it .
negative	the following friday received another email at 00 . 00pm advising that my order would not be delivered yet again .
negative	when i contacted them again they could not tell me why my order was not delivered as it was sitting in the deport waiting to go .
negative	i said that i wanted this before wednesday the following week and they said that would be arranged .
negative	advised i wanted it delivered in the afternoon .
negative	got an_email today to advise that my order had been despatched and would be delivered tomorrow between 0 . 00am and 0 . 00pm , so much for requesting an afternoon delivery .
negative	will wait and see if it actually gets delivered this time .
negative	i called a week_ago to ask where my loyalty cheque was ( after waiting 00 days ) response was its on the desk waitingto be posted - may be another week - on complaining was informed youre lucky to get a cheque not all companies offer a dual_fuel discount !!!!!!!
negative	sorry but thatwas the reason i chose this company , cheque still notarrived after 00 days called again at my expense - no one in accounts and there has_been a problem with some cheques - you may have to wait another 00 days !!!!!!!
negative	this is unnaceptanle disgraceful management and i feel that you no_longer deserve my custom - i made a commitment toyou topay in full - on time for dual_fuel - wheres your commitment to me ?????
negative	not good enough
negative	just read due to unprecedented demand response to emails could take 0_days ah ah ah unprecedented complaints more like
negative	update no promised call_backs and not surprisingly still no cheques !!!
negative	!
negative	wish_id looked on here before i signed_up - avoid at all cvost
negative	disgrace .
negative	sent me an_email_advising that the costume had been dispatched by royal_mail .
negative	then i received another email_saying that they didn_'_t have the costume in stock and would not be able to deliver until after christmas .
negative	this was such a let_down as it has left no time to order or find a replacement for my daughters christmas .
negative	very disappointed and will not use again .
negative	well , been using these for a while - birthdays_etc and i '_ve been a good customer .
negative	for my aunties_00th they delivered it 0_days early and this left me a little deflated .
negative	i contacted them and got a ' what do you want us to do about it type reply that i found rude and aloof .
negative	they would not accept that their systems could be to blame .
negative	other_companies do an equally good job .
negative	i sent my mobile all intact then was told it arrived with one button missing .
negative	i don_'_t think so !!!
negative	so i got half the value .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again that '_s for sure
negative	cash_back from [_external_reference_] tracked at £_00 instead of £_000 .
negative	when i tried to claim for the additional amount i was unable to as more than 000 days had passed since the purchase date .
negative	never had this problem with quidco so won_'_t be using top_cash_back again .
negative	they make money from me phoning them as they insist on using a chargeable number , unles you subscribe to the sky phone service , then they keep you waiting for 00_mins before someone tells you to ring a different number or makes you reboot the box which ive already done .
negative	there is no e_mail address for this company which is ridiculous given that they supply internet services and expect me to use the online service to order from them !!
negative	!
negative	my partner and i never give out our numbers ( only friends and family ) we never fill in forms and leave our number on there .
negative	but over the last four months we have been inundated with sales calls and sales texts .
negative	we purposely don_'_t give out our numbers so we dont receive these nusense calls and texts so have you ( o0 ) sold our personal details ?!?!?
negative	i think so .
negative	we will be looking for another phone company that doesnt abuse the trust of its customers !
negative	like other people i sent my phone off to envirofone .
negative	cost me £ 0 . 00 because the post_office said the phone is only insured for £_00 and not £_00 as told by envirofone .
negative	couldn_'_t take the risk .
negative	sent off my perfect_condition i phone 0s and surprise_surprise it has triggered water_damage ?????
negative	original offer £_000 and new offer £_00 .
negative	i accepted the offer before reading into this just to avoid the inconvenience .
negative	i think people need to contact trading_standards for them to check that the public are not being lied too for them to make more money .
negative	my phone has never been near water ever .
negative	payment will not arrive until the 0nd may either .
negative	what a joke .
negative	i will contact trading_standards tomorrow and get this looked into as i think this needs to be checked out .
negative	i '_d bought cheap glasses from this site before and they were fine .
negative	they weren_'_t overly great but for £_00 i didn_'_t mind .
negative	i then decided to go for some designer_glasses when they sent me an_email offering 00_%_off glasses over_£_00 .
negative	i ordered a pair of ray - ban glasses with my prescription in them .
negative	the total was £_00 .
negative	i had rushed around getting my eyes_tested so as they were up to date for this more_expensive purchase so i was keen for my order to arrive .
negative	a few_days after the order i receive an_email_telling_me that my frames are discontinued in the size 00mm but they can change the order to 00mm .
negative	i replied and agreed to this .
negative	then a few_days passed and i received another email , they are also discontinued ... but are available in brown .
negative	i agreed to the brown .
negative	they emailed me again and said the brown was discontinued but if i '_d like to choose a completely new £_00 model they would give me a cheap pair of glasses free on top of that .
negative	by this time it has_been a week of back and forth emails and i had wanted only that style in ray - ban so i replied and asked for a refund .
negative	days_later and no reply from selectspecs .
negative	i was worried , they had £_00 of my money .
negative	i phoned them and talked to a woman_who had no time or compassion for my predicament .
negative	she said she '_d put the refund through and said " yeah they '_ll probably give you a 00_%_discount thats usually what they do .
negative	ok bye now ".
negative	i thought that was pretty lame but i couldn_'_t really say anything because she gave a very forceful air of " i don_'_t care ".
negative	i then received an_email_saying i '_d been refunded and sure here '_s a nice 00_%_discount_code ... even_though you originally had a 00_% one before all this happened .
negative	so stupid .
negative	unreal .
negative	they are a terrible site and i will never use them again .
negative	i ended_up going to [_external_reference_] and got 0 pairs of converse glasses for £_00 .
negative	much_better .
negative	better quality lenses too .
negative	i ordered some lenses online , due to a fault with their website i was charged_twice ( despite ringing them and being reassured this wouldn_'_t happen ) nearly two_weeks and numerous phone_calls later the refund has still not reached my account .
negative	i have now gone overdrawn with my bank and will incur charges .
negative	thanks a lot - i will not be using this company again .
negative	my sister has had a recent_bereavement and i wanted to send her some flowers as a little surprise to help cheer_her up .
negative	at 00 . 00 i had to ring and ask her if she '_d received anything because i felt sure she would have rung if they had .
negative	the surprise now spoilt , she then had to go out and hunt_around the house to see if she could find them .
negative	there was no card through the door and so it was obvious no one had attempted a delivery .
negative	i wrote to customer_services who said they would contact the couriers but it would be 00 to 00hrs before they could let_me know !!
negative	!
negative	at 0 . 00hrs this morning , my sister found the flowers dumped on the doorstep .
negative	no card or explanation and no idea how long they had been there .
negative	the whole_experience was upsetting and embarrassing and as far as the company was concerned ( as i '_ve no reply ) the flowers are delivered , end of story .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use this company again and the company certainly need to review the couriers they currently use .
negative	all the bad_reviews on twitter are mainly regarding delivery , so that should tell them something ..... hopefully !!
negative	!
negative	this company is an_absolute_joke !
negative	i bought my house in october_0000 and first_utility was already the supplier .
negative	i contacted them to change my details , they promised me a smart_meter and to set it up as direct_debit and it was done ... simple well so i thought !
negative	this company has_been a total_nightmare , no direct_debit was ever set_up , i have had to contact them every_month with at_least a 00 minute hold time .
negative	to top it off they have charged me £ 0 per_month because i wouldnt set_up as direct_debit .
negative	i have received at_least two red letters per_month demanding payment and one occassion i sent three e_-_mails , left one voicemail and was on hold twice for around half an_hour , i just could not get through to pay them .
negative	after 0 stressful months i have tried to close the account to find that they have well over charged me and getting a refund is beyond a joke .
negative	do not use this company !!!
negative	it may have cheaper prices but you will pay through phone bills and stress !
negative	!
negative	very annoying website as had x 0 groupon_vouchers for hay_fever tablets very small boxes and was not allowed to combine postage so ended_up paying 0 x postage and it all arrived in the same package so left very ripped_off will not use again !
negative	what a disaster !
negative	my boyfriend and i were left_stranded in the middle of london with a very important function to attend .
negative	easytobook . com just sent us from one non_existent booking to another .
negative	we ended_up staying in a b_& b that we found ourselves and missed the funcition .
negative	take my advice , use anyone_else !
negative	!
negative	i bought and recieved my groupon_voucher for a vax on april 00th and my code will still not work .
negative	groupon have reset the code and it isnt working and no - one from this company is getting back to me .
negative	it says to complete the online contact us form but no - one has contacted me .
negative	i have again submitted my details but this has_been dragging on for a month now .
negative	very poor service from both groupon and discountemporium . co . uk
negative	my daughter sent her i phone 0 after being given a valuation of £_000 .
negative	we had not heard from them after a week so logged on to tracker to see that they had reduced the offer to £_00 due to lcd_screen split / phone not working .
negative	when i rang i was told email must have gone to junk_mail and if you dont reply in five days they just send revised_offer .
negative	i had contacted them the same day the payment was processed and yet my phone had already " gone " and could not be returned to me .
negative	i was told phone wasnt working when it got to them .
negative	i said i would get bill from t mobile showing phone_calls made day phone was sent .
negative	they wouldnt let_me speak to a manager , wouldnt give full names as their " not allowed ".
negative	miracuously a supervisor appeared but was no help .
negative	i am contacting bbc_watchdog and daily mail for help
negative	i think it '_s easiest to explain_why i have awarded seven_seas one star by pasting my complaint letter here .
negative	i never received a reply from them .
negative	" it is now the 00th_september , 00 days after my box was collected by you to be shipped from china to the uk , and i have still not received it nor heard_anything from you about its progress .
negative	i am very disappointed with the service you have provided throughout this entire shipping process .
negative	using seven_seas has certainly not been a simple task .
negative	firstly , i did not receive any message_telling_me what time the driver would deliver the empty boxes to me and after several phone_calls it appeared the driver had got my address wrong .
negative	secondly , once my box had been collected on the 0th_july i heard_nothing from you to say how much i should pay you , and it was not until i had emailed you twice that i finally got my invoice emailed to me .
negative	it was dated the 0th_july , however , i did not receive it until the 00th_july , almost two_weeks after the collection date , causing my payment to be delayed .
negative	i subsequently emailed you to say that i was expecting my box to arrive in the uk within 00 days from the 0th_july , otherwise this would cause a huge inconvenience to me .
negative	you then assured me that my box was to arrive in the uk on the 00th of august and i was then to allow up to two_weeks for customs .
negative	two_weeks has already_passed now and i still have no idea where my box is .
negative	i consider the service you have provided to be very poor and completely_unacceptable .
negative	i am expecting compensation from you due to the reasons i have highlighted above .
negative	i will certainly not be using your company again in the future ."
negative	terrible service , the surveyor did not show up 0 times without prior notice .
negative	when calling customers service we did not even receive an_apology .
negative	in addition , we were told the fitting of our wardrobes would take place around 0 - 0_weeks after the designer had come out and contracts were signed but it is currently 0_weeks since this happened and we have an installation date in a further 0_weeks time - assuming that they will show up of course !
negative	i would not recommend this company to anybody and would strongly_recommend that you shop around and find a more trustworthy supplier who actually has a customer service department should anything go_wrong .
negative	we have since had our wardrobes fitted and are very unhappy with them .
negative	we asked for them to be the same as the last fitting just 0_months earlier yet this did not happen .
negative	i '_m not sure how such a description could be misinterpretated when the existing wardrobes are there to see .
negative	after trying to discuss this with hammonds numerous_times we could not get a call back !
negative	eventually we managed to speak to someone to day before we were threatened with court_action for the 00_% final payment and was told in no uncertain_terms that this is our fault and the issue will not be rectified .
negative	the caller then hung_up the phone on me and it was abundantly clear that they could not care less as the contract was signed and we had no option but to make the final payment .
negative	the wardrobes give no extra space than standard wardrobes purchased in a store would provide - it completely defeats the object .
negative	i '_m so disappointed and have found the entire_process very stressful .
negative	being pregnant , i certainly did not need such hassle .
negative	i think that hammonds are an appalling company , providing poor quality , not as_described wardrobes , and abysmal customer service .
negative	hammonds please do not comment on this asking me to contact you as firstly you have my account details on this review so you could havr easily contacted me if you want to , secondly , you have no_intention of putting my wardrobes right and i am not stuck with them .
negative	if you do change your stance and would like to correct your work i would welcome a call !
negative	i sent an_email enquiring if qs_supplies had a briston tap in stock .
negative	online said they had and it was available within 0_days .
negative	after 0_days and no reply to my email i telephoned their number .
negative	i got a gentleman_who put me on hold and said he '_d go and check .
negative	after several minutes , the music stopped at the other end of the phone but nobody spoke .
negative	i telephoned them again , got the same man and asked again if he had the item in stock , at which he promptly put down the phone on me !!
negative	!
negative	to say i was surprised was an_understatement .
negative	needless to say i will not be purchasing from this company even if the item i '_m desperate for is in stock with them .
negative	didn_'_t receive my item .
negative	unhappy
negative	i have used iflorist many_times to send flowers to the uk and france from where i live in australia because it is my only way of sending presents to people .
negative	the flowers have always arrived on time and made the recipient very happy .
negative	but this last time in december i ordered flowers for christmas_present for my mum and they never arrived .
negative	i contacted the so called live_chat to try and find out what happened and was given a tracking_link that made no sense as it was a lot of destinations in holland and france with a final_destination being 00km from my mums home .
negative	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
negative	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
negative	the live_chat kept cutting me off telling they had been been received even_though i told them twice they hadn_'_t .
negative	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
negative	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
negative	i was then told there was nothing they could do and was given a customer service number to ring .
negative	again , i rang and spoke to someone and explained the same thing again !
negative	this person was polite unlike everyone else who i had dealt_with , they took my number and said they would ring back and find out what had happened and they never called me .
negative	when he took my number i explained that it was an australian mobile and he needs to use the code and he said " yeh , yeh , yeh , i know what to do " which made me think immediately that he had no_intention of ringing me back !
negative	so after_contacting iflorist 0 times i have still not received a refund or redelivery .
negative	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0_weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
negative	so after all the lies that i have been given about the flowers being signed for by someone at my mums house , they arrive dead !
negative	if iflorist advertise to send international flowers they should be able to find out when there is a problem with delivery .
negative	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere ... then delivered after christmas .
negative	i would like my £_00 . 00 back please iflorist , your customer service is appalling and unfair .
negative	it is very difficult to contact people from australia so would have appreciated a bigger effort .
negative	or just a refund when i told you they never arrived .
negative	placed my order a week_ago & have not yet recived it .
negative	i wish i had used another company now as my dogs are out of treats for two_days .
negative	next time i will return to a company who i can be sure of .
negative	where do i start , constant issues .
negative	we had no gas supply to the house , i asked flo - gas to address the situation .
negative	they said that the regulator was now our property and we would be charged for a call out fee and a new regulator if that was the issue .
negative	as we were paying a fee on the tank i wanted the tank and gauge looked at first before we get charged for something that it may not have been - wouldn_'_t do it as they thought it would prob be the regulator = quids in for them .
negative	we waited 0_months with no gas as we refused to pay over_£_000 .
negative	it was cheaper for us to change suppliers !!!!!
negative	we followed the correct procedures and gave a months notices as per terms and conditions .
negative	now we get constant phone_calls and harassment letters for a £_000 uplift fee of the tank even_though we have had several conversations to say that it is free as the new gas supplier supplied own tank as per instructions on the terms and conditions on the back of flo - gas letters .
negative	still 0_months on we are getting constant reminder letters and calls to say we owe money , mental !!!!!
negative	they have already said 0 times that it was ok and that they will speak to finance to change it .
negative	today again another letter , my husband phoned back and they tried changing the terms and conditions , they said that the terms and conditions have changed since we signed the contract .
negative	basically they are making up new rules as they go along to get money out of customers .
negative	not happy !!!
negative	now i have to call back again to speak to a lady called jenny - customer_services manager - sort yourselves out
negative	purchased £ 0000 worth of furniture last_year .
negative	poor delivery service ,
negative	promised a mirror which never arrived even after several phone_calls to customer_services .
negative	sideboard was damaged , engineer made an attempt to fix and company offered £_00 discount which again we never received .
negative	can not recommend this company due to poor customer service .
negative	update
negative	after_reading this review the company has_been in touch and all issues has_been resolved but that took over 0_months
negative	tried to purchase something - was redirected to amazon .
negative	really dodgy !!
negative	does anyone know - do they sell your data on ?
negative	am i at risk of fraud as i gave them details - name , number , address , email , password ??
negative	i have cleared my cookies etc .
negative	i didn_'_t give them any payment details ?
negative	i ordered an ipod from cash converter almost 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i rang to chase_up this afternoon to be told it had been sold in the shop and the shop was closing_down .
negative	no communication at all , if i hadn_'_t chased my purchase i would have lost out on goods and a refund .
negative	0_star just for the fact got my money back .
negative	ordered what looked to be a decent size arrangement for mother '_s day , upgraded to medium_size for extra £ 0 , arrived in time but arrangement was tiny and pathetic for the cost .
negative	i was quite honestly embarrassed in front of my mum , vase was too_big so flowers just fell about .
negative	will not use again .
negative	lens not arrived and no communication to advise of tracking
negative	i ordered and paid for these flowers as a gift for mothers_day but i never recieved them .
negative	the money was taken from my account but no flowers top give to my mum .
negative	really disappointed
negative	in the last two years i have purchased a long wool cardigan and a polo neck jumper .
negative	within a few_days of wearing both items they became pilled and began to lose their shape .
negative	i was attracted by the photos of both items in woolovers catalogue .
negative	what a mistake !
negative	both items have fallen_apart , mainly under the arms and at the neck .
negative	i have repaired the cardigan myself . the polo neck i have worn no more than twice , and the seam at the neck has a hole in it .
negative	i am really appalled at the poor quality of both items given the prices .
negative	the polo neck sweater ; is supposedly lambs_wool but it is very itchy and unpleasant to wear .
negative	perhaps woolovers could_learn a few lessons in quality sweaters from places like marks and spencer and topshop .
negative	i wouldn_'_t bother shopping here .
negative	freezing_cold room .
negative	cubby under bed had hair and dirt inside .
negative	the toilet even had poo in it .
negative	shower was dirty .
negative	very poor even for a budget room .
negative	i wouldnt stay again or recommend .
negative	sent flowers to my parents as a thank_you .
negative	arrived on time but slimy and dead on arrival !
negative	disgusting - do not use serenata !
negative	placed order for a halloween_costume and was expecting it thursday .
negative	by friday we still hadn_'_t received it or an_email to confirm it '_s dispatched ( party was on saturday so cutting it fine !)
negative	all morning i constantly phoned but lines were engaged .
negative	sent an_email to which i '_ve still had no reply .
negative	when i finally got through on the phone , the woman said " i '_m sorry , we have f *** ed your order up literally ".
negative	she said the system didn_'_t pick_up the order , and it '_s now out of stock .
negative	i have asked for a full_refund and just hope they don_'_t mess that up either !
negative	good service going , friendly and prompt .
negative	however on return from a lovely holiday i was met with rudeness that turned into a very horrible situation where i felt intimidated and vulnerable .
negative	i would not recommend this particular car_park and drop_off to anyone .
negative	they ripped us off , saying the phone we sent was water_damaged when the litimus strip was fine when sent .
negative	i placed my order for a case of prosecco , told it was out of stock so would take about 0_weeks , which was fine but i wished i had taken this opportunity to cancel !
negative	this is what happened next , day of delivery finally arrived and they delivered just 0 bottles , my order was for 00 bottles .
negative	phoned up ( be warned you will be held on line for ages for customer_services , only option is to pretend you are placing another order this way you get to speak to someone !).
negative	finally got hold of andrew who agreed that they had messed_up the order and have charged me for 00 bottles but only delivered 0 , so i asked if they could deliver the next_day , he assured me that he had organised that and placed it on a morning delivery .
negative	needless to say i waited in all morning ; nothing arrived , called up at 00_noon only to be told that no delivery had been booked !!
negative	i then asked for a refund and for the rest of the order to be cancelled .
negative	two_days_later 0 bottles were delivered of a cheap prosecco i had not ordered and they don_'_t even have on their website .
negative	but if i had accepted this order i would have got 0 inferior bottles .
negative	i called them again , waited on line again only to be told that they hadn_'_t managed to cancel my order , and it had gone_through and on top of that it was a miss pick .
negative	what else could go_wrong i asked myself , i '_m still_waiting for my credit for the rest of the order , when i asked about this , their main_concern was to pick_up the 0 unwanted , poor substituted wine they were trying to off load onto me ...... when i said i would be in friday_morning but only up to 00am , they gave_me the great line but that isn_'_t very convenient for them !!!!!!!
negative	hilarious , it was fine for me to hang_around all morning waiting for them to not deliver but inconvenient when i work full time for them to book a pick_up when i gave them a 0 hour_window .......... my summery would be never , never order from this company , they are a complete_joke with no customer service .
negative	they point_blank refuse partial refunds ( groupon error with a money off code they sent me which they didnt honour ).
negative	they offered credit which still has not been added to my account .
negative	i have been chasing this since before christmas .
negative	poor communication , poor resolution .
negative	once they have your money they wont give it back .
negative	shocking .
negative	like many others i ordered items early_december for delivery before xmas .
negative	got the usual e_-_mails when querying where my order would be ' i '_ll look into it ' ' there '_s been a delay etc etc ' finally recieved 0 out of 0 things i had ordered , which i count myself lucky for , but am still ( after over a month ) awaiting a refund for two items , not a big one , but still .
negative	when they have bothered to respond it '_s ' i '_ve raised a refund request for you ' which never materialises .
negative	the imaginary ' scott ' who replies to your e_-_mails hasn_'_t even bothered doing so for a while .
negative	i '_ve sent them one final e_- mail to get a refund and as i have a solicitor in the family i have informed them i will be taking_legal_action_against them .
negative	i doubt they will even bother to reply ....
negative	wish i could give 0_stars .
negative	after shopping around for the best deal for a samsung_s0 zoom .
negative	i came_across carphone_warehouse with 0 deals available .
negative	an insert on the side of the deal said purchase samsung_s0 zoom you will receive the bundle pack free .
negative	recieved delivery of phone but no bundle pack .
negative	on emailing carphone_warehouse they told me i wasn_'_t entitled to the free gift .
negative	i found their whole manner very rude and will never use them again .
negative	especially as another 0 upgrades in this house this year .
negative	false_advertising comes to mind especially as all the deals shown did not include the bundle pack .
negative	we werent very happy with the flight , is a good price at the beginning but then it comes all the extras ..
negative	very expensive , they even charge for their headphones adaptor £ 0 is a rip_off !
negative	we went to mexico , so flight of 00_hours you need a lot if food to buy then .. we did get the menu but it wasnt enough .
negative	i paid for my seats as extra aswell and they said i didnt ( even_tho i checked my bank_account and they took it ), the lady at the airport so rude pushing and very insistent and that i didnt .. so i didnt get the seats i was 000_% sure i booked (£_00 lost there ) i want my money back from that !
negative	the worst was that they charge you £_00 per_person on your way out from the airport to come_back !
negative	it has to be in mexican pesos , cash , no receipts , they take your itinerary before you leave .
negative	this sounds_like a scam !!!
negative	why dont they charge you for that before hand , sounds_like cheating , stealing . mis just wrong .
negative	i spoke to the " secretaria de turismo " ( tourist board ) and they dont even know what i was talking_about !
negative	total_scam .
negative	hotel was ok but after evaluating and compering , the package wasnt cheap as we thought it was .
negative	we end up speanding an extra £_000 between flights to london to be able to fly form their airline , hotel in london because their flight is super early , foods , seats , transport from and to hotel - airport both locations , i can continue ...
negative	i will never book another holiday with them .
negative	i booked a car in cancun airport with sixt and nobody showed up to pick me up , they have no office in the actual airport .
negative	afterr 0_hr with my voucher and reference_number nobody know about the damn car , so i hire directly from hertz which was excellent .
negative	rentalcars . com or traveljigsaw which is the same , didnt give me a refund for not giving me the service , thats stealling !
negative	they charge me full_amount and after 0_months im still trying to get my money back !
negative	the dispute still on , but i will never ever rent a car from this company again .
negative	they suck .. save_yourself from this nightmare .
negative	i ordered from them once but was unhappy with the product .
negative	when complained about it - i received a very offensive and disrespectful answer saying that i have a " small_amount of knowledge that leads to lack of understanding certain things ...." and that my judgement regarding the product is erroneous .
negative	stay away if you want good quality products and a proper customer service .
negative	placed an order for a meal , and never received it .
negative	their website claims most blinds can be delivered within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	ordered 0 roman_blinds on 00 december - got a delivery date advised of 0 - 0 january - not quite 0 - 0_days but hey_ho , i didn ; t in fact need them until the first week in january .
negative	checked on the order tracker on 00th_january when i hadn_'_t received the blinds and it was still showing delivery estimate for 0 - 0 jan .
negative	emailed blinds 0 go and got this :
negative	hello elizabeth ,
negative	thank_you for your email .
negative	please_accept our apology for this , after chasing the order i have just been informed the fabric you have ordered is currently out of stock and is not due back into us until the 00th of january .
negative	i can fully understand how frustrating this must be for you .
negative	if you would like for the order to be sent sooner i can certainly request for some samples to be sent out if you would like to change the colour .
negative	please don_'_t_hesitate to contact us on 0000 000 0000 for us to discuss this further .
negative	best regards
negative	[_name_]
negative	unbelievable !
negative	firstly a minor_point but , nevertheless , why on earth would i want a different colour - isn_'_t the point of the blinds to match the decor of the room ?
negative	?
negative	when i spoke to [_name_] on the phone , she wasn_'_t apologetic at all - just a bit stroppy .
negative	firstly she said " we only found out this week the material isn_'_t in stock " - she was either too stupid to understand , or couldn_'_t be bothered to listen to me that they must have known at the end of december / 0st week in january that the material wasn_'_t in stock and therefore they weren_'_t going to make the delivery date but they didn_'_t even have the courtesy to let_me know .
negative	then she got stroppier saying " i don_'_t know where you got the date 0 - 0 january from " ( boy i wished i '_d printed that page out ) - you only ordered them on 0 january .
negative	i asked how can you explain my email order confirmation on 00th_december then ?
negative	after some mumbling i got " oh_yes it was the 00th_dec " after all .
negative	i asked for a refund and was told it would go back on to my card and then she put the phone down on me .
negative	the most annoying thing is if they had just told me the material wasn_'_t in stock up front i could have gone_elsewhere and got them in time .
negative	totally appalling customer service .
negative	avoid them like the plague .
negative	absolutely unacceptable customer service delivered through 0 of the leeds based stores .
negative	it seems in store staff are untrained ????
negative	when speaking to customers you should be sympathetic to their needs and not simply patronise customers for not understanding something .
negative	i would definitely never recommend halford stores in leeds for anything to do with cycles !!!
negative	shocking customer service and extremley poor support from the head_office too !
negative	as i was making my order on the online designer , it went fine .
negative	i then got an_email_saying that i had to send my order through email and i had to explain to them what i wanted , as the design wouldn_'_t work for some bizarre reason .
negative	i first ordered a medium top , and it turned_out to be a size 0 !!
negative	when on the store it said a medium was 00 / 00 .
negative	i then worte to them , complaining and they offered to send me one in a larger_size .
negative	so i ordered an extra large top , which was meant to be a size 00 , turns_out to be a size 00 !
negative	!
negative	once i recieved the second top , the top is very see - through , the material is stiff and the printing is awful !
negative	where the image stretches across my chest , it is all jagged and looks terrible !!
negative	!
negative	flowers weren_'_t delivered , unable to contact them via phone .
negative	told via_email that they have been delivered , still_awaiting answers as to where they are .
negative	would never use them again !
negative	i booked a hotel through booking . com for myself and my 0 friends the cost when booking was £_000 in total so i took £_000 each off my friends , when i booked , the hotel took a £_000 . 00 deposit to secure the rooms / first night however i was expecting them to take the full_amount straight_away , this is not made clear on the website that it would not be all taken straight_away .
negative	when i called the customer service department the operator made me feel like i was stupid not knowing that i would have to pay the remaining_balance on the day at the hotel at the exchange_rate given by the hotel .
negative	when arriving at the hotel i was told that i had to pay £_000 to make up the full bill so £_000_+ £_000 = £_000 an extra £_00 more then when i actually booked the hotel on the website !
negative	i felt like an_idiot so i didn_'_t ask the girls for anymore money so have forked out the extra £_00 myself .
negative	i booked through booking . com because it worked out £ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .
negative	i ordered a bouquet of flowers for my mum for mothers_day & selected a delivery date of saturday ( because there was no delivery option of sunday !!)
negative	they turned_up on friday and they were the wrong ones !
negative	not only were they the wrong ones but the roses were brown on the ends of the petals .
negative	i have sent two emails and have lost track of the amount of minutes i have been on hold during my work time due to the inconvenient opening_hours and have had no response .
negative	it '_s unacceptable and absolutely_shocking .
negative	avoid at all costs !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a bouquet for my only sister at christmas time and only good thing i can say about it is that it arrived when requested .
negative	the flowers were of very poor quality and there were hardly_any !
negative	dispite ordering the larger_size bouquet .
negative	i realised that not all the flowers would be the same as the picture on the website , but nothing was the same not even the all the colours .
negative	i would never use them again as i wrote an_email to them complaining and they did even bother to reply .
negative	this company needs to get their act_together , i '_ve been tracking my parcel from the beginning of when it got shipped , as soon as it hit this uk_based company things just went to the dogs !
negative	they can '_t find my parcel when the status said they tried to deliver it the day before and i was home the hold day no ups , rang them i was promised 000_% my parcel will get delivered the next_day as i stressed it was important i received it .
negative	the next evening still no parcel , rang again !
negative	for them to tell me they are sorting it out to with the driver .
negative	( at 0pm !!!)
negative	they told me they will call back , no one called so rang again now the 0th time .
negative	some useless customer service lady tells_me the package was not scanned .
negative	i told her i '_ve been tracking this package over a week and it said each time scanned how can she tell me it '_s not scanned ?
negative	and their status kept changing untruthfully saying i said .
negative	told me there isn_'_t nothing i could do or nothing she could do .
negative	i have to call the sender .
negative	i told her it is friday_evening the sender must be close until monday .
negative	she had the nerve to tell me phone them on monday then .
negative	i a rude tone .
negative	i just hang up it didn_'_t make_sense keep talking to that useless woman .
negative	i found their customer service very poor and ignorant .
negative	i '_ve cried so hard .
negative	i can '_t_believe_how they treat their customers .
negative	never send nothing with them .
negative	i don_'_t recommend this company what so ever !
negative	i shop a lot online and this company is the worst company i '_ve dealt_with .
negative	but experience well learnt .
negative	please_avoid them at all cost !
negative	i ordered an xbox it was broken , i returned it after waiting several days for it to be collected , then after a week of not hearing from them and them pretending to ring me back i rang them again and insisted on a refund , i still have no refund as promised on friday .
negative	i was told it would be refunded that day .
negative	i have emailed customer service this evening regarding my order flowers were awful and i was very embarrassed that my nan had received what she did
negative	the number of retailers you can use with quidco is excellent and it is very easy to set_up .
negative	yes the but is coming ...
negative	i have made two purchases with quidco , both online for tp toys and currys and both tracked .
negative	i have now gone past the dates listed for when payment could be expected and now they don_'_t show an expected date at all .
negative	seems a bit_suspicious that neither has worked , i wouldn_'_t recommend this service to anyone .
negative	went in store to ask a few questions about what deals / tariffs they have got and the staff_member said , " just a minute " looked away and started talking to his friend at the counter , 0 minutes later i was walking down the road .
negative	thoroughly distgusted .
negative	i was promised on 0 occasions i '_d have a call re paul green shoes i had ordered for my mum .
negative	i then called to talk to the manager .
negative	who i might_add was delightful and very honest .
negative	he also promised to call me back the following_day .
negative	he didn_'_t .
negative	nail in the coffin for me .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	find your shoes somewhere_else !
negative	this company is awful the customer_services to start with is great because they want the sele but the person i was bookin with was ( new ) and gave_me incorrect information and didn_'_t tell me the important things .
negative	i had called many_times trying to correct the mess they made .
negative	in the end so many things were incorrect we wanted to cancel and book the hen_weekend somewhere_else i was told we could not get a refund even_tho the services was awful and we were miss sold the weekend .
negative	once they have your money they want nothing more to do with you .
negative	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before if i had known they were this bad i could have saved_myself and other hens a lot of time a stress .
negative	do not use hen_heaven .
negative	this company is absolute garbage !
negative	firstly i tried to return a top and easily arranged a return on their site and a message came up saying it would be collected within 0_days !
negative	over a week_later i arranged another return when my top hadn_'_t been collected .
negative	another week_later i emailed them and got the response that i should just post it to them !
negative	which i point_blank refused to do .
negative	i thought this was a disgrace .
negative	they offer a returns pick_up and this has_been faulty so they thought they '_d just ask me to go to the hassle of going to the post_office and posting it .
negative	no !!!
negative	so i arranged another return and over a week_later it still wasn_'_t collected , by this time my complaint had been passed on to several different people , neither of which helped_me .
negative	then i arranged a fourth return and finally it was picked_up over a month after the first return was arranged .
negative	i also wasn_'_t sent a statement through post or email_telling_me when my payment was due so i missed this payment and was charged a £_00 administration_fee and was also charged a late fee of £ 0 . 00 for returning items late which i asked them repeatedly to take off my account .
negative	i have now gave up fighting this as they are completely_incompetent and could be fighting for a year before their complaints team gets back to me so i will be paying my bill and deleting my account .
negative	i will never shop with this company again and would advisie others not to shop with them .
negative	their customer service is an_absolute_disgrace and are totally_incompetent !
negative	worst place i have ever shopped !
negative	never again !
negative	their prices are much more_expensive than the likes of yours clothing which has always had great customer service .
negative	signed_up as a new customer had an issue on account requesting an_appointment date otherwise services will be delayed .
negative	contacted talk_talk passed from one person to another nobody had a clue then to be told their online service was very easy to use and i should have dates ???
negative	!
negative	after half an_hour of going round in circles i will not be joining .
negative	idiots !!
negative	!
negative	ordered a mural item was shipped 0_days ago still not received !
negative	i sent 0 parcels on the standard service to be delivered within the 0 - 0_days .
negative	both were supposedly collected from the store on the tuesday and then again on the thursday now how the hell can you collect the same parcels twice and 0_days apart !!!!!.
negative	took 0_days to travel the grand_total of 0miles to then say sent again twice . called after 0_days promised an_email back big surprise didn_'_t get one .
negative	the one parcel finally got there very late and i had a very irrate customer .
negative	my other parcel they sent via a 0rd_party courier , tracking now stopped and no way of knowing when or if arrives .
negative	this was my first and last ever time of using these_cowboys .
negative	i will tell anyone not to use this crap service , don_'_t know how they getting away with it with trading_standards .
negative	to sum up total cowboy_outfit !!!
negative	! don_'_t use
negative	we booked a ferry for 00_pm so that we had plenty of time to make it .
negative	we were 0 hours away from calais when we got a text_message_saying that the ferry was cancelled and we would be accommodated on one leaving at 0pm and we were asked to check in by 0 pm .
negative	everything would be fine if it wasn_'_t for the fact that we only got the text at 0 . 00_pm !!!
negative	thankfully , when we got to calais we managed to persuade a lady checking us in to let us sail on the next available ferry !
negative	we never had these problems with bookings made directly through dfdseaways but we were forced to use directferries this time .
negative	disappointed !
negative	i was sent a damaged item and was told i couldn_'_t have a refund or an exchange .
negative	this website had some lovely flowers available for the same delivery as long as i ordered before 0pm .
negative	i then received an_email late that evening to say they was unable to send due to availability in the area .
negative	if that was the case i expect to know more or less straight_away so i can make other arrangements .
negative	its the first time i tried to use them & unfortunately it will be my last as i have no trust in this company ..
negative	absolutely rubbish they put down they couldnt deliver to me today as they couldnt get access to my property i live in a bloody close they are just lazy and dont evan come into our village half the time they just send it back to sender ive been ordering xmas_presents i proberly wont get all my catologues use yodel if they want to keep customers they should get_rid
negative	my son wanted to buy 0ds with his_birthday money , ordered it may_0000 , like others have said , when they eventually answered an_email kept saying would be despatched in 00_hours , never received anything , very quick to take money out of your account , not so quick at answering the telephone .
negative	i am so glad that i had the hindsight to buy it on my visa_card .
negative	anyway after over 0_months disappointment , i had had enough and i contacted my bank and had to fill out some forms detailing all my emails and the correspondence i got back from them , and i received refund in full from my bank , we then managed to buy a 0ds much_cheaper with extra games from well_known high_street store .
negative	ordered flowers for a friend '_s birthday .
negative	text said they '_d been dispatched at 00am .
negative	i had to end up telling her as knew she was going out at 0pm and they were still no where to be seen .
negative	the tracking code wasn_'_t working and the only contact number is staffed_by robots who say ' we can '_t help you goodbye ' if they don_'_t understand your voice recognition .
negative	the flowers arrived just before 00pm .
negative	she was out so they were left hidden in recycling bins .
negative	hardly the lovely surprise i '_d planned .
negative	i ordered goods on the 0th_april and have still not received them .
negative	today is the 00nd of april .
negative	when i rang i was told i had to wait 00 working_days , then i received and email from customer_care saying i have to wait_until the 0th_may before they can even track the package .
negative	i live in madrid and have used another chemist who always gets my medication to me in 0 to 0_days .
negative	i would not reccomend or use chemist_direct ever again .
negative	never received item ordered for a birthday_present .
negative	told it was a problem with courier .
negative	after_contacting customer service on a couple of occasions and when they could still not say when the item would be delivered i told them to cancel order and refund my money which eventually they did .
negative	this was the first time i had ordered anything from superdry and it will definitely be the last time .
negative	never again .
negative	i made an order for a chair on 00 / 00 / 00 and cancelled it the same evening .
negative	since then have sent repeated emails and have had several conversations with people who tell me i can expect a full_refund in a few_days time .
negative	having looked into the company further i think the people i spoke to work for another company , and that infurn are a very dodgy set_up .
negative	i reported them to the british police for fraud .
negative	i since found out several others have dine the same and that they are being investigated .
negative	i suggest you think very carefully before parting with any money to this company .
negative	signed_up for a contract in store where i explicitly stated multiple_times i did not want insurance with the phone .
negative	the guy serving me said i had to sign an insurance document for geek squad to receive the contract , " just so they have my details " and " to give me a complimentary 0 week insurance period ".
negative	i told him again i did not want insurance .
negative	he again said it was compulsory .
negative	lo and behold 0_months later i have been direct debited for 0_months of insurance i explicitly said i did not want .
negative	cpw and geek squad said i should have cancelled it after the 0_weeks but i did not know i had been signed_up .
negative	after an investigation they never refunded me either .
negative	so basically , cpw servers are liars ( i know they work on commission but it '_s no excuse ) who will do anything to make a sale .
negative	add terrible customer service to the mix and insurance that appears worthless judging_by the other reviews and all in all , i expect them cpw to collapse very soon if this is how they treat customers .
negative	returning to giffgaff when my contract is up .
negative	iam never going to use the website again i had to wait a week and a half for my money nd im not at all empressed soo if use are goin to use this i should make_sure that you read everything before sendin your phones
negative	i ordered a costume for my daughter on aug 0th .
negative	i had a confirmation straight_away and an update saying awaiting fulfilment .
negative	since then nothing .
negative	they are still showing the same costume as available on their website and i have had no contact from them telling_me that there is a delay .
negative	i '_ve e_- mailed twice and have tried to call everyday and like others say there is no response or it just cuts off .
negative	absolutely useless customer service .
negative	i '_m going to be calling my card company to ask them to charge the money back to the company as based on most reviews here they are doing this a lot and seem to be crooks .
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered on a very specific day .
negative	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
negative	they never appeared , there was no email_saying that the flowers had not been delivered , there was no phone_call .
negative	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
negative	customer service are hopeless , can not tell you what happened , have no accountability and send you the same tired email time after time .
negative	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
negative	i have just noticed that mine and many other reviews from the last couple of days have been removed .
negative	we all had non - delivery of our flowers !!!!!
negative	and no reply to our emails .
negative	there is no reason for you to remove these reviews we said nothing other than the truth !!
negative	!
negative	would never recommend these people and will_continue to write these reviews until you respond to me !!!
negative	i am not putting it on facebook at the moment but will do if i do not hear from you today !
negative	i am so sick of explaining my problems with bt that i won_'_t bore anyone with the detail .
negative	but suffice it to say that i have today spoken to trading_standards and they say i have a case .
negative	they have delivered me nothing but headaches peppered with 00 minute fruitless and frustrating calls to their customer helpline , broken_promises and shoddy service .
negative	don_'_t do it ... you '_d find doing smoke signals to communicate a lot more efficient .
negative	i ordered and paid for a tunic on 0th_september , expecting delivery in the following week .
negative	by the end of september it still hadn_'_t arrived so i sent an_email , followed_by a phone_call to the office .
negative	it is now the 00th_october and i have had no replies to the 0 emails i have sent and no one has bothered to contact me following the two calls i have made - i assured someone would look into it and call me back .
negative	i will_continue to chase this !
negative	ordered my mum some flowers .
negative	delivery was booked for 00 / 00 / 00 and nothing arrived .
negative	extremely unsatisfied .
negative	can '_t even get through to speak to anyone to complain .
negative	dont touch them with a barge_pole , the old saying you only get what you pay for works with this company .
negative	when i called to say i had received the wrong item ( evn though the delivery note was right ) i found the customer service agent not apologetic and with a dont care attitude .
negative	i bought a pair of trainers and unfortunately they didn_'_t fit my boyfriend .
negative	when i tried to exchange them i was a few_days over their 00 day policy .
negative	i foolishly purchased online without reviewing the policy but presumed they would be in line with their main_competitors .
negative	this was not the case ......
negative	so now i have a pair of trainers that won_'_t fit and even although they are still a current line they have refused to exchange them !
negative	better customer service can definitely be found elsewhere !
negative	a very bad service , from the claim department , who lie about receiving the documents i sent over 000 times .
negative	gave_me 0 different emails to send it to then said it was to late .
negative	then said the packaging was not right .
negative	this is all evasion tactics not to pay the claim .
negative	very dishonest company .
negative	do not use this company ever
negative	appalling charge for using debit_cards by the time all the charges you incur fling schedule with ba ect is not much more exspensive when you consider your costs for travel on to your flight to get you to yuor destination oout of the way airports used
negative	i booked several parcels on the same day with different carriers , theough parcel0go .
negative	the myhermes man turned_up and insisted on taking a parcel that was not booked through myhermes and which had a tnt label on it .
negative	my employee tried to explain , but the driver was insistent to the point of agression that he had to take the parcel .
negative	i rang parcel0go within 0 minutes of this , but myhermes did not respond .
negative	several days of parcel0go telling_me that " myhermes would not respond within 00_hours " ensued .
negative	but myhermes did not respond at all .
negative	they then lost my parcel but refused to pay compensation .
negative	as a result i lost a valued regular customer .
negative	all in all a total disgrace , would never use them again ..
negative	i was sent an offer through and even_though i had had a bad customer service experience with them previously decided i would give them another try .
negative	i put in my offer code which they said may not show straight_away but would be applied to my statement ....
negative	however , when i received my statement i have been charged in full .
negative	i rang customer service and was told to email .... why when i am talking to you ?????
negative	they then said that the offer code was on spends of £_00 + but no one on the ' online ' voucher was this states i read these things carefully .
negative	i now interestingly cannot access this ' online voucher '.
negative	i feel that they dangle carrots and then do not follow through ... this to me is fraudulant ... there customer service is appalling .
negative	sent a blackberry_0000 almost 0_weeks_ago . was told payment would be made today ( 00st_jan ) still no payment !
negative	ridiculous seeing as they said 0 working_days !
negative	appauling customer service .... also says on site on my account not paid . before they say they have !.......................
negative	latest update , they emailed to say money would be in bank today as promised !
negative	! with a 0 pound goodwill_gesture on top ( why thankyou .. not ).
negative	still no money !
negative	! and have re - emailed them0 times !!
negative	!
negative	friend from california sent me a gift of a photo on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	on 00 / 00 i receive a note from parcelforce demanding import vat and a clearance fee ( the latter being £_00 . 00 ).
negative	no pay , no delivery .
negative	fine .
negative	i followed their instructions , went to their website , paid the toll , and arranged for next_day delivery .
negative	nothing turned_up .
negative	and nothing has as i write nearly a month later .
negative	i just rang to complain , chose the option to speak to a real_person and was immediately disconnected !
negative	tried again , got shown the exit again .
negative	utterly dispiriting service , like the worst of the0000s .
negative	parcelforce would seem to be the antithesis of what the privatised royal_mail say their standards are .
negative	the second time i tried to order something i was told that my email address & password didn_'_t exist so i set_up another account .
negative	this happened every time i tried to use them .
negative	last time i got a feedback request form which i couldn_'_t fill out .
negative	when i asked why it was because i had ' so many accounts .'
negative	i pointed_out that this was down to them .
negative	i '_m still_awaiting a reply .
negative	i have to say i had a horrendous_experience using viagogo and will never use them again .
negative	i purchase expensive tickets to watch tennis at the 00 ( total value £_000 ).
negative	i purchased them several months before the event .
negative	viagogo said they would be despatched nearer the time but didn_'_t specify when .
negative	i don_'_t check my emails every_single day but do check them fairly regularly .
negative	i had missed checking them one day , logged in the next_day and found that there were two emails from viagogo .
negative	the emails said that delivery ( via ubs ) had failed .
negative	the emails advised that i should contact ubs urgently and that if the third and final delivery failed my tickets would be destroyed .
negative	yes destroyed - my £_000 tickets .
negative	i rang ubs in a hurry and asked them to deliver them to my work instead , as i am not in during the day .
negative	for some unknown_reason ubs were unable to deliver at my workplace .
negative	it was friday by this time .
negative	i next checked my emails on sunday and there was an_email from viagogo saying the third delivery had failed and unless i called by 0 pm on sunday the tickets would be destroyed .
negative	the message read : ups have tried to deliver your ticket ( s ) but have not been able to do so after 0 delivery attempts .
negative	unless you contact ups by 0 pm today , the envelope containing your tickets will be destroyed and you will not be reimbursed .
negative	all of us and needless to say yourself would certainly prefer that you go to see your favourite event !
negative	i was besides myself with worry for the rest of the day with the thought that the tickets were destroyed and wondering how i would break the news to friends who had paid for flights to travel down to london .
negative	i called ubs the next_day and they said no of course they wouldn_'_t destroy a packet .
negative	if three delivery attempts fail , they will keep it in their warehouse .
negative	they arranged a delivery the next_day that was successful .
negative	i was staggered by the whole affair .
negative	firstly why do viagogo give no advance_warning that the tickets will be delivered ?
negative	secondly why on earth would they think it '_s acceptable to destroy tickets after three failed deliveries ?
negative	people could be away or just not check their emails .
negative	and thirdly why go telling people their tickets will be / have been destroyed when that isn_'_t true ?
negative	i am literally amazed and think viagogo is a joke .
negative	i placed an order of around 000 prints on 00th_march to put in an album for a 00th_birthday_gift .
negative	i was looking for a next_day delivery service so searched on google .
negative	i saw that jessops have a service where you can order and pick_up in store from as little as 00_minutes later .
negative	i placed my order and expected to pick it up the following_day from the glasgow store ( i live in edinburgh , but was going to be in glasgow the next_day ).
negative	i contacted the store to check if they were ready and was then told that there are two different websites , jessops and jessops_photo .
negative	i had read about the 00 minute pick_up on jessops site and had then ordered through jessops_photo .
negative	this is obviously quite an easy mistake to have made and i think this distinction should be made a lot clearer on both websites .
negative	i contacted jessops_photo and as i was not going to be in glasgow apart_from that day , i asked for the photos to be sent to my home address .
negative	they advised me that they would need to be received by the store , then returned by courier to headquarters , then posted to me .
negative	after numerous_emails it was confirmed that they were enroute back to the store and would be posted to me immediately .
negative	however , five weeks on i still don_'_t have any photos .
negative	in the mean time i have requested a refund on several_occasions .
negative	i was initially told that a refund was not possible .
negative	however i have now been told that the photos are still in store and i will be refunded and a discount_code has_been offered to cover postage_costs .
negative	however i will most definitely not be paying any money to use the jessops_photo service .
negative	the photos have now been printed so i have requested that these be sent to me as well as receiving a refund .
negative	i wanted to share my experience on this site as i haven_'_t found the responses via_email in anyway satisfactory .
negative	it sounded great when i was completing the forms .
negative	ziffit wanted several of my medical and self help books .
negative	i missed a few the first time and ended_up with two batches to submit .
negative	compared to the money i '_d paid , i was going to get peanuts for them but my payment would pay for another book or two and i was getting them off my shelves .
negative	to save ziffit some postage and to save having to pack out half a box with waste paper , i packaged both batches in one box .
negative	i put both postage_labels on the top though and a note_inside saying that there were two batches in the box .
negative	so why was i not surprised when an acknowledgement came through for just one of the batches .
negative	00 days_later , i am still fighting to get ziffit to acknowledge that there was a second_batch of books in that box .
negative	i always learn my lessons the hard way !
negative	will never buy from physio_room again .
negative	to wait a whole month for a refund with no communication sent to me is unacceptable .
negative	had bought from here before ( about 0 years_ago ) and had no problem but then again i had no refunds to received , it was just an order which i kept so maybe the problem here is with returns ...
negative	i have previously purchased ecco_shoes in their uk high_street stores , so was surprised to find that this order arrived from the continent .
negative	unfortunately they were unsuitable so have had to be returned , at significant personal cost , to sweden .
negative	i think that during the ordering process it should have been made clear that i was undertaking a costly international purchase which i would not have chosen to do .
negative	i do not feel inclined to make any future_purchases .
negative	i purchased a groupon deal a couple of weeks_ago for a holiday .
negative	i paid via_paypal and instantly received an_email receipt from paypal although my groupon account was saying that payment was unsuccessful .
negative	i emailed groupon customer support and got a response the following_day basically saying that the blame was with paypal , as there was a delay in authorising it ( even_though my paypal_account had instantly showed that payment was successful ) and they suggested that , in future , i should pay by credit_card instead .
negative	they completely_ignored the fact that money had been taken and i had not received a voucher !
negative	i emailed them back saying i would like the voucher or my money back soonest as the deal was due to expire .
negative	their response was that they were sorry i '_d had such a bad_experience and if there was anything more they could do then to let them know ... again , ignored my request for either the voucher or my money back ( which i told them again )!
negative	!
negative	by the way , during this time , the offer ( pending voucher ) had completely disappeared from ' my purchases ' on my groupon account and also , the only way i could log_into my account was by going to purchase another deal .
negative	if i tried signing in the normal way , it didn_'_t recognise me - even when i requested a password reminder !
negative	apparently my email address wasn_'_t in their records !
negative	pffff !
negative	anyway , i received an_email from a different person from groupon asking for my paypal transaction details so that they can locate the payment which i gave to them 0_days ago and still nothing heard back .
negative	so frustrating !
negative	!
negative	fortunately for me as this was paid for with paypal , i have been able to open a dispute case via them so it '_s now in the trustful hands of paypal to get my money back for me .
negative	this has caused me no end of stress , anger and upset especially as this holiday is for myself and 0 other people .
negative	i made solmar villa '_s ( the company the deal was for ) aware of the situation and i cannot thank them enough for their excellent customer service !
negative	which is a lot more than i can say for groupon .
negative	have ordered meat a few_times and quality has_been fine - particularly_like the chicken_breasts .
negative	the delivery of each order has let the whole_thing down - boxes left on doorsteps , behind the bin etc .
negative	the most recently delivery was attempted to an incorrect_address then dropped_off at the corner_shop ( our preferred place when we are not at home , at_least they got that right this time ).
negative	no card was put through the door ( or perhaps it was put through the wrong door ) - the shop put the box in a hot windowless room and we were not aware it was there .
negative	when we were advised about it a day or so later - the sole iceblock had melted and we had a box of rotten meat .
negative	westin are so far unwilling to take any responsibility for their delivery and so we have wasted money on rancid meat .
negative	very unhappy and will not order again .
negative	the annoying thing is that my husband was working from home that day and had they knocked on the right door he would have been in to receive the parcel .
negative	this company run the biggest scam i have ever_seen .
negative	i ordered two contact_lens cases totalling just over_£ 0 , that was more than 0_weeks_ago .
negative	the product said in stock when i ordered it and they pride_themselves in delivering within 00 - 00_hours .
negative	this is a lie !!!
negative	a week_later i sent an_email to which they said they '_d chase it up .
negative	nothing .
negative	another week_later i called to which they said they '_d chase it up .
negative	nothing .
negative	another week_later the same thing .
negative	four_weeks_later i told them that while their website still said in stock for the item i '_d had nothing sent to me .
negative	i told them i wanted to cancel the order and was merrily told ok and they '_d send a confirmation_email of the cancellation .
negative	guess_what ?
negative	no confirmation_email , no refund of my money and still no delivery of the item .
negative	don_'_t waste your money on these villains .
negative	go to boots or your local_chemist and get whatever you need over the counter .
negative	ps i '_ve only given them 0 out of 0 for overall review and customer service because the review website insists you award something .
negative	my actual rating is 0 out of 0 !
negative	i ordered £ 0000 of furniture from mercuro six_weeks_ago .
negative	although ( before payment ) their customer service was fine , i have heard_nothing since placing the order - despite_repeated attempts to contact the company through their website by email and by phone .
negative	having done some_research ( which i should have done before purchasing ) it seems they have set_up in various guises over the last several_years and that i am by far not the only one who has experienced difficulties .
negative	my advice would be to spend a little more and buy your furniture from someone reputable .
negative	i now have to go through the lengthy procedure of trying to reclaim my money via my credit_card provider .
negative	first time i have ever bought anything on - line and i can_honestly_say my purchase from john_lewis was a disaster , the customer service would assure me of one thing and the complete_opposite happened .
negative	when i finally recieved my order the merchandise was faulty ( not fit for purpose ).
negative	i used john_lewis as i thought it was a reputable_firm !
negative	!
negative	ordered the peace bouquet and had them sent to my mother as a gift as i could not travel to her_birthday .
negative	my sister sent me a picture of the flowers as they looked so poor .
negative	i then contacted serenta to complain , got sent round the houses and then never got a reply after sending them the image they requested .
negative	my mum said the roses were dead by the third day too .
negative	this is my experience i have gave them the chance to rectify but heard_nothing .
negative	will not use again first and last .
negative	howere i have a friend who had a good experience , every cloud !
negative	the single worst online shopping_experience ever .
negative	wish you could give no stars .
negative	ordered online , no delivery a week_later .
negative	went_onto facebook to ask for an update , apparently a field was left blank so delivery could not be made ( my fault , which i accept ) - however , no contact from thornton '_s or delivery company advising me of this , i had to chase them .
negative	i provided them with the information that was required and was assured that delivery would be quick .
negative	another week_later and still no delivery and still no update from thornton '_s , except that they we ' re sorry for the experience and they strive for ' excellent customer service '....?!
negative	0_days on and still no delivery .
negative	demanded refund , but clearly not expecting that to come anytime_soon , nor do i expect to receive any communication about it .
negative	have had to make alternative_arrangements now and has turned_out cheaper and better .
negative	don_'_t even get me started on the customer service in store as well .
negative	for a brand such as thornton '_s they need to sort this out immediately - go onto their facebook and just see the amount of complaints and their distinct lack of adequate complaint resolutions .
negative	save your money and go elsewhere .
negative	or if you like thornton '_s , buy their chocolate from tesco .
negative	won_'_t be using serenata_flowers again as i had no respond to my last email which was sent yesterday about 0 . 00pm
negative	ordered item , order accepted money paid , then i get a despatched confirmation_email , 0 hours after that i get a ' you have been refunded ' email with the reason ' cannot find item '.. that is all fair and well but a ) why send me a despatched email and b ) 0 of there stores have the same model item so why not source one from one of those store so as to not inconvenience a customer ...
negative	i ordered a few items from a clothing company who use yodel as their couriers .
negative	big mistake on their part , i probably_won_'_t use this clothing company again whilst they continue to use yodel .
negative	my order was paid for , for express delivery and according to yodels website , was due to be delivered on 00 . 0 . 00 .
negative	it got to 0pm and no delivery .
negative	and it was still stating it was in their main service centre .
negative	not my local .
negative	so i rang .
negative	to be told , it '_s possibly lost .
negative	they '_ll forward my issue and i '_ll hear back from them , then they hung_up phone .
negative	so i waited for them to return my call ( they hung_up instead of transferring me ) i didn_'_t hear back so i rang again .
negative	this time i told them that i needed it delivered to my work address the following_day ( i wasn_'_t happy about this .
negative	i paid for express delivery for my holiday !!!).
negative	the man told me he was making notes and this would be possible .
negative	however , told me someone would call me to sort it tomorrow and only took a postcode to check this was in same catchment area .
negative	next_day , i waited for a call .
negative	no call !
negative	i rang again !
negative	now they ' re telling_me there '_s no address on my parcel , only the town .
negative	( this was lies , i got thr parcel eventually and there is an address !).
negative	i gave them details and told them it needed to be delivered before 000pm to work address .
negative	0pm arrives .
negative	i ring to find out the status of my delivery .
negative	the man has complete attitude !
negative	saying well it '_s only 0pm .
negative	obviously ( he said this ).
negative	it won_'_t be there yet .
negative	i was fuming .
negative	000pm arrives .
negative	no parcel again .
negative	i ring again .
negative	now they give me couriers number .
negative	the courier hadn_'_t been told to deliver to my work address , despite me telling 0 different people where it was to go !!!
negative	unfortunately , the courier lady was lovely , so it '_s not her fault , but yodel as a company are useless !
negative	i am awaiting contact about 0 different complaints i have made regarding their poor customer service .
negative	and the attitude of their employees .
negative	the one with attitude ) only started apologising once i told him i want to make a complaint about him .
negative	but it '_s fine , because all calls are recorded , so they will be able to see !
negative	avoid yodel !
negative	yodel are quick enough to check these reviews , but not quick enough to sort_out any complaints or issues they cause !
negative	i ordered 0 items from them , on 0 . 0 . 00 .
negative	it is now 00 . 0 . 00 and according to their website , my items are in progress .
negative	so they haven_'_t even been packaged , let_alone sent out !
negative	i emailed three_times , and rang twice .
negative	to which i have had no reply .
negative	their phone just claims there is no one to take your call .
negative	this is a complete scam company .
negative	they took my money quick enough and straight_away !
negative	i '_m lucky i paid through paypal as i '_m opening a dispute !
negative	do not use this company .
negative	you will lose out !
negative	i ordered my item on the 0th_april and after numerous_emails and calls no one has called me back to let_me know where my item is as the money has_gone out of my bank
negative	i undertand we have had easter and there would be a delay but nearly a month
negative	i did like using wowcher but after the service i have experienced i will not be using it again
negative	i tried to post the following review on the customer review section of the golden_tours website last_week but surprise , surprise , it does not appear - only the 0_star reviews have made it past their moderator !
negative	goldentours booked me on a tour of the queen elizabeth olympic park in june_0000 , but when i turned_up , i was told by the security guards that the tour no_longer existed .
negative	there has_been little in the way of an_apology from golden_tours and i have had to contact them twice just to obtain a refund of the ticket price .
negative	i would have expected a reputable_company at the very least to have offered to cover my travel costs and compensated me for my wasted time - never mind the disappointment - but nothing has_been forthcoming .
negative	not impressed with golden_tours .
negative	over 00 months the tv didn_'_t work , the internet was on and off and they charged to fix it and then it still didn_'_t work > cost me 000 to reconnect my phone line after they put it on their own line > a really bad_experience >
negative	i wrote to them at_least ten times and all they said was " tough " well tough on you tiscali , here '_s my review of you
negative	no proper contact and line was suspended even_tho i had tried to pay bill rubbish service
negative	not only was my parcel delivered to the wrong_address but when opened it was all smashed up .
negative	also screws where missing and no instructions for some of the items .
negative	also emailed this company and had no response at all ...
negative	i am returning my product because i paid for my delivery to come between 0 and 0_days and delivery came here , did not knock and left a card .
negative	i lost the chance to give my order as a gift .
negative	never will buy with this website anymore .
negative	i just could get it in the post_office 0_days after my shop on line .
negative	it '_s been over two_weeks and i still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	customer_services don_'_t seem interested and haven_'_t replied to my emails .
negative	not impressed .
negative	definitely won_'_t be using this website again .
negative	i will definitely not be using expedia again .
negative	i booked a spa break at the stratford manor only to get there bad find that i had been booked into the stratford which didn_'_t have a spa !
negative	the hotels were great but said we had to go through_expedia to change the hotel .
negative	expedia tried to tell me it was a much more_expensive hotel and i would have to pay extra but i argued with them .
negative	there was a language problem with the call when i booked and the call to transfer hotels , with the guy saying " but you are already booked into the stratford "!!
negative	i spent the first hour of the weekend_break trying to get through to expedia but spent most of it on hold .
negative	put order on 00 / dec /_0000 .
negative	told me the expected delivery date to snowinn '_s warehouse is 00 / dec /_0000 .
negative	today is 00 / dec /_0000 , the order status is still " awaiting stock "!!
negative	!
negative	unfortunately did not find this website before using sospecial .
negative	have been waiting since august 0th for order costing nearly_£_00 . 00 .
negative	all i '_ve received are numerous polite apologies .
negative	why are they allowed to trade ?
negative	am going to ask trading_standards for advice .
negative	after purchasing and paying and order acknowledged i was then told item was not in stock and was not given a date when i would receive the sunglasses , as these were for a holiday i had to cancel the order and buy from elsewhere - not happy
negative	item ordered described as genuine ugg_boots .
negative	they were not .
negative	man - made outer and inners .
negative	had them delivered to a friend in uk who forwarded them to me in france and then i had to return them as they were so awful .
negative	postage cost around £_00 .
negative	total and utter_rubbish .
negative	order number 00000
negative	i bought a camilla toilet just over a year_ago .
negative	ive had to pay £_000 in plumber fees due to the cistern being of such cheap quality that it kept allowing water to trickle into the pan .
negative	the first time all the washers were replaced , then the whole workings had to be replaced and not from bathshop but wickes .
negative	now im told by the plumber that i shouldnt have to take the whole toilet off the floor and wall in order to tighten the seat .
negative	which ive had to do 0 times in a year and now the butterfly fixings wont tighten at all .
negative	the toilet_seat is incorrect .
negative	so back to bathshop and [_name_] stated that there should be 0 buttons in the lud to lift the seat off .
negative	ive taken and sent photos to prove i do not have these buttons .... she '_s said ' you had the correct seat .
negative	its out of warranty and a new one is £_00 '!!!
negative	ive e ' mailed and called and she says her supplier says its the right seat !
negative	it definitely isnt !
negative	reading other people '_s reviews that bathshop regularly pack the incorrect parts at_least means im not going mad .
negative	:-/ [_name_] won_'_t let_me speak to anyone_else at bathshop about it .
negative	she says she '_s the general_manager .
negative	im left with a useless toilet and the only choice is to spend even more on correcting their mistake on a completely_useless product !!!!
negative	naff customer service !
negative	ive called again today after a week of silence after [_name_] said she '_d speak to the supplier again .
negative	i spoke to [_name_] who seemed to have resolved other complaints on here .
negative	he said he '_d look into it and get back to me .
negative	that was at 00 : 00 today .
negative	ive heard_nothing and its 00 : 00 .
negative	i '_m not impressed with peninsula , and so was interested when i received via_email from manchester confidential , an_email that said i could have " free employment law advice for employers based on the acas code of practice .
negative	speak to an adviser now – call 0000 000 0000 " and " employers direct is a free , 00 - 0 advice line for employers who need expert guidance on employment law ".
negative	so i called at 00 . 00pm on a week night and was told by the chap i spoke to that he was " on reception " and " not best placed to respond to the call ".
negative	i asked if this was not somewhat defeating the object of " 00 - 0 advice ".
negative	i got a woolly answer , so i asked directly if they were a subsidiary of peninsula business services and he wouldn_'_t answer , stating that he couldnt comment .
negative	well folks , if you work in law , where there '_s a total denial you '_ll get a straight answer .
negative	ergo , employers direct are a subsidiary of peninsula business services .
negative	you have been warned .
negative	by the way , looking for acas advice drawn from the code ?
negative	go to their website !
negative	that '_s what acas are for !
negative	sent an_email on monday re complaint as this company only works from 0 - 0 , no good to the people that work for a living !!
negative	still no reply , cant book a voucher , restaurant don_'_t want to know and refer you back to wowcher !!
negative	anyone going to respond !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered my replacement cartridges 0_weeks_ago .
negative	still not delivered and no communication to explain_why .
negative	we use your service the whole time and as usual we trusted you to provide the goods next_day .
negative	we ordered the goods on a tuesday , next_day delivery ready for a party that was on the saturday .
negative	nothing was delivered until saturday after a lot of phone_calls and finding out the package had gone to birmingham .
negative	we then had to change the delivery address to the client '_s home so that the package was certain to arrive in time .
negative	ordered flowers well in time for valentine '_s day then got an e_- mail at 00 :_00pm on the 00th_feb to say the courier can '_t find the address ?
negative	this being the very same address where sereneta have delivered before ?
negative	was offered a 00_%_off voucher for guaranteed valentine '_s day delivery .
negative	surprise , surprise , the flowers i ordered had doubled in price !!
negative	phoned the customer_services line .
negative	operator very unhelpful and said that they had loads of these incidents and nothing could be done apart_from a full_refund !
negative	wow , generous or what ?
negative	similar messages posted on social_media websites were somehow ' deleted ' sorry tippexed out mysteriously !
negative	i for one will never use them again .... goodbye sereneta , go and ruin someone_else '_s day !
negative	ordered a small item and it took 0_days to deliver to a destination of approximitely
negative	00 miles from posting
negative	will not do_business again
negative	freezes constantly .
negative	unwatchable
negative	i rewrote my review removing the " offensive and coarse " word , which was only a slang and every day word for cigarettes , commonly used in the uk and not deemed in any way offensive .
negative	you published that fact that the comment was removed for being offensive and coarse , did not republish the edited version and have my name on the forum still as being coarse .
negative	charming .
negative	dulux white emulsion is on a special_offer buy one get one half price so i wanted to buy two .
negative	it was not available to collect from store but had to be delivered with a 0 day delivery schedule .
negative	i thought the £ 0 . 00 delivery charge was similar cost to my petrol to my nearest_store anyway so decided to go_ahead .
negative	that was 0_days ago ...
negative	i had a text saying delivery was delayed but no definite information on when it will arrive .
negative	when will i be able to get on with the painting ?
negative	i won_'_t be buying anything_else from homebase that needs delivering !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a pocket organiser on 00th_january .
negative	i was told on the 0th_march that my order had been cancelled because the item was not currently available .
negative	consequently , i bought an organiser at a local shop .
negative	i then received an e_mail on the 00th_march to say my order had been dispatched !
negative	it is now the 00th_march and i still_haven_'_t received anything .
negative	i will never order anything through them again .
negative	i made an order on the 0th_october_0000 , it '_s now january_0000 and i still_haven_'_t received the whole order .
negative	part of what i did receive was damaged due to poor packing .
negative	it was food but the packaging was ripped_open so it was mouldy !
negative	i have tried_calling waeplus but there is never anyone on the phonelines and all my emails are met with silence .
negative	according to their website i can '_t have a refund whilst the order is ' partially delivered '.
negative	however , i think that waiting for 0_months is enough time to ask for a refund .
negative	the service has_been terrible and i feel like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
negative	update_:
negative	they finally got in touch with me in january , and said i could have a refund for the undelivered items but not the damaged items ( unless i posted them back - they were food items and i threw them out after a couple of weeks as i didn_'_t fancy hanging on to mouldy food ).
negative	in april i received a cheque , made out to the wrong name .
negative	they are either trying really hard not to give me any money back or are just incompetent .
negative	ultimate_appliances must be the worst internet based company i have ever had the misfortune to encounter .
negative	they delivered the item late , to the wrong_address and when re - scheduled , i travelled 000_miles to receive the item , which they were fully_aware of and they then decided they would not deliver at all .
negative	it is now some 0_weeks and i am still_waiting for a refund .
negative	this matter has now been placed into the hands of my solicitor and trading_standards .
negative	i have now been contacted my numerous other ultimate appliance customers who all have similar stories to tell .
negative	bbc rogue traders have now taken up this case - to date i have been contacted by no less_than 00 dissatisfied_customers who have lodged formal complaints against [_name_removed_] the managing_director of ultimate_appliances .
negative	if anyone_else has similarly suffered , please dont hesitate to get in contact with me .
negative	subsequent to my post i have received a threat of legal_action by the managing_director of this company in which he has attempted to intimidate me into silence .
negative	i will not be silenced .
negative	the facts are irrefutable .
negative	anyone_wishing to purchase from this retailer , should contact all of those customers who '_s reviews have been removed - contact trust_pilot to ask for the list .
negative	the majority of them will be willing to share their experiences which have been extremely negative .
negative	do your homework before buying from these people .
negative	i ended_up buying from john_lewis who were exceptional and i would never hesitate to use them in the future
negative	had the free broadband package with them most of the time it didn_'_t connect to the internet got so fed_up transferred to bt and had to pay for them to put in a new phone line as talk_talk had put a bar on it
negative	appaling service - probably fraud .
negative	i ordered a mattress_topper on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	they have taken the money from my credit_card , but i have heard_nothing from them since and no goods have been delivered ( now 00 / 0 / 00 ).
negative	do not order from this company .
negative	i had to cancel due to illness .
negative	trainline sold me insurance so i tried to claim .
negative	i have asked them over the last 0_weeks for written confirmation that i cancelled and just get the same old standard reply_saying my tickets are non_refundable .
negative	but i am not asking them for a refund but to claim on the insurance they sold me !!
negative	i have replied twice more and not had any response .
negative	i have now written to their operations director .
negative	o0 own this company and think its a great business plan to provide a service hiding_behind a new name " giffgaff " where they get the actual customer to provide all the support .
negative	if you think that is great then blimey :-)
negative	followed there instructions on how to unlock my iphone and what a shock it meant i had to take it to apple for a replacement .
negative	avoid !
negative	i ordered a hamper , paid the full_amount over the phone by credit_card , then received an e_mail saying i had bought it over 0 years , never even known you could do that , called them , you gotta cancel the first hamper , re order and your have to wait a while to get your money back .
negative	when checking my e_mails , i had an e_mail with my address it was to be delivered to mum , i explained twice_now , its a present for my mum , okr they said that fine we will change it .
negative	i then received another that they delivering 0 hampers , one to me 0 to mum , again i called , " don_'_t worry i have cancelled 0 to your address .
negative	i explained each time that my partner has not spoken to my parents and i send presents on the side without him knowing , again they told me don_'_t worry your mum will get her hamper monday , ok . it was friday now , so what happened next , yes the next bloody day , i got a hamper , my mum got a hamper and my partner , was like what the hell did you , order a hamper for !
negative	i was left looking stupid , and had to say i was looking and made a mistake , so had to keep it .
negative	i felt forced_into it by littlewoods , keeping it to save face .
negative	i received an e_mail the following_day , hello why don_'_t you buy a hamper we have reduced the price by £_00 what a kick in the teeth .
negative	i have complained but no reply .
negative	so yes its the worst service of my life .
negative	like the last reviewer i have never written an online review of a company before so goes to show how angry i am at the service i have received , i only wish i '_d seen all the bad_reviews before i chose to use them and saved_myself from being completely ripped_off
negative	i have recycled two iphones in the past with a different company and received perfect service , received exactly the same amount i was quoted and received my money quickly .
negative	i chose to use bozowi this time because it offers the highest_amount and claims the same level of service i have received before - do not be_fooled you will not receive this amount for your phone !
negative	my phone was sent off in good condition , followed all of the critieria for a fully working phone iphone_0s in good condition and i was quoted £_000 . 00 - i have received ( although its not actually in my account yet ) £_000 because it was locked to o0 - this was not made clear to me when i entered the contract and i can see from reviews on here that they have only just changed their website this week to say that .
negative	i spoke to a guy in customer_services who also said their terms and conditions had been changed on the website this tuesday 00th_march - my contract was formed on the 00th_february
negative	the thing that has made me even more angry is that i was supposed to receive an_email from them with the revised_offer of £_000 which i never received so i did not have the opportunity to decline their offer and get my phone back .
negative	they claim to have emailed me although my it department have traced all emails and would be notified if anything was blocked for whatever_reason and nothing has tried to come through from them - i received my confirmation_email from them no problem but conveniently this one never arrived in my inbox or even made it to the server .
negative	bozowi customer_services response to this was that it is my responsibilty to make_sure my email is working and i had 0_days to accept or decline to the email i never received so it is my problem .
negative	i agree that my email is my responsibility which is why i had emailed them to tell them i hadn_'_t heard_anything from them and asked what was going on with my account - this email was sent to them within the 0_days they were supposed to wait for me to accept or decline the offer so they basically knew i hadn_'_t received the email but continued to process it anyway ?
negative	one of the three people i spoke to at customer_services confirmed that they had received my email so i know this is not another suposed problem with email
negative	so in summary , i have received a ridiculously_cheap price for my phone nowhere_near the quote i agreed to and through no fault of my own have no option to get my phone back and have to just accept this .
negative	i made them aware i hadn_'_t received any emails from them and they did nothing , a decent company would see my email , re send the offer email and possibly extend the 0 day rule knowing there had been problems .
negative	my phone has now been sent somewhere_else apparently and they can '_t get it back .
negative	don_'_t even get me started on the people they have representing their customer_services - i wasted 0 hour 00_minutes on the phone to them to get nothing resolved , no apology just them implying that i am lying and it '_s not their problem .
negative	at times they spoke with attitude , when i commented that i had been on the phone for 00_minutes the girl replied " no 0 minutes actually " in a rude manner to which i pointed_out she wasn_'_t the first person i had been put through to so infact it was 00_minutes .
negative	i consider myself a very honest person so this whole situation has left me infuriated ans the money hasn_'_t even reached my account !
negative	i ordered two " syringes " of 00_% teeth whitening gel , but i only received one which was 00_% - too strong for my teeth .
negative	i sent them an_email_telling them my order was incorrect and was told i would be sent a replacement pack .
negative	this never arrived ; after emailing again i was told another pack had been sent .
negative	again , nothing arrived .
negative	so two packages supposedly got lost in the post .
negative	i was then asked if i would like a refund , which i gratefully accepted .
negative	i gave them my paypal details but nothing was credited .
negative	to cut an extremely long_story_short , i sent them literally dozens of emails - they kept apologising and assuring_me i would be refunded , but i never was .
negative	eventually , they just ignored my emails .
negative	i took the matter up with paypal , but by then too much time had elapsed to take up a claim .
negative	i have ordered from us companies several_times on - line with no_problems and i believe this company had no_intention of sending me a replacement and they certainly never refunded my money .
negative	if they had refused to co - operate from the beginning , instead of lulling me into a false sense of security by pretending to be helpful , i would have been able to raise a claim with paypal , and i believe they knew_exactly_what they were doing and this was their intention .
negative	the sad thing is if they had acted fairly i would have continued buying from them , so it is their loss .
negative	stay away from this company .
negative	we ordered from bride and groom_direct after a lot of searching for the right wedding_invitations .
negative	it '_s a lovely website with a lot of choice of colours and styles .
negative	we received save the date cards previously which were fabulous , good quality and arrived quickly .
negative	it is now 00 days_later and the wedding_invites have still not arrived .
negative	we emailed to see if they had been despatched , to be told there is a stock problem .
negative	no apology for the delay .
negative	a very blunt message .
negative	i explained that due to the printing on the invites ( the rsvp by date ) that we needed them this week so we can send them to our_guests .
negative	we were told to expect them by the end of the week or a full_refund .
negative	the website states that orders are despatched within 00 days .
negative	this is not the case .
negative	it is false_advertising .
negative	the courtesy of an_email would have been nice to let us know there was a problem .
negative	this is a delay that is disappointing and stressful for us .
negative	we will not order from bride and groom_direct again .
negative	i ordered a bunch flowers from serenata for my mother , next_day delivery as promised .
negative	however , the flowers that came looked nothing like the flowers i ordered .
negative	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco '_s for £ 0 .
negative	i was seriously unhappy with what i received and want my money back as they where not worth the money i spent on them .
negative	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
negative	when i ordered my friends flowers for the 0th of feb i had message from you to say hey had been delivered on the 0th , horrified , will never order again from this company .
negative	it was supposed to be a surprise for her_birthday , ruined it .......
negative	fed_up
negative	a goodwin
negative	we ordered two desktop computers from dell ( order # 00000000 ) which showed a ' shipping ' date of next_day and their pop up delivery message said - ' delivery : products ship on the next business day ( excl .
negative	bank_holidays and weekends ).
negative	delivery method will be the fastest available and generally within 0_days , depending_on customer location .'
negative	so we assumed that we would receive the machines within a week .
negative	we were therefore very surprised when the order acknowledgement arrived to find that their estimated delivery date was 00 days ahead .
negative	the machines were time critical and would arrive too late for us so we phoned dell to enquire why they had misleading delivery times showing on their web_site .
negative	after a lengthy discussion we were left with the impression that we were the only people to have ever questioned_why an advertised delivery time of around a week should magically turn into a minimum of two_weeks .
negative	i find it hard to believe that we were the first to be misled by the promised delivery dates on their web_site .
negative	they offered to look into ' helping_us ' by checking if they could expedite the order but with the clear_indication they could not or would not actually improve it .
negative	i got the impression that the call_centre guy thought i was making a fuss about nothing so had no great expectations !
negative	we have now cancelled the order with dell and have ordered similar machines from dabs who have the items in stock in the uk and who can get them to us on a next_day delivery .
negative	we will never order from dell again .
negative	update 00th_march
negative	it appears that not only do dell show misleading delivery dates on their web_site they are also an administrative shambles .
negative	we cancelled the order using their online form , we know they got the cancellation because someone from dell phoned us to ask if there was anything they could do to persuade us to change our_minds .
negative	yesterday we received an_email to tell us the computers had been shipped to us .
negative	today they took over_£_000 from our bank_account for the cancelled order .
negative	so now we have to refuse the delivery and attempt to get our money back from this incompetent organistion .
negative	update 00th_march
negative	they ignored our request for a refund made using their online form so today i had to phone them .
negative	they have grudgingly conceded that we did indeed cancel the order but here '_s the amazing thing .... instead of doing what any decent company would do and immediately refunding our money because it was their mistake we have to wait for them to get the computers back from their shippers before they will refund us .
negative	even_though it was all their fault we have to wait 0 - 00 days .
negative	update 00th_april
negative	still no refund
negative	lots of emails_telling us this is being expedited for us .
negative	update 00th_may
negative	guess_what - no refund
negative	assurances that the matter is being expedited
negative	we have all begun to wonder_if dell actually understand the word ‘ expedite ’
negative	update 00th_may
negative	still no refund .
negative	no surprise there really is there ?
negative	still receiving the gratuitously stupid emails_telling us this matter is being expedited
negative	update 00th_june
negative	good news at last !
negative	the issue is being ‘ expedited ’ for us .
negative	still no refund though .... boo !
negative	update 0st_july
negative	so many months have now passed by ... spring has moved_into summer
negative	dell periodically email us to tell us they are ‘ expediting ’ this matter .
negative	still ?
negative	really ?
negative	lies !
negative	still no refund ....
negative	seems we have no option but to take legal_action for the recovery of the money stolen from our bank_account by this grossly incompetent organisation .
negative	please do take my advice and never buy anything from this hopeless company – if anything_goes_wrong you will never be able to resolve it with them .
negative	this is the second time i have ordered from this company and my experience this time was worse_than the last .
negative	the first item took over a week to dispatch and my second order , placed 00 days ago , has not even been dispatched yet .
negative	as a result i would like to cancel my order and have notified the company of this .
negative	i am greatly disappointed , especially after_reading all the great reviews on this website .
negative	will definitely not be using them again .
negative	i hate o0 , the customer service team are awful are completely incapable of ever following an instructing or assisting in any matter .
negative	you continue to be diverted to another area e . g .
negative	to contract cancellation team , or the pay monthly , but no one ever seems to be able to help with a situation .
negative	i have spent_hundreds on my phone contract .
negative	one month i spent over_£_000 . 00 as i was away in south_america .
negative	i also had my phone line , my broadband and ipad linked to o0 , and yet they still seem not to value me as a customer , or to execute any basic task i ask them to e . g . help with a broken phone .
negative	i '_ve been with them since i had my first ever phone .
negative	i hate the fact i am contracted to o0 and am unable to leave without a huge fine .
negative	as soon as i am able to get out i will .
negative	i ordered a dress more than a month before a wedding i was in and called regularly to check on the status .
negative	they said it should be in a few_days before the wedding and they would overnight it to me free of charge .
negative	they never overnighted it , they priority mailed it which it ended_up showing up the day before the wedding so i had no time to make alterations at all .
negative	i just wish they would have done what they said they were going to do instead of lying to me !
negative	they stated they never received my returns - however , i do not believe they never received it .
negative	like the previous lady_who was lied to regarding early settlement , myself and my partner were lied to by stoneacre in hull .
negative	i specifically_asked the question " what are the early repayment penalties " and was told " 00 days interest ."
negative	however , the very small_print on our agreement states that charges can be anything between £_000 and £_000 charge for every £ 0000 owed .
negative	therefore , making early settlement impractical and very expensive .
negative	we were also told that interest on the loan they could give us was spread evenly throughout the loan term .
negative	however , after_speaking to the finance company , barclay '_s , we now know that this was also a lie .
negative	we have complained in writing and in person to stoneacre hull who so far have told us that we can not get out of the agreement .
negative	we are now awaiting responses in writing from both stoneacre and barclay '_s and intend to pursue our complaint further with the financial_ombudsman .
negative	in the meantime , i would strongly_urge_anyone considering buying a car from stoneacre to either sort_out their finances first or take a team of lawyers with you to scrutinise all the smallprint on any agreement before signing .
negative	also beware of the diversionary tactics they used with us to take our attention away from the forms .
negative	e . g .
negative	they handed us a customer survey while my partner was looking at the finance_agreement to divert our attentiion .
negative	needless to say the staff we saw at stoneacre in hull have lied to us and we will never use the company again .
negative	expensive , disgracefully disorganised parking , horrible expensive messy food , tatty displays of lego buildings which were originally nice but now not properly maintained , too few staff , long_queues .
negative	we and the kids had a really bad day out here - luckily i wasn_'_t paying but a relative was and we all felt upset she had wasted her money , even the kids .
negative	wrote to legoland customer_services but just got a bland response which did not address the issues i raised .
negative	i '_m amazed_at how many people they get in this park , so it must make financial sense to them to operate like this .
negative	so don_'_t expect it to change if you complain , and i doubt it will get better .
negative	still , if you want a decent day out go somewhere_else and spend the money on something_else .
negative	i placed an order on saturday for 0xbasin taps !
negative	being a typical female i did not , at the time , realise that basin and bath_taps are different !
negative	not wishing the wrong taps being sent , i immediately called these people on the first working day after the order , ie yesterday mon 0 dec .
negative	these people are impossible to reach on the phone , and calling an 0000 number from a mobile and holding on for 00 - 00 minute stretches at a time costs a fortune !
negative	i eventually gave up on the after sales_team and decided to speak to the sales_team who miraculously answered the phone immediately !
negative	funny that !!
negative	!
negative	when the guy_who answered realised i had a query and was not placing an order he curtly told me he could not help and that he would put me on hold and i should dial 0 or 0 and speak to someone !
negative	but nobody answers just a message_saying all they are experiencing unusual high call volumns ( hardly surprisiing since this company seems to want to take money but provide nothing else )!!!
negative	so i sent a message via their contact form on the website not realising i would have to wait 00_hours for a reply !
negative	i did eventually speak to someone , explained my problem and they could not or would not swap the order and take the additional small_fee , so i asked them to cancel the order to which the woman i spoke to said she would do so .
negative	not really trusting her less_than enthusiastic assistance , i asked for confirmation in writing !
negative	around 0 : 00 yesterday evening when i had not seen a cancellation confirmation i emailed them , to which no reply !
negative	no surprise there then - another example of this companies substandard attitude_towards customer_care !!
negative	!
negative	imagine my surprise when , low and behold , i did receive an_email from them , but only to happily inform_me that the taps i had asked them to cancel has_been despatched !!!
negative	to say that i am fuming is putting it mildly !!
negative	!
negative	if i had a positive , whether you want a product or not , it does at_least turn_up fast !!!
negative	the damn taps arrived at 0 :_00am this morning , and i have handed them straight back to the driver to be returned to this trueshopping !!
negative	!
negative	i now envisage a fight getting a prompt refund !!!
negative	if i have not received a full_refund by close of business friday 00th_december , then i reserve the right to take this matter to trading_standards , which or even watchdog !
negative	if they can debit my account with speed and efficiency , then they can credit the money back with the same speed and effciency !!!
negative	!
negative	yes i made a genuine error in assuming basin and bath_taps are one and the same , but this companies entire attitude and lack of due dilligence and care is appalling !
negative	honestly , i have never come_across any organization who has such a total disregard towards its customers !!!
negative	funny though how their sales_department phone line is never busy !!!
negative	!
negative	nutshell - avoid this company !
negative	----
negative	postscript : i have just taken the time to read through the various complaints concerning this company , in the main its lack of customer service , i have gone quite a way back ... time and again the replies that all these people who have left a review have received from trueshopping is the same it is clearly a bog_standard copy / paste type of reply : and it reads :
negative	" i sincerely apologise for the lack of response from our customer service team .
negative	i can_assure you that this is not usual practice for us and is purely due to a high_volume of emails and calls being received at present .
negative	we are working on rectifying this ."
negative	how long does it take to " rectify " the lack of response from the customer service team !!
negative	clearly from what i can see their lack of customer service , lack of answering phones , answering emails is their usual practice !!!
negative	!
negative	i placed an order on 00 / 00 / 00 of a cotton candy 00cm plastic dog bed as it seemed a bargain , and my dog desperately needs a new bed .
negative	ordered via priority post .
negative	today is now wednesday and still no bed has arrived so i call seapets only to be told it had not even been dispatched yet !
negative	the sales_person_who i spoke to was very abrupt when i requested my order cancelled so i could find somewhere that is quicker with their shipping .
negative	first and last order placed with this company and would definately not use again . will stick with amazon in future and pay the same price to get it delivered next_day !
negative	i paid for a christian_dior watch on 00nd_november_0000 for a birthday_present .
negative	as i hadn_'_t heard_anything by 00th_december i contacted darren reay and was informed he had a throat infection .
negative	the next excuse was a massive snowfall on the east_coast of usa , then his supplier was in hospital , followed_by the only watch available had a diamond missing .
negative	the final excuse on 00st_january_0000 of darren losing his voice meant i asked for my money back to be told i should contact my card_issuer and get them to do a chargeback .
negative	fish always looks stale and probably causes the unpleasant smell in the store .
negative	the variety of goods stocked is frequently cut with the result that it is fortunate if half the items on my list are available .
negative	worth driving to waitrose in thame to shop .
negative	took my phone into the branch for repair , two_weeks_later not heard_anything - asst manager told me it was still in for repair .
negative	week_later i went back , another staff_member admitted the phone was left out the back and only sent off a day ago .
negative	manager refused to see me and was told nothing the branch could do .
negative	complained through main website and received response stating it was an internal matter and they don_'_t have to let_me know what_happens .
negative	they take your money , they make_mistakes , they have no morals or sense of customer service and they would lie to get away with it .
negative	dont shop at the carphonewarehouse !
negative	my initial delight at being_able to find and obtain an_alternative bath from victoria_plumb at very short_notice quickly turned to dismay on learning that the waste outlet they had recommended didn_'_t fit standard bsi pipes .
negative	my plumber rang vp to explain that the bathroom installation was on hold until this issue could be resolved .
negative	while customer_services couldn_'_t transfer him to the technical_team for advice on how to resolve matters , they did email a red ( urgent ) referral ), indicating a 0 - hour responss time .
negative	my plumber made a number of follow - up calls to chase a response , to no_avail .
negative	i made 0 separate attempts and each time was stone - walled by your call_centre reps .
negative	i found their explanation that they couldn_'_t liaise with this team over the phone absolutely incredulous , in the same way that it was not possible to excalate the complaint to a senior_member of staff .
negative	i was simply told we '_d have to wait our turn in the ' queue ' and that there were obviously a high number of referrals that have been passed over that day .
negative	00_hours_later - we have heard_nothing !
negative	i posted a review on the item to alert other customers to a potential problem - a day later it is still not showing , which has turned my dismay to distrust and disgust .
negative	thankfully , my resourceful plumber has found an_alternative solution to the problem , to enable the work to proceed .
negative	no thanks to victoria_plumb .
negative	i will definitely not be using you again .
negative	placed an order for a quad_bike before christmas and was informed that it would probably arrive on the 00nd or 00rd_dec but if not , definitely on the 00th .
negative	we ' re still_waiting !
negative	according to my online a /_c it was dispatched on the 00th_jan despite me cancelling the order on the 00th .
negative	it never arrived .
negative	i have phoned every day since the 00nd_dec only to be told they are closed , have emailed and left messages on the website .
negative	nobody has contacted me at all .
negative	for an order of nearly_£_000 you would think they '_d make an effort .
negative	i disputed the payment with my credit_card company who have now refunded my account .
negative	definitely not recommending this company !!
negative	!
negative	arena flowers not only failed to deliver the flowers on time , but also pretend that nothing happened and try to deliver on the next_day thinking that we will be ok with it .
negative	but i am not ok with it this time and i am totally upset and angry because i am supposed to receive flowers on valentine '_s day , not on the day after valentine '_s day !!!!
negative	they just don_'_t understand that " special_occasion " is on " a specific date "!
negative	when i talked to the driver he admitted that it was his fault since he didn_'_t call me when he can '_t enter the main door for my apartment and he just left .
negative	however , when we complaint about this issue to the company , they lied , found all_sorts of excuses , and even tried to blame their fault on us .
negative	their service is the worst i have ever had , and their customer service is extremely rude .
negative	please_avoid using arena flowers delivery at all costs .
negative	order was delivered 0_days late .
negative	i called up the day after the order was supposed to arrive to find out that the company had run_out of stock of 0 of the items i had ordered .
negative	i questioned_why no effort had been made to contact me - i was told they were getting round to it ( group e_- mail ?).
negative	the order was now due for 0_days time ( considering i had ordered at 0 , 00 ) - but regardless it didn_'_t arrive until another 0_days after that - with the product that had run_out of stock .
negative	this was of course good , except that what i think it meant is that when i asked them to remove the product that was causing the late delivery thus delivering my order sooner , it was forgotten / ignored / idioted .
negative	same as the last reviewer .
negative	sent flowers for my mum on mothers_day .
negative	flowers were dumped in a box on the doorstep .
negative	opened the box and all the peaches roses had started turning_brown and we ' re clearly not fresh .
negative	arena would not replace even after i sent them photos - said they were " guard petals " and they should be pulled off to reveal the rose .
negative	unfortunately that would have just left her with a collection of stems … making idiots out of their customers .
negative	i placed my order with this company for a number of items all of which arrived within a week - fine so far .
negative	unfortunately the tap was damaged .
negative	i informed tapsuk immediately and sent a photo as requested .
negative	a replacement tap was ordered on 00 / 00 / 00 but despite_numerous_emails , which were responded to at first , i still have not received a replacement and today is 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the last email i had from them was on 00 / 00 / 00 saying the tap would be in their warehouse on 00 / 00 / 00 and would be shipped to me within 00_hours , and have heard_nothing from them since .
negative	i have been without a tap and sink in my new_kitchen for a week now , i am still washing up in a little bowl !!
negative	- this has put a dampener on my excitement for my new_kitchen as i cannot get it finished and fully_functioning , everything else is lovely .
negative	have tried_ringing and you go round in circles , you cannot get to speak to a person !!
negative	the customer service is abysmal - avoid at all costs .
negative	you were warned .
negative	would recomend this company for quality of products will use them again
negative	i ordered a mixed pack of products of exante , which was sent out very promptly !
negative	unfortunately when i opened the pack half the bars that were supposed to be in the pack had been replaced with more of the 0 varieties that were sent .
negative	ie .
negative	i only received 0 types of bars instead of 0 .
negative	things went_downhill from there on in , taking over two_weeks till i received the correct order !
negative	during this time there was a lack of response to my emails , a claim they had not received the incorrect bars back when the tracking on collect_plus showed the exact date and time they had received them , and no apology for the massive upheaval caused to me for their error !
negative	fantastic product , very tasty and lots of variety , but please get your customer service up to scratch !!!
negative	ps .
negative	i am fed_up with companies only having an 0000 number to phone which can cost a fortune if you only have a mobile phone to use !
negative	i received notice by email that on wed_00th that my purchase had been sent to me that day .
negative	on monday 00th i called customer service to ask why it had not been delivered .
negative	a young_woman wivoice incomprehensible voice told me that it was at the droitwich depot .
negative	i think that '_s what she said !!!
negative	i asked her numerous_times to slow down and speak clearly but she seemed incapable of doing so .
negative	later in the day , the delivery was made so the information i was given was incorrect anyway .
negative	i '_m writing this an_hour after asking her to contact the depot and let_me know where the parcel is but she hasn_'_t called back .
negative	i couldn_'_t_believe_how annoying this apple stuff is !
negative	my phone didn_'_t have the that button and says " well it wouldn_'_t work without that button !"
negative	i says that '_s impossible as my phones been fine but now i can '_t get onto wifi .
negative	i could never get into 0g either !
negative	i never complained and just thought that it was due to the location i was in .
negative	now i can '_t even go on wifi and decided to take it out on the wifi company .
negative	they asked if my other phones did this and i said " no ".
negative	they explained that we have very quick broadband and it wasn_'_t their problem .
negative	i decided to ask apple_store itself .
negative	they found that apple hasn_'_t even activated the 0g network and told me to call o0 .
negative	but after that phone_call - their customer service is awful !
negative	they gave_me such a talk about a settings that wasn_'_t even there !
negative	it was definitely their fault - i mean i bought it from them .
negative	they then went on and on .
negative	my mother then explained again and again and still gave her the same answer .
negative	they sounded awful and told me to bring it to a store .
negative	just hearing her again gives me a headache !
negative	awful customer service .
negative	i '_ve just found out that i '_ve been paying £_00 a month and not getting my 0g - awful .
negative	switch to t - mobile !
negative	my sister '_s phone is t - mobile and it is amazing !
negative	every time city_link has ever tried to deliver anything to us , it '_s been a disaster ( based on 0 - 0 unique deliveries ).
negative	they always make the first_attempt , always fail because we never seem to be home when they come by , and then the disaster starts .
negative	rescheduling is a nightmare !
negative	you select a date on the web , but the driver tries again anyway on the wrong day and then they either a ) hold your goods , b ) return them to sender , or c ) no show on the redelivery date forcing another phone_call .
negative	we tried to avoid this by paying extra to deliver to our local post_office .
negative	we got a confirmation_email , pitched up at the post_office on the arranged day , and our stuff wasn_'_t there !
negative	we then had to call them again and they said it was too_big to deliver to the post_office .
negative	they couldn_'_t call us ?
negative	they mandate a contact method when you reschedule , so not having our info is no excuse .
negative	we now no_longer order from merchants who use city_link .
negative	just received my refund order placed 0 / 0 / 00 order refunded 00 / 0 / 00 customer service team move the goal_posts on a daily_basis to accommodate there unacceptable service .
negative	this company may be cheaper_than the high_street but more chance of wining the lottery that receiveing proper timely help when delivery you pay for is not received nor refunded .
negative	£_00 . 00 is a lot to pay for delivery still_waiting after almost 0_months on an explanation as to why we are not being refunded for pallet delivery when our bathroom_suite arrived loose in the back of a transit with several items damaged and broken waiting almost 0_months for refund of damaged items but no refund for pallet delivery we did not receive .
negative	trading_standards are aware of this company and investigating the laws they are breaking also looking into them charging customers surcharges for paying with paypal .
negative	avoid as you have no guarantee of receiving your goods damage free and have no chance of resolving in a timely_manner be warned an extremely stressful experience that has put me off online shopping .
negative	anyone that is considering taking up the higher offer from bozowi should most definitely read all reviews first , i didn_'_t and it caused me more stressed than actually needed .
negative	i sent my perfectly working iphone_0s 00gb in white , lock to o0 to bozowi .
negative	first of all i was given a quote of £_000 .
negative	all was well till i received an_email_stating “ the engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a scratches on the unit and on camera lens and phone is network locked to o0 ”
negative	there was no mention in the quote initially received about deducting money for the phone being locked , there is even the option to add who the phone is locked to .
negative	i also knew there was a tiny_scratch on the camera but nothing considerable , i have taken many great photos without this affecting it .
negative	i was furious with the second quote they had offered of £_000 .
negative	the company then went on to say if i unlocked the phone ( at a cost ) they would up the quote by £_00 .
negative	i was not happy .
negative	the company is here to rip people off so they can make more money on the phone themselves .
negative	they charge you £_00 to return your phone , which i ended_up paying .
negative	i received my phone back on wed00th april .
negative	i have since sent it to mazuma on thurs_00th apr and they have paid the £_000 quote straight_away and has cleared my bank today , fri_00th_april
negative	avoid bozowi at all costs , otherwise it will cost you !!!
negative	!
negative	stick with mazuma_mobile , guaranteed happiness and helpful - ness everytime !
negative	!
negative	i thought your site said flowers from local_florist .
negative	they were delivered by post late and now my sister has to collect them from sorting_office by which time they could be dead .
negative	will never use this site again
negative	the difference_between rentalcars price and budget '_s price ( hiring direct ) was £_00 .
negative	this is excessive , and i shall not be using rentalcar again .
negative	you '_d probably wish you hadn_'_t asked ...
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend xln , despite my long previous history , i don_'_t know_whats changed with them of late but they are now appauling !
negative	i was recommended to switch tariffs to save money .. and then was charged_£_000 for the set_up of it - their error they said , but they took the funds out of my account without my knowledge anyway , then to get it back was a nightmare !!!
negative	basically xln refusing and just saying they would give me credit eventually ... so in the end the bank cancelled the payment after some time of waiting from me .
negative	xln then hammered me with lots of charges saying i hadn_'_t paid my bill as the bank has to cancel the whole payment .
negative	i then cancelled my direct_debit as i cant trust how much they will take , so they now charge me more each_month as i will only pay manually - i had asked for my bill to be re issued without this set_up fee and they kept getting in incorrect .
negative	oh , and as they have changed me to a super_duper money saving tariff ( pfftt ) i '_m now , stuck with them !
negative	so ... sales , service , customer service ... terrible .... but on the plus_side , if i had to pick anything , if ive_ever had a technical_issue with broadband for example , that specific team have been fine .
negative	i was with xln telecom for a number of years when they rang me with a fixed price contract of around £_00 .
negative	i noticed that i was then paying more than before , so when i complained they brought it down to £_00 .
negative	i was then offered a new deal by a small local company for the same service for only £_00 so i gave notice to xln as required .
negative	i had checked this with them and knew that no fee was due .
negative	i gave almost 0_months notice .
negative	despite this , i was constantly bombarded with invoices for a termination fee of £_000 , even_though they knew perfectly well that this was not due .
negative	i got these invoices by email , sometimes several in one day , and also by post .
negative	i contacted them and asked to them to stop sending invoices but they continued .
negative	even after_speaking on the phone to one of their employees who confirmed that no fee was due , the invoices continued on and on and on .
negative	i informed them that if they did not stop sending these invoices , i would cancel my direct_debit as i feared that they would illegally remove £_000 from my account .
negative	once again , no reply .
negative	i cancelled the direct_debit and informed them that i had done so and asked them to send the final invoice and i would pay by cheque .
negative	no reply .
negative	the never - ending invoices continued to arrive .
negative	the final invoice was for £ 0 of calls including_vat and an invented charge for “ unpaid direct_debit ”.
negative	they also overcharged me for monthly_fees as i was only with them for two_thirds of the final month but they charged for the whole month .
negative	i wrote to them on 00 . 00 . 00 explaining all this .
negative	once again , no reply .
negative	now they have written demanding the £_00 they say i owe them , threatening me with debt_collectors and damaging my credit_rating .
negative	it would probably cost more to fight this than to just pay , so i am going to pay .
negative	hopefully karma will get them in the end .
negative	i rang up 0_days after i '_d ordered some items for holiday and i was going on holiday the following_day to be told that they were out for delivery that day .
negative	i thought great .. just in time .
negative	they weren_'_t even delivered after being told that they were on their way .
negative	i got back from holiday thinking they were going to be at my house but they weren_'_t .
negative	i rang up and all they had to say was that ' they must have got lost ' awesome customer service !
negative	!
negative	do not use this company .. you pay for the goods get the voucher then nothing arrives .. well and truly conned
negative	the site says they will deliver same day , but had a call at 0pm saying unable to .
negative	flowers 0_days late - will they turn_up ?
negative	doubt it now .
negative	claim that their delivery policy is made clear on ordering - it isn_'_t !!
negative	don_'_t use this company .
negative	so disappointed for my friend .
negative	lebara does not give complete info never .
negative	does not ease customers to get the best tariffs for them .
negative	i am going to another company as long as i have no more credit , because lebara dos not give back any extra money put in your phone by mistake .
negative	my case is just to cry .
negative	horrible technical_support , coverage impossible where i live now , no internet_connection but data was being comsumed somehow .
negative	never ever .
negative	is it going to be for something all this ???
negative	so many_times i claimed nothing happend because lebara only wants money , not giving a service back to the customer .
negative	a pity but true .
negative	i first used logodesignguarantee . co . uk in april_0000 for my partners window cleaning company and was pleased with the simple yet personal design i received , so when my mother in - law asked me about a logo for her business i was happy to recommend them and placed the order with all details of what she wanted and attached pictures .
negative	i placed the order 00th_november_0000 but after a week i had not had any contact from them at all so sent them an_email , i did not receive any designs until 0_weeks_later ( even_though promised a response in 00 - 00_hrs ) which was via_email and not in my personal account , the designs were ok but no where close to what i had requested and i did not see that as a major_issue because of their " unlimited revisions request ".
negative	i sent another email_detailing all revisions and over a week_later i got just 0 logo sample which was laughable , again none of the designs were in my account to view only via_email so once again i replied with my requests !!
negative	!.
negative	i was sent exactly the same logo sample again and that was the start of over 00 emails being exchanged with either the same design or the same responses :
negative	" the support that you need shall be extended to you shortly "
negative	" we have received the revisions that you want , and our designers are starting their work on your project "
negative	" we apologize for the delay of the design samples .
negative	our senior design expert is still working on the project so as to satisfy your concept of the logo "
negative	" please provide more details and we will get back to you within 00 - 00_hours ".
negative	i have even received my partners window cleaning logo as one of my samples !!
negative	!.
negative	i have tried to get a refund but that has_been ignored even_though they boast of a 000_% satisfaction_guarantee .
negative	*** if you are cautious enough to do your homework first then i would avoid like the plague ***
negative	if you paid with your debit or credit_card as a guest through paypal then the simplest solution is to contact your bank who might be able to refund you by issuing a card payment reversal under the consumer credit act , the transaction on your statement shows as " nochex " just keep any emails to them asking for a refund as proof .
negative	if you paid via_paypal you have 00 days from purchase to file a dispute but don_'_t delay for " weeks ".
negative	if , after a short time chasing , the reply is unsatisfactory or absent , make a claim .
negative	i joined utility_warehouse in march last_year and have encountered nothing but problems .
negative	the switch over was nothing but a headache with one problem after another .
negative	recently i have had problems paying my bill due to taking 00 weeks off work to care for my mother who had terminal lung cancer and was given a max of 00 weeks to live & on top of that my partner was waiting for an operation on his wrist so was in plaster_cast and unable to work , i called to explain the situation on at_least 0 occasions and i was told my account would be protected , the payment was 0_weeks late but my services were disconnected despite_being advised they would nt be , i was left with no broadband & internet for over a week and told i would be charged to have them reconnected .
negative	( our bills have always been paid up until then ) my recent bill was a lot more then expected so i called once again to explain that due to the circumstances it would be a little late , my bill was due on the 0st of december and i paid half of it asking for a week or so to settle the rest of the bill and 0_days_later all my services have been once again cut_off with out warning !
negative	!.
negative	all the way through i have been in contact with utility_warehouse and expected a little_bit of understanding and am shocked they would cut_off my service for a bill 0_days late even_though communication was made .
negative	i called customer service to pay my bill and ask why after being told my services would be protected was i cut_off and the person i spoke to was rude , kept speaking over me and told me " you cant just call up and pay your bill whenever you feel like it and i should of given them a date when the bill would be settled but i was never asked to provide a date from the previous call .
negative	the customer_services has mostly been terrible and i am quite upset i was spoken to like that for a bill that is only 0_days late !!
negative	!.
negative	dealing_with them now is just an extra worry i never expected to have and dread the thought of having to stay them !!
negative	i would rather pay more money then go through all this hassle !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered the flowers on the 0th_august to be delivered on the 00th and they '_ve never been received .
negative	i received a text on 00th at 0000hrs stating the recipient was in possession of the flowers and they weren_'_t .
negative	the recipient has cctv and confirms that they have never had any sort of attempted delivery .
negative	still_waiting for my flowers or a refund .
negative	would not recommend this company to anyone is it '_s totally_ruined the surprise of the gift .
negative	serenata claim they are chasing this up with the courier .
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	i tried to place an order on line several_times and it wouldn_'_t go through the website .
negative	eventually someone contacted me to place the order .
negative	i had originally requested if i wasn_'_t available to leave with neighbours .
negative	when the order arrived i had gone out for 0 hour and was left a note telling_me i '_d missed them and to rearrange another time .
negative	i had been in all day other than this one hour .
negative	i was told i had an_email_telling_me the times .
negative	why couldn_'_t someone text or phone instead of sending an_email 0 hours before they were due to arrive ?
negative	0_days_later was the earliest delivery .
negative	when i received my order i discovered i was missing some items and one of the items had arrived damaged .
negative	i couldn_'_t get_hold of anyone via telephone for 0_days and the lady i eventually spoke to said she would send my items and a replacement for the damaged item within 00_hours .
negative	i still hadn_'_t received them after 00_hours .
negative	i tried to contact the company being on hold for 00_minutes at a time and constantly getting cut_off by an_automated_system telling_me my call would be answered within 0 minute .
negative	0_days_later i managed to speak to someone via the online_chat who told me my order was still being_processed and would be another 0_days !!
negative	what ?!!!
negative	i '_ve already waited 0_weeks !!!!!
negative	i told them to forget it and refund me providing i wouldn_'_t be waiting another 0_weeks for the refund .
negative	they told me it would be 0 - 0_days and they had already processed the refund .
negative	it is now 0_weeks_later and i still_haven_'_t received a refund .
negative	i am_disgusted with the service and incompetence of this company which is obviously run by complete and utter imbeciles !
negative	so you place your order for a small jacket , do you get an_email_saying you '_ve placed an order , no !
negative	they then send a medium jacket , when you contact the numpties to do a straight swap over do they assist you with this no !
negative	so you then traipse to the collect_+ point to return their mistake , do you get an_email_saying they '_ve received it , no !
negative	do you then get the replacement you requested that was in stock when you initially contacted the numpties in the customer_care team , no !
negative	do you at anytime receive any form of communications from superdry , no !
negative	so do superdry deserve your custom no , no , no !
negative	i dislike the way this company has hidden_charges .
negative	ryanair is an airline i do not like travelling with & only use them as a last_resort .
negative	i purchased a clock cabin in 0000 from dunster house .
negative	their installation was shoddy to say the least and they had to return a year later as the roof was leaking , screws were protruding through the ceiling and the braces were incorrectly fitted .
negative	they put a new roof on but a year later water was pouring in again through the roof .
negative	they refused to even come and inspect it without me paying them !
negative	i arranged an_independent expert inspection to find that the roof was unfit for purpose .
negative	they put shingles on a roof that is virtually flat .
negative	the water doesn_'_t run off and it pools and finds its way under the shingles and through the membrane which is full of holes made by the nails used to fix the shingles !!
negative	they refused to do anything about it so i took it up with the credit_card companies .
negative	i have just received a full_refund including installation fee .
negative	their product is unfit for purpose , of unsatisfactory quality and they have misled me .
negative	they are still selling this cabin with the option of shingles .
negative	beware .
negative	p . s i am sure they will respond with their usual excuses as they did with me for 0_months .
negative	however , had i not had a case , the credit_card companies would not have refunded me in full .
negative	i chose to sell a pair of ghd_hair_straighteners for £_00 . 00 back in november and have still not received the money .
negative	it may not seem a massive amount but to me as a skint student it is a lot .
negative	chose to have my item collected by one a courier .
negative	the courier did not come on the date i selected .
negative	i emailed music_magpie informing them of this , and received an_automated_response telling_me i would receive a proper reply within 0_days .
negative	i received this reply 0_days_later , and it stated that the matter would be looked in to .
negative	that was the last i heard about that .
negative	the courier had already arrived by this time , coming one day late , luckily he came during the one hour that day which i was at home , so i was able to give him my item .
negative	ten days_later i received an_email from music_magpie stating that my item had not been received my them , and asking if i had decided not to sell .
negative	i sent them a message the day after i received this email , using the online contact form on their website , in which stated that a courier had been to collect my item on 0rd_december and that i had a receipt from him proving this , and asking what i should do .
negative	again , i received an_automated_response saying i would be replied to within 00_hours .
negative	i never received a reply , so i sent another message using this form - again my message went ignored .
negative	then , on 00th_december , i received another email from music_magpie saying ' we have not received your items , have you decided not to sell ?'
negative	obviously this was very annoying as i had already sent two messages stating that my item had been collected by their courier some time ago .
negative	these messages had obviously not even been read .
negative	so , on the same day ( 00th_december ) i found an_email address for customer_services on the music_magpie website .
negative	i sent an_email to this address explaining everything that had happened and expressing my disappointment in the lack of responses to my messages .
negative	i received a response to this email 0_days_later on 0nd_january ( probably because i titled the message are you ever going to reply to my messages )... informing_me that my item had not been received by them and asking for some more details ( order number , number of items in the box , how many boxes it was packaged in and a tracking_reference ) so that they could make a claim from ' my hermes ,' the courier service they use , for the loss of my hair_straighteners .
negative	i responses immediately with all this information .
negative	i received no response to this .
negative	on 00th_january , i sent yet another email , with the subject line as hello is anybody there ?
negative	again explaining everything that had happened and asking whether or not i would be receiving my money .
negative	again , i received no response .
negative	on tuesday of last_week ( 00th_january ) my father telephoned music_magpie on my behalf to try and finally get some response .
negative	he was told that i would receive an_email the next_day asking me to confirm my bank details so that the money could be transferred to me .
negative	i did not receive this email .
negative	he telephoned again on thursday 00th_january to ask again , and the man on the phone contacted his supervisor to obtain authority to transfer the money to my bank .
negative	he was authorised to do this and said that the money would be transferred on friday 00th .
negative	i still have not received an_email asking for my bank details , and the money has not been transferred .
negative	i have emailed them again to ask whether they would like my bank details to transfer the money , but , not surprisingly , i have received no reply .
negative	absolutely_shocking service and i will not be using them again .
negative	would not recommend this company at all , i am so disappointed and have never felt so undervalued as a customer - absolute_joke .
negative	item never delivered , had to contact customer service at_least 0 times to follow_up , could never get through to customer service , always had to leave a message and they would call back 0_days_later .
negative	refused to refund me till items were returned to them via their courier ( even_though i never actually recieved them !!!!!)
negative	rude , unhelpful and possibly the worst experience i have ever had with an online company .
negative	will never ever use or recommend them again .
negative	my son bought my husband and i a two night hotel break for christmas .
negative	great we thought .
negative	wrong - nearly all the hotels stipulate that your stay must be between sunday - thursday and between october and april .
negative	we both work and a weekend away would have been great as my son thought .
negative	unfortunately he didn_'_t know this until be bought the gift .
negative	i have tried to change for something_else but whatever you decide on you cannot determine if there are certain times you cannot use the gift .
negative	i even looked up theatre trips but there are only a few shows and not really anything that is any good .
negative	its a nice idea but in practice the money towards a hotel stay or a voucher from a chosen hotel is by far a better option .
negative	three customer_services are liars , thieves , rood , don_'_t understand a word of english & give u an impression that your an_idiot to embarrass u so u can shut up .
negative	they have been taking out money from my bank_account for the last 0_months after begging them to cancel my direct_debit because i had a new contract & didn_'_t want the old service , i also tolled them i didn_'_t need it because i had wi_-_fi , i was tolled that i cant use my ipad '_s wi_-_fi with out a sim_card & turned_out to be a lie .
negative	not mentioning the very bad coverage
negative	although the phone had arrived at mazuma offices my account till said expired , i emailed the company and they stated my phone had ' been lost in the post '.
negative	the phone was a decent working phone and people are lieing about it not being recieved .
negative	will_definately never use again !
negative	my partner and i booked a hotel in glasgow city_centre in october so we could attend the commonwealth games to which we have been allocated tickets .
negative	we knew how busy and expensive it was going to get so thought we would be sensible and book immediately .
negative	now , 0_months later , you have informed us that you will not be honouring our booking , effectively cancelling our booking , with only 0_months to go and as prices for accommodation increase daily .
negative	our booking was confirmed .
negative	we have called the hotel and they have told us they received our booking and you cancelled our reservation , so please stop blaming a ‘ technical_error ’.
negative	you are punishing our foresight just so you can line your pockets with the substantially increased cost of a hotel room .
negative	nothing in your terms and conditions allows for this situation .
negative	your offer of a refund is unacceptable as we would then be unable to see the commonwealth games .
negative	we will be out of pocket booking another hotel room which are now nearly triple the cost of our original booking .
negative	the alternative_accommodation offers in edinburgh and ayr are a joke .
negative	i have already planned 0_days in edinburgh as part of my holiday , and have no desire at this time to visit ayr - i have planned a holiday to glasgow .
negative	we have booked our return flight out of glasgow ; do you expect us to drag our_luggage around with us all day on the day of our flight back to london ?
negative	your offer of providing train_tickets is ridiculous .
negative	the last train from glasgow to ayr leaves at 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
negative	the last train from glasgow to edinburgh leaves at 00 . 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
negative	how are we supposed to experience glaswegian nightlife if we have to catch a train back before 00 . 00pm ?
negative	our night at the games doesn ’_t finish until 00pm ; it will be a real_pleasure rushing out of the stadium and back to the train_station .
negative	we spend 0_days a week commuting on central_london underground trains , why do you think i want to go on holiday and spend nearly 0 hours commuting 00 miles ?
negative	this is further to the fact that the alternate hotel in ayr is 0 . 0km from the train_station .
negative	how exciting to arrive back in ayr at midnight to wait for a taxi !
negative	i have a longstanding issue with a broken foot , which was one of the reasons we booked a centrally_located glasgow hotel , and you see fit to offer alternatives not within the same city ?
negative	catching trains is not possible and frankly insulting .
negative	how about offering another one of your customers enjoying a holiday in london alternative_accommodation in birmingham and see how they respond .
negative	you need to arrange alternative_accommodation in glasgow city_centre .
negative	looking online there is plenty of accommodation in glasgow city_centre .
negative	if you cannot find us a hotel in glasgow , i expect you to refund not only the hotel booking you cannot ‘ honour ’(£ 000 ), but also the cost of other hotels we have already paid for during our holiday (£_000 ), our tickets to the commonwealth games (£_000 ) and the cost of our return flights to london (£_000 ).
negative	your customer service has_been appalling .
negative	how_dare you not reply to any of our calls and voicemails .
negative	how_dare you delay your response to emails , and then expect a prompt reply to your ‘ offer of refund ’ within 00_hours .
negative	i am not going to disappear because you continue to ignore me .
negative	this is your responsibility - stop trying to pass the blame .
negative	i '_ve_used this meet and greet 0 times , first occasion was ok , second time my car was returned covered in mud with muddy_footprints on the inside of the back door and footwell .
negative	i thought this was a one off as it was bad_weather at the time and as the 0st time was ok i stupidly booked again .
negative	repeat performance of the mud , all wheels caked in it , splattered all over the sides of the car and ground into the car mat .
negative	i guess they park in a muddy field - disgusting service and they have not even had the decency to acknowledge or reply to a complaint .
negative	i paid more for flowers to be delivered the same day ... and there was less choice ... only to be emailed that evening and told they hadn_'_t been delivered .
negative	have emailed back twice with no answer .
negative	won_'_t be using them again ... sorry .... but rubbish service !!
negative	don_'_t call them ' same day ' flowers if they aren_'_t .
negative	ordered item on the 00 / 0 item was shipped 00 / 0 and yet still has not arrived 0 / 0 / 00 and i have now been asked what i think of the service i have had .....
negative	we have been fooled in to another 00 months contract with talktalk , they are constantly trying to rip us off and take more money what was agreed , stuck with them now but not after 00 months
negative	as above as the flowers were not received and i am not satisfied with you service a full_refund is wanted
negative	i have just attempted to book a flight with you from phuket to ho_chi minh on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	i was told that in the time from selecting the flight to confirming payment the product was no_longer available .
negative	luckily for me however , you have still been able to charge me while providing me with nothing .
negative	kindly , you have told be call you at my expense !
negative	just wondering what you are planning to do about this as i have no_intention of ringing you to sort this out !
negative	reading_reviews of others with the same experience , so hopefully you '_ll be experts at sorting this out promptly !?
negative	looking_forward to your swift reply !
negative	booked an executive all leather interior mercedes minibus .
negative	got an old , dirty , rusty bus instead and had 00 vips to take from london to ascot !!
negative	just about made it .
negative	the driver turned_up 00_mins late and was unshaven and didn_'_t really know where he was going .
negative	one of the vips had to direct him all the way .
negative	appaulling !!
negative	didn_'_t even get an_apology and still_waiting for a refund !
negative	rude , clueless and down right insulting .
negative	ordered a wedding dress from a seller here and when the dress arrived it was 0 sizes too small .
negative	the seller then told me to got to a tailor to have it altered as it would be cheaper_than funding a return .
negative	pointed_out to said seller that as she had not given any written notice before the sale that she didn_'_t fund returns , it was her obligation to do so .
negative	i acted on her request however and consulted a tailor who said because the dress was that small , the whole look of the dress would have to be completely changed and rather_than paying for a dress , i would have just paid for expensive fabric .
negative	i contacted asos and paypal , and paypal agreed that the seller had to do something about the dress .
negative	but hold on , asos didn_'_t agree .
negative	after getting very vague information over the matter from the seller , asos informed me that i was a liar and a thief and that i had been given a full_refund ( according to their system ) and had to return the dress .
negative	( fyi , i was offered a partial_refund from seller to cover an extreme alteration , and never received a full_refund although the seller had used the asos sellers system to say that i had ).
negative	0_weeks_later , after arguing my case and informing asos that i wanted to return the dress , i have been issued a full_refund and it was agreed that asos would send a courier to pick_up the dress .
negative	as of today however , i have just been rudely_told by a ' senior_manager ' to keep the dress and put an end to the matter due to asos arranging couriers that cannot keep to agreed time frames to pick_up a collection .
negative	it seems that asos don_'_t understand that losing a days work either loses myself or my employer money , and thus means i cannot stay in all day waiting for a failed attempt to collect the item .
negative	i have used my statutory_rights throughout the whole_process and paypal , and legal services have confirmed that everything i have written and sent has_been correct and in line with the uk distance sellings regulations .
negative	this didn_'_t stop asos from calling me a cheat , liar and a thief .
negative	please , for your_own safety as a buyer , do not use the asos marketplace until you have fully researched who you are buying from .
negative	asos still seem to allow sellers to sell items even_though the response by the customers reflects that the items they are receiving are incorrect and unable to be returned when they have been given no warning about this .
negative	asos , it '_s disgusting that you can promote such incompetent idiots to ' senior ' positions who clearly have no understanding about buying and selling regulations within the uk and who refuse to protect their customers when all they have done is purchase in good faith and have used their legal rights when they have received unfit items . the whole episode has cost a lot of time , money and effort and with my wedding day approaching , has only made matters worse with me having to find an_alternative dress in a very short_space of time .
negative	as a loyal_customer of nearly 0 years , i regret to say that i will shop with you no_longer .
negative	i '_ve ordered several items from a well_known company for business advertisement .
negative	and each one being delivered by city_link ( professional trespassing )
negative	what the issue is with city_link is that their drivers are not educated in knocking on a persons front_door before leaving a delivery with them .
negative	last month i ordered a box of 000 business_cards .
negative	a couple of days_later i came into my kitchen at the back of the house after_hearing a noise and found my item sat on my kitchen windowsill in the rain .
negative	the driver had unlocked my back gate and left my parcel .
negative	they hadn_'_t even bothered to come to my front_door and i was sat in the front room at the time .
negative	i contacted the company i had ordered from and city_link as my item has_been waterdamaged .
negative	they informed me a replacement would be sent .
negative	a few_days_later , the same thing happened again .
negative	driver unlocked backgate and left item outside on windowsill .
negative	i complained to city_link who didn_'_t answer any_questions on why their drivers were trespassing on property that was clearly locked up , and not even bothering to come to the front_door .
negative	my item was replaced again , this time to be greeted with a driver with the attitude of a pubescent 00 year_old male .
negative	he shoved my item in my face , told me to sign for it and he left .
negative	a couple of weeks_later i had to order an_alternative item .
negative	this time the trespassing driver had returned .
negative	the driver banged her fists on my kitchen window , dumped the parcel next to the drain and was off , through the gate that she had unlocked again .
negative	i had ran into the kitchen with fright due to the nature of her abrupt delivery , with a shaken 0 month_old in my arms and spotted her on my drive way .
negative	so city_link , the next time i order and you have to deliver , if your driver ever trespasses on property that is clearly locked and is not to be accessed by the public , i will file a complaint with the police .
negative	i have a front_door !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	we ordered an expensive item last_year and was told we would receive it within a couple of days .
negative	we tracked , it never came , however yodel seemed to think that they had been to our house .
negative	i worked from home for a week to receive my item .
negative	they said we weren_'_t there and i begged to differ .
negative	after numerous exasperating phone_calls i was told i could come and collect it at their nottingham branch .
negative	so i went only to be confronted by the most ridiculously idiotic member of staff possible .
negative	she denied that there was any note left for me to pick my item up and that even_though i had travelled 00_minutes to get my item ( that i had paid delivery for ) she wouldn_'_t give it to me ( as it was against policy ).
negative	funny how that changed when one of their delivery drivers walked in on our heated discussion , and asked her why was it such a problem when all he had to do was walk out the back and get it .
negative	i showed him proof of how long we had waited and the tracking_number and that was the end of the matter .
negative	until the huge foot mark and dent in the box was spotted on nearly_£ 0000 worth of equipment .
negative	since then i try to avoid anyone that uses_yodel as a courier service .
negative	i '_m not sure_whether they are the cheapest option or not , but surely the revenue in having to give refunds due to their lack of courtesy and care , as well as navigation is costly enough to stop using these delinquents to deliver goods .
negative	clowns .
negative	i '_ve had a 00 month_contract now for about 00months , with a phone that was brand_new at the time .
negative	since i '_ve had the horrid contract it has_been nothing but a pain !
negative	i '_ve not been able to make calls everytime that i '_ve wanted to , they just won_'_t connect .
negative	even in emergencies nothing !
negative	in this period i have been passed from_pillar to post with different conclusions as to what the problem is .
negative	they won_'_t open a case but apparently my phone keeps saying it '_s not registered to the network !!
negative	it gets registered every time i phone , but it has still not been corrected .
negative	they can surely see that on their system but choose to ignore it and put me through the same grueling proceedures .
negative	you can '_t even report them to the fsa because they need to be able to give you the " i can '_t do nothing more about it " situation before they '_ll consider looking into it .
negative	after this long period of time i '_ve come to the conclusion myself that :
negative	i certainly won_'_t be renewing my £ xx a month_contract with them again :-( absolute_waste of money and time ..
negative	i was looking_forward to seeing jesus christ superstar at leeds arena and booked with viagogo - should have looked at these review before i booked because they really are rip_off merchants .
negative	i don_'_t know how they have the cheek to firstly charge double for the actual ticket price on top of a booking_fee and n enormous delivery charge .
negative	i could have flown myself to holland and picked the tickets up for the cost they charged !
negative	then horror upon horror when we got there we were on the send last row of the 0rd tier and our view was so restricted because of a stupid design fault at the arena as the ceiling_lights stopped us seeing the whole stage and especially the screen at the back of the stage and it really spoilt the show .
negative	there was no mention on the website that this ticket was restricted_view or on the ticket .
negative	i certainly will be trying to get my money back or go to trading_standards .
negative	don_'_t touch these sharks !
negative	flowers arrived 0th_feb and ion time for my mothers_birthday however they were wilting and not fit to display so unfortunate as my mum was of ill_health and sadly_died 0_days_later it was her 00th on their arrival i reassured her that i would contact the company and try and put things right despite my e_-_mails to serenata they have not replied as yet
negative	we had to cancel our room due to personal issues 0_days prior to stay and no one returned my call , i had to chase someone the following_day and just got an_email_saying ' no ' basically .
negative	considering i requested to book on the 00 / 00 and didn_'_t get a confirmation of booking until 00 / 00 ( only 0 before stay and within 0_days cancellation period ) i was disappointed we couldn_'_t have come to some arrangement .
negative	please mail back and tellme where my udon noodle order is i have been waiting now since the 0 september .
negative	i hadtoorder somelast week from somewhere_else , they delivered in0 days .
negative	and they were cheaper .
negative	so please_please_please can i have my orderbefore weekend .
negative	i don_'_t think i shall be using again
negative	i would like to comment on the quality of the goods if only my basket were to arrive .
negative	never in all my years of online shopping have i received such appaling service .
negative	i ordered a basket and money was taken from my account on 00th_july_0000 .
negative	to date ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i am still waitng for my goods .
negative	no apology , email update or single word from online baskets since the end of july .
negative	having signed into this site i am now inundated by emails for another part of the company business home_brewing which adds insult to injury .
negative	trying to cancel my order requires a letter sent by registerd post ...
negative	what kind of company is this !
negative	take warning prospective buyer that there is no chance to contact the company by telephone and any email sent recieves no reply or response should you receive poor service .
negative	order on a saturday for delivery for a monday between 0 . 00 - 00 . 00 and finally receiving your order after 0 emails ...... at 00 . 00 ..... disguisting service , would never recommend to a friend ...
negative	i wanted insurance for my holiday .
negative	how can your system alter the dates i put in .
negative	then i couldn_'_t cancel .
negative	i spent a day before christmas trying to order photo products .
negative	i gave up on the bauble because the preview image didn_'_t look anything like the promotional photo ( i intend to report this to asa ).
negative	i gave up on the mug because it kept distorting the image and the person on the live_chat couldn_'_t help ( i ordered a mug from moonpig instead which took 0 min to do ).
negative	i built a calendar and a cushion and went to check out .
negative	for some reason , only the order for the calendar was accepted and a message came up saying that for operational reasons the orders had been split but i wasn_'_t able to click on anything to proceed with the cushion order .
negative	by this time it was midnight so i emailed the help_desk and went to bed .
negative	0_days_later i got a rude and unhelpful email back which basically said the orders are lost , sorry about that , nothing i can do .
negative	by this time the last order date was approaching .
negative	i felt that he could have at_least asked me to rebuild them and he would make_sure the orders were dispatched on time or he could have offered a discount but nothing , just rudeness .
negative	i felt that he was annoyed by the lateness of my order but he knew nothing about my personal_circumstances nor why i was ordering so late ( my baby son had been in hospital for 0 nights and was only just home ).
negative	so i ordered the calendar from photobox ( again which only took a few mins and was much_easier to use than jessops ) but i had no option but to order the cushion from jessops because i couldn_'_t find anything similar elsewhere that would still deliver in time for christmas .
negative	i checked the last order dates for the product and thought i was still in time .
negative	but i was mistaken , as it turns_out the final order date had been the day that i had tried to order the very first time .
negative	the cushion arrived yesterday - not quite in time for christmas .
negative	i have ordered lots of items from jessops in the past , but never again .
negative	flowers ordered for a birthday , did not arrive and still_waiting .
negative	no personal service or communication .
negative	ordered a pair of chanel_sunglasses , price seemed to good to be true and was ....
negative	one thing this company are extremely good at is taking money out of your account promptly , when it comes to delivering the goods that you have ordered or refunding money they are abysmal .
negative	basically i ordered a pair of chanel_sunglasses at the beginning of the month , and began to get slightly_worried that i had received no confirmation of my order 0_days_later .
negative	so i rang and asked for confirmation of my order in writing they stumbled and mumbled around " their systems " before telling_me that unfortunately they had sent my confirmation_email to the wrong_address .... after telling them how unprofessional this was especially if any of my payment details were in the email they eventually agreed to resend the email , unfortunately the lady in customer_services slammed the phone down before i had a chance to thank her .
negative	the next_day and the confirmation_email had still not arrived , so i had to ring again .....
negative	this time i did get speaking to someone_who handled my query extremely well who explained that the email had again been sent to the wrong email address ( by the way my email adrress is exactly the same as my name ) and promised that the email would be sent immediately .
negative	the customer service rep then went to check how long it owuld be before the glasses were delivered , and after faffing_around for 0 minuted was unable to give me any more information that 0 - 00 working_days ....
negative	after close to 00 working_days i began to get a bit_concerned as i had received no dispatch email so again rang the company to find out what was going on .
negative	again when they eventually did find the order i was told that unfortunately the sunglasses were no_longer available as they had been_discontinued several_years_ago .....
negative	when i asked how they were able to take my money for items that did not even exist they were not too forthcoming as usual .
negative	so after declining to choose another pair of glasses i asked for a refund which i was told would be in my account in 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	guess_what ?
negative	0 working_days_later and still no sign of any refund however when i asked why 0_days ago was told that the accounts_department had forgotten to refund the money but it would be processed the same day ... silly me ....
negative	by the way after finding out that the glasses had been_discontinued i found them with another company ( pret a voire ) who price matched the sunglasses_shop fictional price and had them on my doorstep by lunch_time the next_day , exceptional service especially by their rep called wu who actually stayed in work late to ensure my product was dispatched the same day .
negative	a few_months_ago i used a company on e_bay i saw a victorian renaissance skirt and also wanted a 0 hooped petty coat there wthey then said they would sent another outfit by courieras a phone number that you had to phone even_though it was on ebay . the people were helpfull and my husband pad over the phone . we were advised that the skirt and petty coat would take a week .
negative	well over a week passed but no skirt and petty coat . my husband rang the company up to be told we will look into it the person rang back and said that parcel had been sent by royal_mail but they had no record of it ???
negative	?. they then nplied that maybe a neighbour had our parcel or worsestill we had received it we said no we hadn , t they then said we will courier you a new costume in 0_days no costume came . we then over a week tried to contact the company and sent emails which went_unanswered we ended_up contacting the bank to get our money as this company had taken the money straight out . it , s the 0st time we have ever had to do this and we did get money back from bank . i , m not saying every compnany on e_bay is like this but i , m now slightly_wary of ebay as that had been our first experiance of buying and it wasn , t great .
negative	i '_ve been trying to top up my father - in - law '_s mobile with a voucher .
negative	haha , more fool me .
negative	trying to text 000 fails , i get a text_telling_me its an invalid number .
negative	going online gets me in a loop , and when i finally find the right page it tells_me the phone number isn_'_t valid , and that the system will now be locked , whatever that means .
negative	ring customer_services with the last 00p credit , the automated selection ( choose 0 , choose 0 etc ) takes me in another loop , then says no credit remaining , thanks for ringing , goodbye .
negative	ok , so i can chat online with someone , that '_s good , really fast response ( although i suspect it '_s automated , strange replies to my questions ).
negative	guess_what ?
negative	the person can only deal with sales enquiries , not technical , goodbye , thanks for calling .
negative	i suggest anyone with t - mobile ( or orange , who have also gone down the pan since the ee merger ) gets the hell out and finds another_provider .
negative	total_nightmare .
negative	i may bill them for the £_00 voucher plus the 0 hours of my time , all wasted !
negative	the staff were incredibly helpful with dealing_with problems , but wouldn_'_t use the site again .
negative	i ordered the item just under a week_ago , the money has left my bank_account and still the item has not arrived despite the website saying it will take 0 - 0_days .
negative	still_haven_'_t heard any news on where it is or when it will arrive despite the fact i no_longer need the item of fancy_dress .
negative	total_waste of time and money !
negative	ordered a beautiful bunch of flowers for my friend , the bunch she received looked nothing like the bunch i paid for .
negative	what should have been an impressive stunning bouquet was nothing but a dull bunch of toot !
negative	not what i '_d expect from £_00 - not satisfied .
negative	i won_'_t be using you again !!!!!
negative	get flowers elsewhere peeps !
negative	must_say that since this they contacted me and gave_me a full_refund - still won_'_t be using them again though .
negative	be warned .
negative	my husband booked this ticket for me , using his card , after two_days i got a mail from you saying my booking is cancelled due to payment problem , while we checked his account we find out that money is already taken by ebrookers .
negative	since then we contacted ebrookers many_times via phone and email , two months over still we haven_'_t received our money back , we are still_waiting for this , i hope the person_who is reading this message can understand our problem now , we are really unhappy about all this problems , we are financially struggling due to this , we might contact some expert soon , so we could get our money back .
negative	my order has not even arrived yet so i am very disappointed !
negative	wish i '_d seen this website prior to leaving for the maidstone studios today .
negative	arrived early ( not hours but as is a new comedy show & in maidstone didn_'_t expect it to be inundated .)
negative	well surprise_surprise we were turned away with the poor promise of priority tix for next series - if it gets recommissioned .
negative	waste of time & petrol !
negative	this company is a joke .
negative	i have a suggestion where they can shove their priority tickets .........
negative	i ordered and got an acknowledgement .
negative	got a phone_call to say my order was coming but would be late .
negative	no problem , until the phone_call from the restaurant saying they didn_'_t deliver to my postcode .
negative	no dinner .
negative	what sort of service is this ...?
negative	and i had to give my card no so don_'_t know if i '_ve been charged for the food i didn_'_t get .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	told me my phone was faulty and only paid me £ 0 . 00 , phoned to complain and they wouldn_'_t send me my phone back have contacted trading_standards rip_off merchants !!!!!!!!!
negative	staff are rude and unhelpfull
negative	we paid £_000 for two tickets to the big reunion .
negative	when we received the tickets , the cost of them was £_00 each not £_00 as we had to pay .
negative	we paid nearly_£_00 for delivery and many other charges .
negative	won_'_t be getting tickets from viagogo .
negative	nothing startling i wanted something that looked like i '_d spent effort choosing it and was worth the cost but i was disappointed
negative	after appalling service i wrote an honest review of victoria_plumb giving them a one star_rating .
negative	minutes later this review was removed for ' investigation '.
negative	i guess victoria_plumb requested that .
negative	i hadn_'_t put my order confirmation in and that was requested .
negative	ive since sent it to them via_email 0 times yet you refuse to post my review .
negative	your site is a pharse you are only interested in posting positive or mildly negative_comments .
negative	i wonder_if these companies who you pander to and ensure no one sees the true poor service they provide support your biased unfair website ?
negative	i wouldn_'_t be surprised you make very good bedfellows .
negative	for the avoidance of doubt im posting my order ref here .. you '_ve had it 0 times already .
negative	this is apparently your reason for not posting its eh00kww0y0sb0h .
negative	have you even looked at your_own reviews on here ?
negative	ironically you probably get the poorest rating than any of the companies you support .
negative	i say support as its clear that is your interest .
negative	you have no interest in the customer and accurate representation of service .
negative	you removed my review and asked for order confirmation before reposting .
negative	i sent this on asap .
negative	irritating to see you still have not posted my review .
negative	order ref eh00kww0y0sb0h now post this !
negative	!
negative	as you can see i have posted my ref_number numerous_times i have included it in this review , i have mailed it to trust_pilot 0 times_now and had no response - they clearly don_'_t want to post negative_reviews and will remove this within minutes of it being up .
negative	i have spent almost £_0k with this company and have been completely messed about .
negative	i received a call from the delivery company stating that they would not deliver as booked ( confirmed and paid for ) 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i advised them i was unhappy with this as i can '_t take days off work as i am a contractor , this is specifically why i booked a weekend slot .
negative	also i had arranged for a team of plumbers , tilers and electricians to come on 0 / 0 which i would have to re - organise at less_than a weeks notice .
negative	the delivery company said they would phone me back on saturday - they did not so i wrote to victoria_plumb via the website on the saturday .
negative	i received no response .
negative	i then called victoria_plumb on monday and spoke to a person_who advised me they would call the delivery company and i would be called back on the monday as the slot had been booked for sat that should be honoured .
negative	i received no phone_call .
negative	i then called you again on tuesday and after a 00 minute wait being charged all the while i was advised that my record said the delivery company had been contacted and there had been no record of them changing / cancelling the date and it would be delivered as promised .
negative	later that day i recieved an_email_saying they would not deliver because item ' would not be ready ' and it would need to be delivered a week_later .
negative	they stated they had tried to contact me was a blatant_lie as i had been in the the house all day and had no phone_call whatsoever .
negative	i had no voicemails on either my mobile or my house phone .
negative	after much invoncenience i managed to rearrange all my workmen and arrange for an unpaid day off work after email_confirmation it would arrive on the new date specified .
negative	i also called ( another wait ) and this was confirmed verbally on the phone .
negative	no text from the delivery company the night before to say it would be delivered and guess_what - no bath .
negative	i am sick to the teeth of them i called again - more expense i must have spent over_£_00 on calls to these joker .
negative	don_'_t touch them with a bargepole .
negative	if i could put 0_stars i would have .
negative	so an update on the saga .
negative	another delivery was booked for friday 00th - not the best date granted - and i was given a slot of between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
negative	arrived home at 00 : 00 and waited .
negative	00 . 00 came and went - no bath .
negative	called vp not amused again and was told that they '_d call me back .
negative	i was called back and told the bath was ' on its way , there were 0 stops before mine but it would def be delivered on the fri . 0 . 00pm arrived , you '_ve guessed it , still no bath .
negative	conscious that their call_centre closed at 0 i called again .
negative	i was told yes mrs russel it will be with you , we will contact the delivery driver and call you back to confirm .
negative	before you leave tonight i enquired , ive sat in all day i don_'_t want to have to sit in all friday_night unnecessarily , yes he promised .
negative	it won_'_t surprise you to hear i received no call .
negative	upon leaving the next_morning i found a courier car half shoved through my letterbox stating that they had delivered at 00 . 00 on the fri and left my bath at the garage next door !!
negative	surely if the delivery slot begins at 00 . 00 the courier should wait_until that time before delivering .
negative	as it is they shoehorned it into a very small office at the premises next door - something i had not advised them they could do - and left it .
negative	upon collection the next_day they box was all torn and bashed .
negative	this product is still to be inspected , i wouldn_'_t be surprised at all if it was damaged .
negative	as i am pregnant my husband had to get help to move the heavy bath into our property .
negative	not an easy feat !
negative	its not in our kitchen as we simply couldn_'_t get it up the stairs as we wait installation ( which isn_'_t until next week as we are at the installers mercy having had to cancel then twice due to vp incompetence ).
negative	all in all a really painful experience i will never order with them again and won_'_t be shy about telling others about this treatment .
negative	we have been offered £_00 compensation - ive probably spent more than that in phone_calls and this is yet to appear in my account despite_assurances this would be there over a week_ago .
negative	i won_'_t hold my breath .
negative	very , very disappointed with the level of service offered by allbeauty .
negative	i ordered a perfume during the first week of december , giving me plenty of time for the last christmas order date of the 00th .
negative	it had still not arrived past the maximum 00 days stated so i emailed them .
negative	they said it should be with me shortly .
negative	a few_days_later , still nothing .
negative	i emailed them this weekend stating how anxious i was as this was a christmas_present , today i got a response telling_me they had cancelled my order as it was no_longer in stock and that my card would be refunded .
negative	completely_unacceptable , i will never be using this site again and advise you not to .
negative	had a bad_experience last june / july with kitbag that took around 0 - 0wks to resolve , never used again until before the world_cup .
negative	ordered a shirt from my son which arrived with the wrong number on , spoke to an advisor who promised me a new shirt would be printed the next_day & couriered overnight .
negative	this shirt never arrived that day or the following_day , foned them up & the numbers hadn_'_t arrived in stock , yeh they hadn_'_t thought to update me .
negative	i ended_up getting a refund & shopping elsewhere .
negative	ps if there was an option off zero_stars , that '_s what i would give them .
negative	order number :_00000000
negative	i could have easily got the same amount of flowers from tesco for a 0 / 0 of the price - wont_be using you again sorry .
negative	was promised a call back within 00min and did not receive a call for 0_days .
negative	then called back and nothing had been noted down by that customer service representative .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	very .
negative	if you want to print your voucher like they tell you to do dont try because you cant
negative	not happy with discounts here .
negative	they are dearer_than some places but i joined for the first discount which took me ages to finallt get .
negative	i recommended but the person coukdnt get discount either as same ( average ) prescription .
negative	i now habe same prescription as my daughter so presumed i was ruled out too .
negative	found a better firm and would not use again
negative	after receiving a broken part from one of the company '_s listed , we tried to sort it out direct with the company but had no joy .
negative	we left poor feedback comments twice on parts_gateway site but apart_from the original mediation there has_been no response .
negative	we commented on the sale of goods_act 0000 that the part was not fit for purpose .
negative	there is poor lack of contact with parts_gateway .
negative	just very disappointed with " your move "' s attitude_towards our offer negotiations in a house really ...
negative	in the final offers they never got back to us with the other buyer '_s final offer and had the property as " sold "!
negative	awful and very unprofessional attitude !
negative	we just lost the property which ticked all the boxes and were not given the right to bid for it !
negative	:(
negative	awful company , poor customer_services , empty_promises , do not use this company .
negative	ordered a bean_bag , with groupon_voucher , at the beginning of november , had many promises and excuses from infurn , but still no sign of the bean_bag , just a continually changing delivery date .
negative	infurn do not communicate with their customers until pushed to do so .
negative	if there is a genuine problem why not keep their customers informed via_email .
negative	i am now trying to get my money back .
negative	since the 0_months of posting this , no word from infurn and certainly no money ( it should be noted groupon have been great and have had a been bag delivered through another company ) .
negative	really i would like to give infurn zero starts .
negative	if they do read these , i would hope they have the decency to reimburse money they owe to customers .
negative	i still have not recieved my refund
negative	yet again the parcel didn_'_t arrive when it should have .
negative	the delivery man made no attempt to knock on our door - we were in - and to make his getaway as swiftly as he possibly could the idiot put the parcel in our green dustbin which was at the front of our property .
negative	it was bin collection day and only because by_chance we noticed the bin had been moved slightly we got to it before the bin men emptied it !
negative	every time we have ordered from davpack we have been heartily let_down by the amateurs they use as their delivery people - and as delivery charges are not cheap surely there is a better firm out there ?
negative	i placed the order and waited and waited ......
negative	i tried_emailing numerous_times and each of these were ignored and then i called to be told the crib was not in stock and i '_d have to wait .
negative	the staff_member i spoke to showed no customer service skills whatsoever and sounded_like he wanted to be anywhere but dealing_with customers .
negative	i did ask to speak with the customer service director / manager as i was not happy with the level of service i received and he told me i had to email in my complaint - i told him , i had tried that method but as they don_'_t respond to emails , this was pointless !
negative	i eventually changed the order to something that was in stock as i had already waited 0_weeks for something that their website said was in stock .
negative	do not deal with this company unless you want to wait weeks and deal with a company that does not pride itself on customer service !
negative	this company just takes your money and runs , no afterthought was given to us the customer , they managed to get everything wrong and would ' nt even try to fix the problems we had even_though it was their fault , in the end i contacted abta and they " persuaded " this dreadful company to refund us our money in full , would warn all who are considering using them .
negative	the flower arrangment i ordered was a casket arrangment for my mum '_s funeral .
negative	the flowers were terrible and only fit to go in the bin .
negative	i have seen better flowers being discarded not delivered as a funeral tribute .
negative	the lilies that were open were all brown and papery , the buds that were not open were wrinkled , brown spotted and were obviously going to open brown if they opened at all .
negative	they were very poor quality .
negative	it made a bad day terrible even after i had been assured by the help_desk prior to purchase that the flowers would be of good quality as i was concerned because i do not live_near to where the funeral was taking place .
negative	although i was assured of the best quality arrangment and service before i placed the order the flowers were delivered the day before not the day of the funeral although i received an_email_confirming safe delivery whilst_travelling to the funeral , so even the tracking of order and delivery is not a true_reflection of service provided
negative	i cannot stress enough how disappointed and upset the whole episode made me and my family at one of the worst times possible .
negative	i instigated a complaint on thursday , the day of the funeral and was told on the friday they would not be able to get back to me on monday .
negative	on the monday i was told that the delivering florist had taken photos of the arrangment and that they were of good quality , as a result i offered for them to speak directly with the funeral home to verify the truth of my statements as to how bad the flowers were and gain an_independent view but was not contacted back but sent this link to post a review instead .
negative	i did explain on my reply that the flowers from the alternative source had been kept and even after a journey of 000_miles and 0_days of being in completely the wrong environment were still fresher than the dreadful arrangement delivered by their agent .
negative	i also asked for details of someone at the company more senior i could direct my complaint to and was ignored
negative	i arrived at the undertakers early after travelling over 000 hundred_miles and had to re - order some more as an_emergency which made the funeral late .
negative	i did not anticipate having to replace and pay for another arrangement with just 00_minutes notice and the only acknowledgement of my complaint being offered is a complimentary bouquet in the next 00 months .
negative	as if i would want to go through this experience again !!
negative	!
negative	i have not been offered a refund and i feel like my complaint has not been taken_seriously or accepted by this company , my advice would be to please_avoid_disappointment and go elsewhere and i shall make_sure i pass this information on to all i come into contact with in the future .
negative	my mum deserved better_than the service this supplier provided
negative	i recently went to cuba for 0_weeks and before i went , i phoned customer service and asked about any international usage packages so i wasn_'_t bankrupt when i came home .
negative	i was told by gurtesh in the cairo call_center in these exact_words " as long as you use wifi , you will not be charged for using the internet ".
negative	he went on the tell me quite patronizingly that wifi is through your handset and not your sim .
negative	i checked into my hotel , bought wifi access cards to last my holiday and kept in contact with my partner and family back home .
negative	i used facetime connected to wifi and facebook and i sent a handful of emails so i could keep in touch with my uni tutor .
negative	i contacted vodafone customer service as i had sent a few texts whilst away as well and my bill was £_000 . 00 due to data usage .
negative	i expressed a very explicit verbal dissatisfaction with this to the adviser at the fact that i had been lied to by a colleague and while i know i was wrong to swear , i think it is far worse that the adviser swore back at me .
negative	i can be extremely hot headed at times especially when faced with a phone bill as big as my mortgage but i always apologise when i '_m in the wrong .
negative	i got no apology from the adviser , just a supernanny style warning that if i did it again , she would hang up .
negative	i '_d have preferred her to hang up instead of cursing me out if i '_m honest !
negative	i '_ve posted this on the vodafone forum too and the response from the " expert " was to check that my data roaming was off and / or my cellular data .
negative	i '_ve checked it and the only one that advises to be turned off when travelling is the data roaming as it specvifically states on the iphone that it incurs costs abroad .
negative	the cellular data says it disconnects all wifi access and email etc which i still needed .
negative	as far as i was concerned , the expensive bit was disconnected and that was of my own initiative , not even at the advice of vodafone .
negative	to top it all off , they want to charge me so i can see the bill and i have been hung_up on by 0 advisers today when i ask to speak to a manager .
negative	they all state there are no managers on the floor which is illegal as a manager has to be present at all times to deal with issues and complaints which is definately what i want to make but i am being refused at every turn .
negative	i feel a bit_cheated that i '_ve had to resort to writing on a forum to express my comments but it seems the only way to get it seen by someone with a bit of power about the situation .
negative	i have rated this one star because i have to , not because i wanted to .
negative	the returns process is very poorly explained , they email in very abrupt short sentences and don_'_t seem to follow_up on assurances .
negative	shoes are poor quality and every pair fits badly be it too small , too_big or too narrow .
negative	i '_ve sent back every pair i '_ve bought .
negative	shocking .
negative	my partner had a mobile internet contract with them but since_moving in with me had no need for it .
negative	he called at the end of june to give 00 days notice and was advised to call back after the 00th of july to give immediate notice and to ensure no more payments were taken .
negative	he called back on the 00th of july ( today ) and was told that he had been misinformed and that the call he was making was his notice period and another charge would leave his account .
negative	after 00_minutes to a premium_rate number , the advisor finally said that the earliest he would be able to cancel is the 00th of august anyway as this was the expiry_date .
negative	my partner queried_why the charge could not be over looked due to loyalty and the fact he had been paying for a internet_connection he hadn_'_t used for about 0_months .
negative	he was informed by the member of staff that loyalty only meant something to them when they were taking out new contracts to get better deals .
negative	when my partner asked to speak to a manager or a supervisor , he was conveniently told they were in a meeting until close of the call_centre and a call back would be scheduled for between 00 and 00_hours .
negative	when my partner advised that this would not be convenient due to his working hours , he was basically told tough_luck .
negative	the advisor kept pressing the mute button while my partner was talking so about 00_minutes was spent repeating himself .
negative	it was absolutely_disgusting how he was treated and to be told outright that loyalty only counts when you want to spend more money is beyond a joke .
negative	box arrived via courier badly_damaged with contents on display .
negative	the instructions_enclosed were for a completely_different model of trampoline .
negative	two springs were missing from the box .
negative	the mat didn_'_t have the advertised logo in the centre or a white cross so my children cannot clearly see the centre spot when bouncing .
negative	the website stated that it takes an_hour to put_together .
negative	he took my husband ( who is good at diy ) and son nearly six hours to put_together .
negative	i tried_phoning sport & leisure about the missing springs .
negative	no one answers their phone .
negative	i tried_emailing and got a phone message back asking me to phone them .
negative	tried again .
negative	no one answered .
negative	this went on & on even_though my email was very clear that i needed two more springs .
negative	they sent me a new mat straight_away ( not requested ) and finally after six_weeks and endless emails , they sent me a whole box of springs !!
negative	i won_'_t use sport & leisure_uk again .
negative	it is almost_impossible to speak to a customer service advisor at t - mobile .
negative	the automated phone system is designed to make it as hard as possible to speak to a human unless you want to buy something .
negative	and when you do get through , they will tell you it isn_'_t their department , so now i have to write a letter , for a simple query , to get a copy of my credit agreement .
negative	i am so cross !
negative	over half an_hour of my life wasted battling with a company who apparently " really value my custom ".
negative	took my phone over to their office in farmoor as couldn_'_t contact them by phone , was told i would get it back the next_day ... 0_days_later finally got my phone back and a yellow spot had appeared on my screen , it also warps if any pressure is put on the screen , tried to call them numerous_times , they didn_'_t answer their phone , have emailed them with no response ... pants repair and pants customer service ... won_'_t be using them again !
negative	!
negative	truly gutted to have wasted £_00 on this service and to have the issues i have experienced since !
negative	!
negative	i was attracted to iflorist by the lovely arrangements and pledge to deliver on actual mothering_sunday .
negative	they happily took my £_00 from my account a couple of weeks_ago but blatently never delivered .
negative	not on mother '_s day or any day .
negative	no attempt to contact us , no apology , and they ' re ignoring my emails .
negative	i really wish i had researched these people beforehand as i would have discovered the trail of customer disappointment they seem to routinely leave .
negative	this company should be investigated .
negative	tried to buy a washer_dryer which would have been much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else i '_d seen it .
negative	ordered it and was phoned the next_day to say that they didn_'_t have any even_though the site had said they had plenty in stock .
negative	thought it seemed too good to be true .
negative	was then phoned a week_later and told the same thing .
negative	waste of time .
negative	i '_m amazed this company stays in business with their delivery service .
negative	i received an_email_saying what day my item would be delivered and it never came .
negative	when i called to see where it was , i heard a long_drawn_out problem they are having with their orders that are going through argos .
negative	first of all , i have my own problems , i don_'_t want to hear yours .
negative	just deliver it when you said you will .
negative	and then they still couldn_'_t promise it would be delivered the next_morning !
negative	you '_d think if they knew they had a computer problem and they knew items were not being delivered , they would contact the customer rather then make me stay home all day waiting for an item that wasn_'_t going to be delivered .
negative	i don_'_t want to hear your problems , i want results and proper customer service !!
negative	!
negative	ordered a king mattress online .
negative	they delivered a double .
negative	the driver just left it and said nothing he can do , contact sainsbury '_s .
negative	called a very loud call_centre and told i '_d be contacted within 00_hours .
negative	never contacted .
negative	after a lot of calls back and forth , i was told mattress is " made to order " and it would not be available another 0_weeks .
negative	delivery company very rude !
negative	cancelled order and will not order from sainsbury online again .
negative	sent a few boxes of items in with a range of items in varying condition .
negative	completely_understood that some of the books were very old , ( as most people , i had added them a little opportunistically in the hope they '_d be accepted ) but very concerned that some items which were brand_spanking new ( and conveniently worth more money ) were rejected as being damaged !!!
negative	ziffit '_s terms and conditions state they cannot return the items - how very convenient !!
negative	!
negative	i had likewise sent a load of items to one of ziffit '_s main_competitors as they were offering more on some items and had no_problems_whatsoever .
negative	i would suggest to others to physically take them to a trade - in place and accept or reject an offer on the spot in person so you can walk_away with your goods in your possession if they ' re unhappy with the condition rather_than being robbed blind as i have !!
negative	!
negative	damage was made to our car and after numerous phone_calls & emails , we are not getting any response as no one seems to be interested in the damaged they have caused to our car .
negative	the after service is an_absolute_disgrace !!!
negative	will never use this company again
negative	we never order pizza but as a treat went for the 00 . 00 offer , which was so heavily advertised on tv .
negative	never trust adverts , they lie , it was nothing like it was depicted & tasted much worse !
negative	possibly the lack of topping , it being cold , smelling foul , looking like it was made with the no possible care , helped towards its total failure .
negative	never buy pizza from dominos , as you '_ll only be very disappointed and hungry , because you couldn_'_t possible eat such bad food .
negative	i ordered rose_plant to be delivered to my sister as her daughter was getting_married and i wanted to provide her with a living memory rather_than a bouquet .
negative	i received confirmation that '_s it would be delivered on 0 / 00 , but on the evening of 0 / 00 i had a phone_call to say that due to a misunderstanding it would be 0 / 00 but promised it would be in time for the wedding .
negative	at 00am i received another call from customer_services to say that the rose_plant we had ordered was not available but they could deliver a bouquet with a few extra flowers thrown in at their expense , so i had to accept this offer under duress as the only_thing i could achieve .
negative	the flowers were delivered in time for the wedding , but , what a shambles .
negative	so never ever again .
negative	i ordered an aeg dishwasher on 0 march_0000 and was told it was not in stock but it should only take 0 to 00 days .
negative	i called after 00 days , on a thursday and was told it should definitely be in by the next monday latest wednesday .
negative	the next thursday i called again and was told definitely next week .
negative	when i pointed_out that i was told last_week that it was definitely going to be in this week he was quite rude and said that it was not their fault that their supplier was out of stock .
negative	when i asked if he could contact his supplier to find out when they would have them in stock he said that he could not find out and that they can not track the deliveries either .
negative	they cannot find out when any delivery is next due , it just arrives and then they can contact us .
negative	he was just plain rude .
negative	i rang again the next thursday , same old story , should be in next week .
negative	i asked if i could cancel the order and was told that was fine , but i probably would not be able to get it elsewhere any quicker .
negative	i waited another 0_days and had found the same dishwasher at hispek , who had it in stock and could deliver it in 0_days , it only cost me £_00 . 00 more .
negative	so i called redhill again to give them 0 more chance , but was still told that it should be delivered next week , but no guarantees .
negative	i cancelled the order on 0 april_0000 and they took my credit_card number and i was told their accounts_department would deal with it , but it could take up to 0_days to show as an credit on my credit_card .
negative	00 days_later i called my credit_card company and they had not yet received a refund .
negative	i got them to send me a dispute form as i have wasted enough time calling redhill , who will just lie and lie again to you as i have found out by reading your reviews today .
negative	redhill appliances seem to be brilliant , when they have things in stock , but the worst when it is out of stock , they just take your money and then don_'_t care and take ages to refund you .
negative	it is now 00 april but still no refund .
negative	i wanted to buy from a local supplier but will definitely not recommend them to anybody .
negative	no customer service whatsoever , rude , bored sales_staff who don_'_t seem to care one bit about their customers .
negative	do not buy from them !!!
negative	!
negative	i '_m a regular customer at photobox and after this recent_purchase i will still be a regular customer to photobox .
negative	the software is basic with little manipulation available and i still_haven_'_t received my order even_though it was ordered weeks_ago .
negative	when i phone to find out where my order is i had a standard message to say its on its way
negative	i was travelling on my own with a 0 and 0 year_old so booked meet and greet for the easy option - how wrong could i have been !
negative	their instructions said on arrival at the airport go to passenger pick_up which was incorrect and they actually meant passesenger drop_off which cause stress and confusion as i went to the wrong place initially .
negative	on the way home the instructions said call them when i was waiting for my baggage which i did .
negative	from this point it took them 0 hour and 00_minutes to bring my car back .
negative	absolutely awful service .
negative	thought i would order a photo_jigsaw for my sister and when i did was not told that it was coming from germany .
negative	rung up about it on tuesday 0 december and was told it would be with me by friday 0th .... no it has not arrived .
negative	my husband was able to order presents from ebay from china after me and they arrived in three_days !!!!!!
negative	what does that say .....
negative	sadly , i would love to be one of the many customers whom are delighted in their reviews .
negative	after purchasing a [_external_reference_] coupon , and deciding after looking at the products to use it as part payment , and opt for a larger_size frame , upgrading and paying the additional amount owed .
negative	as stated by the company that i could do .
negative	however , due to an issue during the payment process , the company have left the funds ' pending ' rather_than withdraw them fully .
negative	paypal state that the order needs to be processed by the company . when i enquired_about the order status as i was eager to receive the canvas , the email i received back was offensive in tone , by being very condescending , and assumed the error was the fault of my inability to use a very simplistic ordering process .
negative	they took the time to enclose an idiots step by step_guide , by not the time to actually track the order .
negative	telling_me i had mistakenly_ordered the wrong_size !
negative	if i had not experienced problems , i would say that the simplistic ordering is great , and the ease of use fantastic .
negative	sadly , after many emails from my side , attaching proof of payment and order confirmations , i am still_awaiting any hint of whether i shall receive my canvas .
negative	as emails are unanswered and assurance via the telephone unfulfilled .
negative	very saddened and looking at the other products offered , upset as i would of ordered many more in the future .
negative	it would seem that as long as the order is straight_forward then a good service , sadly , please be aware that if a problem is encountered you may be left hanging , or ignored .
negative	after asking whether i should cancel the payment and re - order , no answers are forthcoming .
negative	so i am left , confused , frustrated and deeply upset , as it appears to be only myself trying to come up with solutions .
negative	i am very happy for those other customers that have received a good service , but also wish to just advise those that may in future have a problem .
negative	i bought 0 tickets in feb ., from viagogo , to see eric clapton at leeds arena on june 00nd .
negative	0000 .
negative	the tickets arrived on sheets of a0 paper , with someone '_s name and address crossed out in the top left hand corner .
negative	when we presented the tickets at the event , they were rejected and classed_as void , because the scanning machine did not recognise the transaction .
negative	we had travelled a fair distance and in order to see the show , had to purchase completely new tickets costing a further £_000 . 00 .
negative	i would like a full_refund of £_000 . 00 and an_apology , please .
negative	this was a very unpleasant and embarrassing experience and i am most upset that i was ripped_off .
negative	by the way , we have managed to read the name and address crossed out on the tickets !
negative	transaction_id_:_0000000
negative	thank_you for your swift action .
negative	i am happy to give you a 0_* rating now !
negative	c la 0ème fois_que_je_commande_et_je_suis très déçu . la 0er fois bien_passé pas_la 0ème .
negative	j ' ai_fait mes achats sur_le net et payé avec les_frais_de port pour_la france .
negative	j ' ai bien reçu un mails de leurs part pour me dire_que_le payement était validé ,
negative	que ma_commande est en préparation et puis il me renvoie un mail en me dissent deux semaines plus_tard qu_' il ne peuvent pas m ' envoyé ma_commande parce qu_' il_y a eu une erreur de leurs part que_les_frais_de port étant plus élevé de 0 dollars et tant que_je_ne paye pas_la différence le_colis ne serais pas envoyé .
negative	c lamentable d ' attendre presque 0 semaines avant la dates de_la cérémonie pour me dire qu_' il ne me livrerons pas parce qu_' il manque 0 dollars .
negative	c ' est grave il_n ' assume même_pas leurs erreurs .
negative	c dommage parce qu_' il ont beaucoup_de produit mes pour_moi ce sera la dernière commande .
negative	i ordered what i was lead to believe a very expensive ( full price was just under_£_00 ) flower_arrangement for my mum for mothers_day , this arrived partly dead and was very small and the flowers which i was lead to believe would be included were not , it was full of cheap carnations .
negative	i emailed advising of my dissapointment and was told they would send more flowers , these arrived and again not very nice and died witihn 0_days ( even after following care instructions ) both arrangements together were not worth the price i paid and i have to say i could have got the same amount of flowerd but better quality from my local_supermarket - my advise would be to stay clear of iflorist
negative	ordered from this company 00nd_march_0000 have received neither item or refund eventually purchased goods from another site .
negative	a courier came and collected my dvds and games in november - i am still_awaiting payment .
negative	i have emailed them several_times and have had a few replies apologising for the delay and assuring_me that my cheque will be sent out in the post that day , it still has not arrived .
negative	the website states it will be received within two_weeks .
negative	as far as i can gather they have stolen my goods and have no_intention of paying .
negative	* update * i have rang consumer_direct and advise everybody else to do the same - the number is 00000000000
negative	it was terrible , order placed well before 0 so expecting same day delivery as advertised , just got a message left saying they had no availability and order had been cancelled .
negative	when i tried to ring at 0 :_00pm there was a message_saying their_offices were now closed and their opening_hours were until_0pm ???
negative	terrible experience would never recommend or use again
negative	i ordered a case of brown brothers shiraz but received only six bottles of the shiraz and six bottles of tarrango .
negative	i sent two_separate emails immediately to drinks_direct and have not had the courtesy of a response .
negative	i sent one through their system which says you will receive a reply within an_hour , and when several hours_later that had not been forthcoming , i emailed them again .
negative	i have still not had a response .
negative	all i have received is this asking me to rate my customer_satisfaction .
negative	i was reluctant to deal with the company after a bad_experience two years_ago , but thought i '_d give them the benefit of the doubt - i am now regretting that decision .
negative	march 00 made ​​ the order .
negative	one of the items indicated in stock , waiting for 0_days .
negative	as a result , an order was sent on april 00 not only of the mail , which i agreed with the supplier !
negative	today , may 0 , sending me so far not been received .
negative	this is my second order in the store .
negative	now think whether i will have something here to order !
negative	found a card through the door saying delivery attempted .
negative	i was in !!!'
negative	there was no knock or anything !!
negative	no phone number on the card , no details nothing .
negative	next two_days same thing then email_saying we '_ve not been able to deliver to you .
negative	not heard_anything since .
negative	you '_ve got my money i '_ve got no product .
negative	absolutely rubbish .
negative	would not use you again and am still_waiting for money or product .
negative	don_'_t use them .
negative	waited for weeks to get my order , then got the wrong order and now i '_ve got to prove they have sent me the wrong glasses before i get the pair i '_ve paid for months_ago !
negative	sent them a photo as requested but still not good enough - avoid !
negative	* just to clarify as select_specs have suggested my review is misleading - i sent select_specs a photo as requested and they sent me a returns_label .
negative	i asked if they would now send my original order as i had paid for it a month_ago and had waited 0_weeks to be sent the wrong glasses .
negative	i was told no , they would re order ' my ' glasses when they had received the glasses that had been sent to me in error .
negative	apologise if anyone has_been misled .
negative	from the very start this was a bad_experience .
negative	i was charged_twice .
negative	the voucher_code didn_'_t come off my bill .
negative	the duplicate order was fianlly cancelled but not refunded .
negative	then i was informed my order would be delivered on friday and i would receive a call on thurs .
negative	no call .
negative	i called 0 . 00 and the man said someone would call by 0 .
negative	0 pm came and went .
negative	i called back only to be told no delivery was scheduled and they had no idea why i had been told it was coming on friday .
negative	ermm ...
negative	your staff told me less_than half an_hour ago !
negative	well still no furniture .
negative	still no delivery date .
negative	will be interesting as no more holidays .
negative	pine_solutions you suck !
negative	purchased sofa and chair on their guaranteed 0 day delivery ........ three_weeks_later no sofa , it turns_out that there were none in stock , and that it would have to be made .
negative	never promise something that you cannot achieve .
negative	euthymol toothpaste is difficult to source at present .
negative	as a result i had no option but to purchase from your company at a ridiculously inflated price .
negative	almost 0 times the normal price .
negative	i ordered the o ring seals kit for a bristan mixer shower .
negative	the one o ring missing was the one needed by the plumber which seals off the flow of the water when turning the shower off .
negative	because this was missing from the pack i had to pay out £_00 of labour charges whilst he drove round various stores looking for an o ring to fit , and the best match found didnt work , so ive had to purchase a new cartridge now - from somewhere_else , as i dont want to risk being sent an incomplete item again from national_shower_spares .
negative	if a friend asked me about this company i '_d say you get what you pay for , i . e .
negative	the cheapest price has led to more expense in the long run .
negative	cheap is not always cheerful .
negative	i placed my order 0_weeks before mother '_s day .
negative	as the day drew nearer , it became_clear that the order was not going to arrive .
negative	i notified customer_services and because they are so awfully inflexible , i was told that i had to wait_until the parcel had been missing for 00 working_days before anybody was prepared to help me .
negative	so , i had no gifts for mother '_s day and still_haven_'_t .
negative	the order has apparently been resent but i have reservations as to whether it will arrive .
negative	awful service and no compensation offered to soften the blow any !
negative	unless somebody makes such a gesture , i won_'_t be using again .
negative	i work in customer_services myself and would never expect a customer to wait such time before i resolved their issue - worse of all , i still have no order !
negative	it wasn_'_t even offered special delivery !
negative	poor , very poor .
negative	i bought an iphone_0s on contract as a present for someone overseas , all was explained to orange company and they said they were going to unlock the fone within 0_months .
negative	when i phoned up after 0_months i was told 0_months .
negative	after 0_months i called again and was told 00 days i have now been waiting for more than 00 days .
negative	i called them again today and been told to wait for another 0 hours for a fone call not even an unlocking code .
negative	when i tried to compain the lady hung_up on me around 0 am .
negative	i find that so rude and unacceptable behaviour .
negative	what was the point of buying this phone then if the person cant even use it .
negative	i '_m just fed_up and this is the second time they have treated me so badly .
negative	useless !!!!!
negative	busy advertising lies !
negative	!
negative	i was pleased to order from you but after paying for the goods and getting a reply telling_me that the supplier let you down i was annoyed .
negative	sent 0 cards on the 0 / 00 / 00 and the 0 recipients of the cards only received them 0day ... thats 00 days for delivery , thats too long , especially with it was £ 0 . 00 for the delivery ..!
negative	then i was told by both people that the invoice was attached to the front of the cards , stating the price i had payed .
negative	how embarrassing ....!
negative	both said the cards were nice ... i haven_'_t seen them ..!
negative	i had sent a birthday card on the 00 / 00 / 00 to my uncle and he still_hasn_'_t received it yet and his_birthday is now , long over ... but hopefully it will arrive soon ..!
negative	i '_m_sure with the invoice attached to it ..!
negative	overall not a great service ...!
negative	wont use again ..!
negative	i ordered two large items in october_0000 and both have failed .
negative	they are not fit for purpose .
negative	the top panel of the vanity_unit is swelling up and cracking presumably due to humidity in the bathroom .
negative	i spoke to customer_services who insinuated it was my fault for not making the wet_room steam - free rather_than agree that a piece of furniture designed to go into a wet area should not swell up and crack after 0_months .
negative	they did agree to replace the unit so we '_ll see if the new one is any different .
negative	the other large item i bought was one of the most expensive wcs as all the cheaper ones were out of stock and i needed it urgently .
negative	the quality is appalling .
negative	the back of the top part of the wc is not straight and it does not align with the rest of the unit .
negative	i was not in when the plumber fitted it and it would have cost me a lot of money to ask him to take it off and fit a new one .
negative	for this reason i didn_'_t report the problem immediately to vp .
negative	i '_ve been pondering whether i can live with it or not and the answer is no .
negative	it has come off the wall because it '_s all wonky so actually it is not fit for purpose .
negative	unfortunately vp take the view that i should suck it up because i didn_'_t complain immediately .
negative	now i have to decide_whether to take legal_action for the cost of the wc as well as the plumbing costs to replace it .
negative	it really isn_'_t fair that i should be out of pocket after buying from this company .
negative	i am so very disappointed with this company and i would strongly_urge_everyone not to waste your money and order somewhere_else .
negative	this was one of the worst experiences of buying online !
negative	i ordered some thrush medication and they wrote back to me that i could only have one capsule .
negative	other_sites just don_'_t let you order i '_d you exceed the quantity allowed inadvertently .
negative	anyway i wrote back and said to just send me the one capsule and refund the rest .
negative	then i received an_email_saying my reply was in a queue and i had to be patient !!
negative	i tries ringing them for two_days in a row and spent a small_fortune but no one ever answered i was on hold forever .
negative	then the following_day i sent them another email to say not to bother to send it because it was too late and i would just buy somewhere_else .
negative	again i got a reply_saying to be patient !
negative	finally the following_day i threatened to contact trading_standards and they finally refunded .
negative	absolute_nightmare !!
negative	!
negative	you get what you pay for .....
negative	long_queues .... even_though we had already checked in online it was longer to queue to drop our bags off than it was to check in ; flights delayed both_ways ; the service on the flights was appalling - on the return flight it took 0 0 / 0 hours to buy drinks ( the flight was 0 hours long ); we had children under 0 - but they loaded us into a coach with everyone else - and then we had to run for the plane .
negative	absolute_rubbish - i would rather part with more money every time from here on in .
negative	i ordered more than £_000 of bathroom furniture from this company on wednesday 0th_november_0000 expecting it to be dispatched the following_day .
negative	by the friday , the status of my order was still showing as " processing " so i thought i would try their live_chat service to find out what was happening .
negative	i was told my order was out for delivery .
negative	a short while later i went back onto live_chat to find out if they meant my order would be delivered that day or if they meant it would be delivered on a different day .
negative	at this point
negative	i was told that " live_chat " had no access to existing orders and i would have to phone an 0000 number to check my order status .
negative	i explained that i had already been told by " live_chat " that my order had been dispatched already .
negative	the operator then said ok - i will check for you .
negative	he came back to me and said it would be delivered that day so i made sure the was someone in at all times to take delivery and guess_what .
negative	- it did not arrive .
negative	i also made sure someone was home all next_day but still no delivery .
negative	this morning monday 00th_november i tried " live_chat " again only to be told that theyg have no access to existing orders !
negative	i phoned the 0000 number - it was more than 00_minutes before i got an answer .
negative	the lady i spoke to said that my order had been cancelled !
negative	i explained that i had not cancelled the order and she said she would check up and get back to me .
negative	after 00_minutes and no phone_call from them i got back on to the 0000 number and got through to a gentleman by the name of suheb - it took more than 00_minutes before my call was answered and then i was kept on hold for several more minutes before he came back to me and said he would have to do some more checking .
negative	at this point i had had enough of forking_out for expensive phone_calls but still not getting an answer to my problem and cancelled the order .
negative	i asked how long it would take before i got my refund and he said between 0_0 working_days .
negative	strange phenomenon because the money left my bank_account the day i placed the order .
negative	anyone taking bets that i get my refund without_any_problems .......?
negative	booked a car at glasgow_airport - when i arrived there was no vehicle available .
negative	after waiting at the hertz desk for 0 . 0 hours and speaking to a representative on the phone they agreed to cancel my booking with hertz and transfer me to enterprise but at a much higher cost which i refused .
negative	eventually , they agreed that i would get my vehicle at the original price and hertz would make up the shortfall .
negative	i then had to transfer to the enterprise desk and wait there while my booking was being_processed .
negative	some 00_minutes later the enterprise representative asked me for more money than i had agreed to on the telephone so i refused .
negative	i had no more time to take the matter up with rentalcars . com as i was on my way to attend a funeral and had to leave the airport and take a taxi .
negative	they took the cost out of my bank_account and when i complained they refused to refund the full_amount and charged me £_00 . 00 as a cancellation_fee despite the fact that i had been kept waiting for almost 0 hours and i did not cancel my booking - enterprise wanted more money than i had agreed to pay .
negative	avoid these crooks at all costs .
negative	i have bought 0 phones from different stores online and both_times have been refunded .
negative	the first i got a generic email_stating a problem and got my refund but second time , from hyde , didnt even get the curtesy of the email , just got my refund .
negative	can only guess they are too lazy to update the website properly .
negative	ended_up buying the 0 phones on amazon for less_than cash_generators were charging anyway .
negative	wont_be using again , would have rated as 0 but it wouldn_'_t let_me .
negative	will go to amazon or ebay for future_purchases .
negative	at_least i know they are in stock and will receive them .
negative	the 0 to 0 day delivery never happened !
negative	its 0_days now and still no costume .
negative	no answer to the phone number either .
negative	so now i have to go out and buy another outfit !
negative	!
negative	just hope i can return the order if it ever arrives .
negative	i ordered flowers and wine for my aunt & uncles christmas_present and paid for a specific delivery day .
negative	the flowers arrived a day late , and i received no email update as stated in the terms and conditions .
negative	there was no bottle of wine delivered .
negative	i contacted the company several_times , and used the online_chat which was a waste of 00_minutes of my time .
negative	the chat person said she was talking to multiple customers and after 00_minutes said she would pass my concern to the concerns dept .
negative	i emailed about 0 times and got my first response after 00 days , refunding the bottle of wine in which they didn_'_t even offer to re - deliver .
negative	i had to fight for a refund on the delivery charge as only part of the order was delivered and still a day late and unfortunately by then it was too late for me to get a replacement present for christmas .
negative	poor communication and customer service , a real let - down , wasting so much of my time to resolve .
negative	myukdelivery failed to collect my item on 0 separate_occasions .
negative	talking to [_name_removed_] is a joke as she knows nothing .
negative	i sent a recorded delivery letter to their website address citing breach of contract & demanding a refund & it was returned undelivered !
negative	do not use this company
negative	my boiler stopped_working on the 00th_november , no heating or hot_water . i rang them and they said the earliest they can send an engineer out is three_days_later on 00st .
negative	my boiler has a reset button which i pressed and i also tried turning boiler off and on but did not work .
negative	any way the engineer came in the 00st , pressed the reset button and it started up .
negative	he said he did not know what the problem was so could not order a part .
negative	he gave_me a diary to complete should it fail again with questions to answer to give a better idea as what was wrong .
negative	the boiler lasted 0 hours before stopping again .
negative	i rang them straightaway and this time the earliest they could send an engineer was 0_days_later on 00 november .
negative	to make_matters worse i had a burst water pipe from the bathroom which flooded my dining_room .
negative	this is not drying out properly due to no heating .
negative	i was in despair , felt unwell and depressed .
negative	the engineer came on the 00th and said the boiler needed a part which they did not have in stock so needed ordering .
negative	he said the customer service team would contact me that afternoon with an_appointment date .
negative	they did not ring me i had to ring them .
negative	they said the part on order would be in stock on monday 0nd_december and when it comes in they will then contact me with an_appointment date .
negative	i asked them if they could make a provisional date now rady for when the part comes in and they said their system does not allow them to rechedule in that way .
negative	i told that it made sense to make a provisional appointment which they could them give to somebody_else if the part is not in on time and again they said that cannot do that .
negative	i asked for and idea of how long i would possibly wait for an_appointment once the part is in and he said " about 0 or 0_days " ( in other words how long is a piece of string .
negative	by the time my boiler is fixed and up and running i will have been without heating and hot_water for 0_weeks .
negative	this company i '_d quick enough at taking your money but runs it on a shoe string where engineers are concerned .
negative	i am waiting til my boiler is up and running and then i am taking my business elsewhere .
negative	do not use eon for boiler repairs
negative	i was recently looking around to buy a bmw in the chesterfield store , i was brousing the cars outside for quite a while and not one member of staff came out to assist me , they were clearly too busy chatting inside .
negative	i was quite appalded by this as they had obviously seen me .
negative	i decided to leave and bought a car elsewhere .
negative	poor quality goods , missing and damaged items .
negative	extrememly poor after sales_team , poor organisation , very poor customer service and constanly being hung_up on .
negative	it does not seem like an illegitimate company i dont_know how they havent been shut_down yet .
negative	its been 0_months since my kitchen arrived and im missing half of it , and in all that time they have sent me one door !!
negative	extremely disappointed !!
negative	even by sending them this email will be a waist of time as i am guarenteed no response as once they recieve their money they could care less about their customer .
negative	i have purchased several groupons in the past ( never again ).
negative	often what appears to be a good deal transpires to be the same price as standard or something cheap and substandard put_together for the sake of groupon , i feel this is the fault of groupon mis selling the products .
negative	the customer service team are not very helpful , they fail to respond to emails and are impolite if you actually manage to speak to someone .
negative	stay away from this company and hopefully they will disappear and no_longer rip us all off .
negative	do not shop with this company .
negative	their products are of poor quality and after returning for a refund they ignored me , refused to acknowledge the return despite me having tracking evidence and did not refund me .
negative	so they took my money and the goods .
negative	their treatment is despicable , even by the director .
negative	absolutely_appalling !
negative	as i write i am_currently being billed by both europa , and telfonica for the same line rental .
negative	when i call europa they say they will investigate and call me back - do they ?
negative	that will be a no then .
negative	so far my 0 emails to 0 different_departments have gone unanswered .
negative	when i moved recently , i cancelled my line with them and took up a new one .
negative	you won_'_t be surprised to learn i am now being billed for 0 lines , but wait , i notified them and they apologised for the error , promised me a refund against my new account , and promptly billed me again .
negative	i had the payment stopped at my bank , so they have now issued me with a debt warning .
negative	what a bunch of wasters .
negative	i am now approaching a new supplier - enough is enough .
negative	never ever use expedia .
negative	they cannot handle the simplest hotel booking , and when attempted to correct the errors , you might as well be dealing_with martians .
negative	also , they attempt to make out that it '_s the fault of the consumer , particularly galling with me , as a highly qualified oxford graduate .
negative	you have been warned !
negative	o stars
negative	thank_you for your letter .
negative	flower bouquet witch was delivered was completely unrelated to that one which was ordered from the site !
negative	delivered bouquet was made from different flowers , was smaller_size and worser quality .
negative	this is very disappointed me .
negative	dana
negative	i ordered eflorist flowers for my mother in laws_00th_birthday on mon 0rd sept for courier delivery in banff scotland on thurs 0th_sept . they did not arrive until sat 0th_sept at 0pm in the local postman '_s red van !
negative	when the flowers failed to arrive on sept 0th i spoke to a charming and very helpful customer service agent at eflorist who agreed to a partial_refund and pointed_out the terms and conditions of my order :
negative	wait for it : delivery dates to the highlands of scotland cannot be guaranteed !
negative	despite the fact that banff is in mainland britain and lies equal distance between inverness and aberdeen , 0 of scotlands largest cities !
negative	and yes , they do have a daily mail and parcel service there !
negative	at no stage of ordering were any scottish anomalies highlighted , or warning that my delivery could be 00_hours after the requested date .
negative	my question ?
negative	i gave eflorist 0_days notice to deliver .
negative	if the order could be delayed by 00_hours why was it not despatched earlier to allow for this known and expected delay .
negative	if you use this service please read all the terms and conditions before placing an order !!!!
negative	!
negative	am planning on ringing bedeck later as only one if two items has shown up and the receipt in the box said two items should be there .
negative	i am sure it will all be resolved when i ring and speak to someone
negative	i didnt_realise these werent hp branded cartridges , they were generic ones .
negative	they printed ok for a day before becoming patchy and not printing properly .
negative	i did order a few so i changed it again and once again worked a couple of times before doing the same thing .
negative	have since gone and bought hp branded and had no_issues .
negative	wont_be using this company again , unfortunately because the service was exceptional but the product was not .
negative	i would not use topcashback ever again !!
negative	it has taken 0_months to get only a third of the cashback owed , they then told me i had to wait a further 0_months for them to investigate .
negative	never again !
negative	!
negative	i posted my express00 parcel at 0 . 00am from east_london to be delivered to central_london the next_day .
negative	i checked at 0pm that night and the tracking_info said it was last tracked at the east_london depot at 00 : 00 - so at_least it left the post_office - but then , against the tracking it said " collection attempted - parcel not available " and also " refused acceptance " at 00 : 00 which looks like the receiver would not take it .
negative	it could not have been delivered in 0 . 0 hours , so what does it all mean ?
negative	where is my parcel ?
negative	was it just not ready at the depot to move to the central_london depot ?
negative	or is it lost ?
negative	i was and am so worried .
negative	do i just wait as it is meant to be a guaranteed delivery .
negative	this is an awful experience with vague comments which could mean anything .
negative	i had an express00 delivered to the same address 0_days ago without a problem .
negative	and why does customer_services close at 0pm when people may still be travelling home .
negative	i would be very reluctant to use this service again .
negative	this was a very special parcel for christmas as i baked my very first christmas cake and was sending it to someone special .
negative	i ordered and paid for goods on 0 dec . a week_later , as the goods had not arrived , i emailed them and they said they were having trouble getting supplies .
negative	they offered me 0oml bottles for a couple of pounds less_than the 000ml_bottles i '_d paid for !
negative	i asked for my money back 0 times and on 00 dec they said they '_d paid it back to my credit_card account .
negative	have just had my bill and guess_what ?
negative	no refund .
negative	customer_services are not answering the phone .
negative	if they do this to many people they will get quite a bit of interest on our money !
negative	shan '_t risk using them again
negative	using the courier service you do means i am still_waiting to get my goods as they appear to deliver only during early day whilst i '_m at whilst i '_m at work and there is no instructions on how to contact them to arrange delivery when i '_m around .
negative	if i had realised the delivery problems i would have ordered from elsewhere .
negative	may yet need to claim money ack anyway from credit_card if i do not see my goods today .
negative	very very disappointing service from your sub contractor that reflected badly on overall experience .
negative	i have filled a suit with this company .
negative	they sent me the wrong order , then sent me a dhl invoice to send , dhl never came .
negative	walked_into the local carphone_warehouse to take back a faulty phone charger !
negative	obviously having disturbed the staff from their slumber i was never going to be treated_courteously but was basically told it was my fault the appliance was broken and i '_d voided the warranty !!
negative	have never been spoken to so rudely by a retail worker and will never cross that threshold again !
negative	ordered a dehumidifer which arrived with the plug bent , emailed them and heard_nothing for 0_days so employed an electrician to sort_out the plug costing me £_00 .
negative	emailed go - electrical to say i was out of pocket and would they refund my expense , they said they were sending out a replacement - this was unnecessary as i had paid to fix it and asked again for them to refund my out of pocket expense which they refused as they had ordered another one wihtout discussing the options with me .
negative	when i said that if they had responded when i sent the email on saturday then this could have been prevented , they said no one worked on complaints at the weekend hence no response - well if they had set an out of office on their emails i would have know when to expect a response and waited instead of wasting £_00 - so not happy and would not recommend to a friend as i had waited a week in the first_instance as they had not stock and delivery was supposed to be within 0_days !
negative	unable or preopared to wait again .
negative	poor attitude from rude staff - who said they did not wish to be rude but .................!!!
negative	!
negative	last_year i booked a holiday for me and my disabled_mother .
negative	asked to be near amminties .
negative	but was put at the reat of the park but that was , nt the worst of it .
negative	it backed onto a 00hr industraul estate .
negative	when i triead to post a review 0 times on there own review site .
negative	they would not publish it untill there customer service team have spoken to me .
negative	im still_waiting .
negative	but have noticed they only publish good reviews .
negative	but not bad ones .
negative	so i suggest to people not to trust there review site .
negative	as its not honest .
negative	if park holidays wish to contact me they can :- dp jonah .

negative	we are being forced to shop elseware by tesco being a partners with costa .
negative	( costa a lot .)
negative	we used to shop at tesco perival and then about five years_ago we stated to spend our £_000_+ a week shop went to there hayes middx store and guess_what that store has just becone a cost a lot cafe too .
negative	so we are now lfft only with there osterly store and will contion to shop at that store .
negative	but tesco be warned if you decicde to change ostley cafe .
negative	to a costa a lot .
negative	sainsburt here we come .
negative	dpj000 .
negative	i had to wait for weeks for masterplug surge proter to come into there hayes middx stores .
negative	( the usual argos service .)
negative	i reserved them to go on there on tueday .
negative	only to waste my time and petrol as it was to come in at0000 that day .
negative	so i went back on the friday of that week .
negative	i went to pay with them with capital bonds and the manager refused them saying they was probley stolen .
negative	i went home and rang capital bonds who told me no way should argos have refused them .
negative	i then rang argos headoffice only to get lipservice appoilges and nothing else .
negative	so if like me you should avoid argos like a shot .
negative	they dont half the time have the item you want in stock .
negative	shop at amazon e_bay etc .
negative	which is what i will do in future .
negative	they have a lot better customer_care .
negative	dpj000 .
negative	tesco is driving us to there rivals with there cafes .
negative	we used to go to tesco perival then they bought in costa .
negative	( costa a lot .)
negative	tsince then we have been useing there hayes middx stores for years_now .
negative	and guess_what there hayes store is now a cost you lots cafe .
negative	so now we are limeted to there ostley store .
negative	that is until cost a lot decieds to take there cafe over .
negative	and then we will be taking our £_000_+ aweek shop to sainsbury .
negative	so well_done tesco for shooting yourselfs in the foot .
negative	and losing loyal_customers throucj your prtniship with c0sta .
negative	dpj000 /
negative	i use screwfix a lot . along with toolstation .
negative	but with both companys .
negative	if things go_wrong .
negative	mainy when they ppost things to you0 they take no responyilty for there postal couriers .
negative	which is dam wrong .
negative	but .
negative	my latest experience takes the biscuit .
negative	i went to my local southall store .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	to pick_up a item i had reserved on line .
negative	yo queue up for agais yet again .
negative	as they never have enogh staff there to serve .
negative	they gave_me the item in a bag .
negative	away i went .
negative	only to open it later .
negative	and find it was a used damaged item .
negative	but !
negative	i didnt think i had anything to worry_about .
negative	i just rang customer service .
negative	thinking they would send me another one .
negative	by post .
negative	___ wrong . ___ they wouldnt .
negative	they justinsited i went back to store again .
negative	well i dont_know about you !
negative	but i havent the time to waste in taffic and queinf up again in there store which !
negative	is always short_staffed .
negative	for there error in selling me a second_hand item in the first place .
negative	so i will be giving them a lot less business in future and recomed other people who use them to think elsewhere for there supplies .
negative	and like a lot of reviews .
negative	ive read .
negative	they are getting exspenve i find toolstation .
negative	cheaper in about 00_% of goods anyway .
negative	dpj000 .

negative	we use asda a bit .
negative	the park royal cafe inside its store is crap .
negative	several_times we havent eaten there because the food is overcooked and disgusting .
negative	and when you ask them for something fresh .
negative	they have , nt got it .
negative	because they are too busy standing around gossiping .
negative	cooking food in bulk and leving it around for ages .
negative	three_times we have complained to its managers .
negative	and to head_office .
negative	although they make the right noises .
negative	abuot there cafe staff nothings done .
negative	i suggest asda pays there cafe staff a decent wage .
negative	and sack there present park royal cafe staff .
negative	and to any customer who . s thinking of eating there .
negative	_____ dont . _______ unless you want food poising .
negative	i bought an item which they showed as available .
negative	i had a confirmation_email to say it would be delivered in 0 - 0_days .
negative	thriteen days_later i rang and emailed them , was told the item was not available !
negative	they couldn_'_t refund it unless i sent an_email to cancel .
negative	no notification - really let_me down big style !
negative	would never use again and will not be recommending to anyone .
negative	theses flowers were for a birthday and looked nothing like the photo online !
negative	they were shabby and poor !
negative	will never use this site again !
negative	we ordered the product to come the next_day and paid 0 . 00 for the privaledge , 0_days_later we got it !!!!
negative	!
negative	the product was far too small and when i tried to return it i was told i could not get a refund as it had been tried on !
negative	the girl i spoke to was rude and unhelpful .
negative	i will never shop_here again !
negative	the sofa , coca , is not the best quality .
negative	the cushions are far too soft to have any durability .
negative	the supposed teflon coating that i was promised when i paid £_000 extra is non_existent .
negative	after sales ( i cant bring myself to call them customer service as this would be misleading !)
negative	is utterly dreadful , so no matter if the sofa was free and superb quality i would not recommend nor use again .
negative	entire system is utterly ridiculous , going round and round in circles .
negative	have had to make so many phone_calls , and literally hour , to cancel my package and get a refund , every time with unhelpful staff who spin a .
negative	i have spent more on phone_calls trying to get my refund - nearly_£_00 .
negative	i will never use sky again
negative	cut me off when trying to call them .
negative	ignored a final_bill i had paid them and tried to charge me again .
negative	messed_up my meter so that i was no_longer paying on the correct meter number .
negative	took 0_months to try and close an account , the fact that they are still trying to invoice me after i paid a final_bill is ludicrous .
negative	i have phone and broadband with talk_talk .
negative	since tiscali was taken over by talk_talk , more_expensive poor products , bad service , non - existant customer service , impossible to contact anyone , slow slow slow connection via broadband , keep selling me extra products that never materialise .
negative	stores understaffed .
negative	empty shelves .
negative	short_dated produce .
negative	response to customer feedback is very poor .
negative	staff on the tills are doing their best under poor management .
negative	although the item we ordered was of good quality & arrived quickly when we tried to return it things went very wrong .
negative	i returned the item within 00_hours of receiving it on the 00th_may .
negative	nobody ever answers the phone , despite_repeated emails & phone messages over weeks they have failed to respond to my request for a refund .
negative	finally after_posting on both their twitter & facebook pages they responded through facebook to say my refund has_been sorted .
negative	but as of today no money has_been refunded .
negative	a very disappointing experience all_round & i '_m £_000 . 00 out of pocket .
negative	see below for details ...
negative	please could you explain_why my parcel has still not arrived .
negative	despite using the tracking services provided by yourselves and amazon which differ widely in what they say , i am still unable to find out what is happening .
negative	i have also sent two mails through your website and have had no response ,
negative	after a phone_call to customer_services i was told delivery had been attempted 00 / 00 , i had left a note on the door asking for it to be left with neighbours if i was not home ( no card was left ) and it would now arrive 00 / 00as it had been placed with another courier .
negative	as you were the specified courier i was surprised by this .
negative	still it did not arrive .
negative	i was then told then told today that there is an issue with my address and delivery couldn_'_t be guaranteed for today as it wasn_'_t clear if it had gone onto a van .
negative	if there were an issue with my address , which as it stands there was not , my address matches exactly the address you had .
negative	i would have thought someone could have contacted me , or indeed checked it when i called you .
negative	this is not the first time i have had issues with yodels service , but it is the most frustrating as i now have to wait in again .
negative	if a card had been left , if indeed delivery had been attempted i would have been able to contact you and arrange a suitable day .

negative	i ordered from this company mainly_because of the quick delivery time ( 0 / 0_days ).
negative	i received the item nearly 0_weeks after order placed .
negative	on my first phone_call ( 0_days after ordering ) i was told the item would be sent out that day .
negative	i was unhappy about this but accepted their assurances .
negative	my next call was 0_days after ordering and was again told it would be sent out that day .
negative	the person was not interested that i had been assured on 0 previous occaissions that the item was being despatched because i couldn_'_t provide the name of the persons i had talked to .
negative	the item finally arrived 00 days after ordering .
negative	i had given up on ever receiving the item so ordered from another company and it arrived after 0_days and on the same day as the item from one click pharmacy .
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	their customer service to me was non - existent .
negative	would not buy from them again they have totally lost my custom .
negative	we want to buy some fags but my mate has no i '_d at all and they refused to serve us .
negative	but then a 00 year_old girl did not get asked to be i '_d so how can they get away with this
negative	what a pile of rubbish
negative	i ordered a bunch of flowers for mother '_s day .
negative	i especially chose this website as it said they delivered on mothering_sunday , and i wanted this as a nice_surprise for my mum .
negative	i paid £ 0 . 00 for the postage which i thought was reasonable .
negative	without me realising , while i was in the process of ordering , it automatically updated my order to a medium_sized bunch which was an extra £ 0 . 00 .
negative	i was not at all impressed with this as i didn_'_t notice it until after i had paid , but decided to leave it as it was mother '_s day .
negative	after finding out that my mum had not received any flowers on mother '_s day , i sent an enquiry to prestige_flowers that evening asking where they were .
negative	i received a quick reply , which was a nice_surprise for a sunday_evening , but i was told that as stated in the small_print on the website , there was no guarantee that my flowers would be delivered on the sunday , but that they could take an extra working day .
negative	this was not made clear at all when i made my order .
negative	by wednesday the flowers had still not arrived , so i sent another message asking to just cancel the order and receive a full_refund as the mother '_s day surprise had been completely_ruined !
negative	it is now thursday and still no flowers and no reply to my email !!
negative	i have just sent another email chasing it up but am not very hopeful anymore .
negative	not happy at all and will never use again !!
negative	!
negative	i '_m waiting on the delivery of a new mobile phone ( not an i - phone ) that was arranged to be delivered yesterday , but no - one was in to sign for it so i got a sorry we missed you card which is fair_enough .
negative	but i '_ve taken today off work to make_sure i was in for my delivery , but instead i '_ve got an e_- mail telling_me that dpd attempted to deliver my parcel and no - one was in .
negative	well i am in , and have been in all morning .
negative	no calling_card was left , so they clearly just didn_'_t attempt to deliver it .
negative	there seems to be no way you can call the company and speak to anyone in person either .
negative	not impressed
negative	rubbish i ordered a ninja suit in next_day delivery , no where did it state that orders after 0pm would only be do r the following_day , plus it was ordered at 00 : 00 so was only just afterwards , item turned_up and was rubbish quality far too_big and i will not order fron here again
negative	ordered a trampoline for my son on 00th_march for next_day delivery - it arrived on the wednesday .
negative	we went to put it up for him on the saturday only to discover that we had several extra bits and pieces in the delivery which obviously didn_'_t go with the trampoline we had ordered .
negative	once we had worked out which bits we needed we started to put it together only to find that part of the frame was missing and we were short of 00 springs !
negative	i contacted the help_desk and they were very helpful and apologetic and promised to send the missing items out asap - a delivery duly_arrived on the tuesday however the frame part was not on the delivery , the wrong amount of springs had been sent and they were a different size from the ones which came with the original delivery !!
negative	i have since been on the phone to the help_desk and all the people who i have talked to have been very apologetic yet i have asked for a manager to contact me 0 times and as yet have had no phone_call .
negative	to say that i am disappointed in the service and obvious lack of care which the warehouse take with processing orders would be an_understatement .
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	update based on response ;
negative	dear steve , many_thanks for your reply .
negative	we do now have a working trampoline however the gift did not arrive - i will double_check on the refund - and 0_days after the trampoline had been replaced another box of springs was sent to us which i sent straight back with the carrier !!!!!.
negative	please_note despite having asked for someone to call since i posted the original review that a manager has never contacted us to discuss the level of service we received .
negative	i would appreciate it if you could ask a manager to call and for the gift to be sent out .
negative	i ordered a hydrangea aspera ' hot_chocolate ' it arrived quickly and well_packaged , that accounts for the one star .
negative	the dead twig i received was so waterlogged there was green slime covering the surface of compost and grey mould growing up the twig .
negative	the remains of the plant were wizened and black .
negative	it took 00_hours to get through to a company representative who said they would send a replacement , which arrived quickly and well_packaged again .
negative	this time the plant was bushy and looked good in the box until i unwrapped it , it was leggy and strained , but worse_than that , it was so dry i could pick_up the plant in a two litre pot with one finger easily , all the leaves were like tissue_paper and most dropped_off .
negative	i stood it in 0 pints of water which disappeared overnight .
negative	i will now have to prune it well down and hope it regrows .
negative	all in all not happy with the experience which cost me £_00 and will_definately never buy from them again and will spread the word amongst every gardener i know .
negative	what kind of plant nursery has a call_centre ?
negative	it '_s obviously just a production line with the result being pot_luck , or not , for the customer .
negative	i have been gardening for 00 years and have never seen such neglect from so called professionals , even supermarket plants are better_than this .
negative	i have been with this company since they took over tiscali .
negative	i have never had to use their customer service until two_weeks_ago when i lost my asdl line .
negative	i am still without the internet and suffered hours of frustrating customer service phone_calls at a premium_rate number .
negative	i was sent all over the world to call_centres that i couldn_'_t understand and only seemed to be able to work from a set of rules in a robotic manner .
negative	technical help didn_'_t call back when they said they would and their was no understanding or sympathy .
negative	i now am leaving i have had to pay bt to give me a new line with broadband and i am out of contract with talktalk but dread phoning them up to cancel my service with them .
negative	talktalk have said that if i cancel my direct_debit they will charge me even_though i have no service .
negative	i have got a mac code from them eventually but bt will not use it because they are supplying a new line .
negative	please_please_please people show this company who has the power and do not go_anywhere_near them and tell your freinds to read all the reviews on trust_pilot .
negative	only then may talktalk realise that they have to stop this appalling customer service .
negative	order placed 00 may .
negative	shipping promised 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	telephone message that despatch should be 0 june , and an_email to be sent confirm this .
negative	no email received as at end of 00 may .
negative	am not impressed .
negative	where is the item i have paid for ???????
negative	?
negative	very slow service .
negative	a week_later no goods .
negative	the package has_been dispatched two months_ago , until now i '_ve never received a word from it .
negative	everytime i send an_email to contact the service center , there '_s only an automatical mail response .
negative	i really suspect if there '_s a real employee working on this part !
negative	well , finally i receive my package in a week aftre filling in the replacement form .
negative	i will strongly_suggest to choose the delivery with charge if u really want to buy sth here .
negative	the childrens ' party did not live up to the description on the website - no dedicated party host , no cosmic bowling with flashing_lights and no dancing with the party host .
negative	despite selection the options to not have email and telephone contact from either ao . com or anybody_else that they felt inclined to pass my details on to i have been inundated with both email messages and telephone_call requesting my recommendations .
negative	why is it that my purchasing a washing_machine from these people is not enough ?
negative	very disappointed - there are several flybe web_sites and prices vary .
negative	the tickets i wanted were priced at £_00 cheaper each person each leg of journey but not available at purchase .
negative	no one is prepared to deal with our complaint in an efficient manner . flybe say there is only one price at checkout but how can you tell .
negative	have to use them as we are on an island and they are the only carrier if we have to fly to mainland .
negative	i ordered my outfit on 00th_october in the evening and opted to pay £ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery so it would arrive on monday 00th , after countless unanswered calls to the customer service team and a still unanswered email it is now 00th with no sign of my order .
negative	i understand that this is a busy_period but not being_able to speak to anyone on a call or have a reply to my email is very poor customer service .
negative	i will not be using this site again .
negative	0 .
negative	purchased samsung_s0 from them in july - the package was sent to the wrong_address and it was picked_up by the resident of that address .
negative	i rang them saying how come my phone was " picked_up " on the delivery status and i am not aware of it .
negative	they accused me of lying and then two_days_later i got a parcel back with the phone inside .
negative	i did not bother ringing them back after that .
negative	0 .
negative	three_months later , i started experiencing issues with my samsung_s0 .
negative	i launched the camera app one day and the whole app froze and nothing would happen , i restarted the phone and that fixed it , then two_days_later i was browsing photos on the train one day and it just suddenly shut_down and would not restart .
negative	0 .
negative	i called them and told them about the issue , they suggested a factory restart so i went through and backedup all the images and data on my phone and they agreed to call me back the next_day - i did not receive any phone_calls from them .
negative	i called again asking if they could send me a new headset now that we '_ve tried the factory restart and confirmed that the hardware is faulty .
negative	they said no because samsung provided a warranty for two years on this phone and because samsung don_'_t work sundays i will have to try calling them back again during the week ...
negative	what ?!
negative	i made the agent aware that i am unable to unplug my phone without the unexpected shutdown and it is causing me a lot of inconveniences , he told me not to worry_about it and that they will sort it out for me - erm , of course i worry_about it .
negative	i '_ve not received a reliable service from this company ... and putting the blame on a vendor is not the answer .
negative	their customer service line is free for three customers , if you want to spend a long time on the phone explaining to them why having your phone fixed right away is important as part of the customer service then do sign up with three !
negative	they simply don_'_t have a concept of customer service .
negative	i ordered a camera worth 0000 from them in september and was advised my order will arrive mid september .
negative	i waited and checked the online status for delivery but the status was not helpful at all , i waited and waited and finally decided to give them a call .
negative	they told me that my package was with custom and should clear in a day or two .
negative	i waited a couple more days and still didn_'_t receive my package , i called again and they said fedex should have contacted me and i should contact fedex if not .
negative	i was not very happy about this considering i am left with no choice but to incur extra time and cost to contact fedex when my contract was with digitalrev .
negative	they promise to pay for your import_taxes on the website but there is no mention of what_happens if custom bills you , so i asked this question in my emails to a customer support agent and never got a response .
negative	feeling helpless , i called fedex trying to sort this out , i was told that uk custom suspects this company is providing false_information to escape paying tax , fedex would need me to provide an invoice for the purchase before they can release the package .
negative	i did this and called digitalrev , their customer service open a couple of hours a day only and the only time someone would pick_up for uk is between_0am to 0am ( which is ridiculous , i either have to stay up late or get up early and make special arrangements before i can report an issue ).
negative	the cs on the phone told me not to provide fedex with anymore information and sent me an invoice for a camera costing 000gbp and the remain of the 000 was shipping and packaging cost .
negative	i was really upset when i saw this and replied asking if they intended to send me a false statement ( as this would count as tax avoidance ).
negative	they said no please ignore it but this was purposely built and it had my name and address on it but the wrong billing information .
negative	i was really questioning my decision to use them and really regret buying from them .
negative	i eventually received the package , the camera itself is fine but with the hassle i went through it is just not worth it .
negative	very slow delivery , ordered perfume and still_haven_'_t received it after 00 days
negative	ordered at 00am , paid for same - day delivery .
negative	received a call at 0pm to say unable to deliver to that area .
negative	too late for me to make any alternative plans .
negative	system sould not take order if can '_t deliver !
negative	v disappointing .
negative	don_'_t think i will be buying clothes again
negative	we ordered a sofa from argos and was informed it would be delivered on the 0th of december_0000 after waiting in all day and with no contact from argos themselves we eventually rang there 0000 higher call charge customer service centre .
negative	this is when the trouble began ...... we were informed the sofa was not even in stock and should not expect delivery until the end of january , unfortunately due to expecting delivery of our new sofa on the 0th of dec we had parted with out current sofa to make room .
negative	due to this we were informed we could choose another sofa which could be delivered in time for christmas with £_00 compensation added on due to their mistake great !!!!
negative	so on the 00th of december we again waited for the arrival of our sofa as promised and guess_what ????
negative	no phone_calls and no sofa .... after_contacting argos '_s dreadful customer service centre we were again informed the sofa we had been promised delivery of for the second time was also not in stock .
negative	it seems argos are happy to sell items they do not have in stock and give customers completely made up delivery dates just to make a sale .
negative	they have no regards for customer_satisfaction and are unreliable and unhelpful in every way .
negative	i would not recommend using argos for any item which requires delivery unless you like surprises and are willing to wait and see when your item will finally arrive .
negative	as above i did but no response from them .
negative	customer service is worst than the hell .
negative	i don_'_t find anything to write beside my anger .
negative	any orders placed during the time advertised will not come on time
negative	avoid at all costs as this company can not get an order wrong go over customers heads and change orders and the options you are on dont ever go with bt
negative	slow connection try to cancel aren_'_t able to i have spent days trying to get them to terminate my account still trying with no success
negative	never go to three avoid at all costs customer service is appealing cant cancel or change your service plan for the whole 00 month_contract have been a 00 customer for years would recommend o0 over three wish i never went to them as theyndont have the first idea on how to deal with complaints leave you hanging on the phone for hours on end in the end i have given up trying to reason with them info hope that when my contact comes up for renewal i will be able to cancel .
negative	absolutely_disgusting service .
negative	no help with my luggage even_though the website categorically said the " helpful " drivers will help you unload and get a trolley for your luggage when departing and help you coming_back too .
negative	i asked the driver to help me with my bags as i had a toddler with me and he said " its not my job i am not doing it ".
negative	i struggled to unload and get a trolley and look after my toddler and he stood and watched .
negative	coming_back was no better .
negative	i called when i landed .
negative	i called again when i got through the security gates .
negative	i called again when i had my bags .
negative	i waited , at 0am , with a toddler , in the cold , for nearly an_hour for my car .
negative	the driver again did not offer any apology or help .
negative	i asked for help and he put my cases in the car for me begrudgingly .
negative	i called the firm the next_day and the man on the phone seemed quite sorry but not that surprised .
negative	steer_clear .
negative	i have used 0 different companies in the past and to be truthful anything would be better_than these people .
negative	just don_'_t do it !
negative	to be perfectly honest i have ordered from simply in the past and had no_problems but this company is now nothing but pathetic excuses and no action .
negative	i have the same history of order issues as other_reviewers on here i . e the status changing from ' priority dispatch ', ' waiting for courier ' and then on to ' backlog order '.
negative	in the end despite simply repeatedly thanking_me for my patience which by now was in very short supply , i cancelled the order and bought my lens elsewhere .
negative	now all that i can forgive as i should have researched them properly in the first place but the part where i am now waiting for them to take action on , ' a refund request has_been submitted .
negative	it will be processed asap ', is beyond a joke .
negative	i have been waiting for an entire week for them to refund my money , which they had no_problems debiting from my credit_card account straight_away .
negative	i have pointed_out to them that in the time it takes them to reply to my emails , a refund could simply have been processed .
negative	why on earth does it take them weeks to process a refund ??
negative	i have been informed ' normally the refund can take up to 0_weeks on occasion for the refund to be initiated due to current processes we have in place .
negative	with regards to your refund it has_been flagged for priority already so it will be processed as a soonest available opportunity .'
negative	......... why ?
negative	why on earth can '_t the refund take place straight_away ?
negative	you can ask simply these questions and all you will get is the same blanket statements without_any real or truthful explanations .
negative	i just want my money returned to my credit_card account but it would appear that i am actually going to have to lodge a complaint with my credit_card company to get anywhere .
negative	if you take your chances trying to buy from this company , you can '_t say nobody warned you !
negative	update !
negative	finally received my refund following daily emails to simply , perseverance paid off ....
negative	bought from them - within 0 hour had a few phone_calls and an_email asking thm if they can do anything etc - impression you got was that they would be faultless .
negative	i took entire day off work - i am self_employed as a tutor .
negative	day before i get a call and email_saying they cant deliver it - blaming the manufacturer .
negative	we reschedule to the following week and i ask them for a morning slot because i need to tutor students as alreayd have rearranged my diary once .
negative	was promised a morning delivery would happen .
negative	this morning i get a call at 0 am informing_me delivery wil be between 0 and 0pm .
negative	so sorry , but i cancelled the order .
negative	when i asked to be contacted back by sales by lunchtime today to confirm a refund would happen , was told not possible and it will now take 0 - 0 working_days for a refund .
negative	well this is also unacceptable - refunds do not take that long these days - i know i have my own business .
negative	quick to take your money , not quick to live up to expectation .
negative	so i hit them where it hurts - in their pocket .
negative	as my first and second reviews were deleted i thought i would repost them .
negative	i booked a cleaner for the 0th_april as i was on leave and hoped to get a one - off clean done .
negative	the cleaner was due to arrive at 0 : 00 .
negative	i got a call from mopp on the day to say she would now only be arriving at 00 : 00 .
negative	at 00 : 00 there was no sign of her and i then received a call from mopp to say that she was lost .
negative	the cleaner called me and said she had got so lost ( she only lives 0 miles_away from my home ) that she was now an_hour away .
negative	by 00 : 00 there was no sign of her so i called the company and asked where she was .
negative	they called me back and said they were unable to get_hold of her .
negative	i told them to leave it as i didn_'_t have time to wait .
negative	the gentleman apologised and asked me when i wanted to reschedule the cleaner for .
negative	i told him 00 : 00 on the 00th_april .
negative	he assured me this was booked .
negative	this morning ( 00th_april ) i got a call from a mopp employee who was obviously absent the day they taught customer service , to say that he was having_difficulty_getting me a cleaner .
negative	i told him i had been assured that one had been booked for me .
negative	he said ( and this is classic ) ' we only book them the day before !'
negative	i asked for the manager to call me back .
negative	she said she would attempt to find me a cleaner but 00_minutes later she called back to say there were none available !
negative	she said she would refund me and offered me a free clean in the future !!!!
negative	i wanted the cleaner they had promised me on both_occasions !
negative	no way will i ever use or recommend this company and i will make_sure that i spread the word !
negative	they are con - artists and i will be reporting them for false_advertising !!!
negative	!
negative	update_: i contacted one of the company '_s founders and he attempted to sort the problem out .
negative	i was guaranteed a cleaner today , 00th_april at 00 : 00 .
negative	i received an_email at 00 : 00 to say the cleaner had cancelled !
negative	if you are looking for empty shelves , out of date food , long_queues , poor management or shocking customer service then this is definitely the shop for you !
negative	after several fruitless emails to justin king , i have moved to another supermarket .
negative	this store is absolutely_disgraceful !
negative	never got my perscription and ordered 0_months_ago !
negative	had to start taking a new pill and am having many problems .
negative	will never order from this site again .
negative	made two transactions , paid via cc then to recieve a call to say that there is an extra_charge of over_$_000 !!
negative	was never mentioned on the website nor on the print out of both two confirmations !!
negative	then also get told that the car that was selected and paid for was not available .
negative	then .... looking at my bank_statements , i have 0 x $ 0 . 00 transactions on the 00 march_0000 by " traveljigsaw ".
negative	so i call rentalcars . com and they say that they charge $ 0 . 00 to see if ones credit_card works .
negative	well they charged me three_times !!
negative	i only had two transactions and why do they they charge a fee to see if your credit_card works ???
negative	if they put through the whole charge online it automatically gets approved via a financial institution does it not ???
negative	?
negative	disgusting way of doing_business .
negative	never again .
negative	my first review had to get my heart out !!!
negative	paid for 0 mb getting hardly 0mb .
negative	cannot even watch iplayer !!!
negative	avoid like plague asking for my money back
negative	i ordered a pushchair and adaptors from sobaby .
negative	when they overran the due delivery date i tried to contact them .
negative	it is impossible to get through on the phone , it just goes to a recorded_message , and they don_'_t answer email .
negative	i eventually put in a claim with my credit_card , and lo and behold about a week_later the stuff appeared .
negative	i would recommend not buying from this company , and if you do phone them first .
negative	i doubt you will get through .
negative	they then had the cheek to send me an_email_saying if i left a good review for them on the link they provided , they would send me a £ 0 gift voucher , which would be useless to me , because i have absolutely no_intention of buying from this company or their sister company bigimagination . co . uk .
negative	ever again .
negative	i ordered a summer bouquet for my friend , which should have been delivered by courier on friday .
negative	it didn_'_t arrive friday or saturday and i '_ve heard_nothing back from my complaint email .
negative	definitely won_'_t be using teleflorist again !
negative	ordered later on wed & paid premium for next_day delivery ( assuming that would be friday ) as gloves needed for weekend racing .
negative	first one email promising a delivery slot for friday midday , so stayed in ..... then second email promising late_afternoon delivery .
negative	amended plans to stay in .
negative	nothing .
negative	had to make rush shopping trip saturday_morning to buy gloves .
negative	delivery finally on monday midday , which we rejected as obviously not needed .
negative	no response from watersports_warehouse despite_emailing .
negative	not impressed !
negative	i have nothing to write and not very happy
negative	i ordered mats over a week_ago have not had any correspondence but they were quick to take the money !
negative	i phoned yesterday and was told that they would email me the tracking_number however still_waiting for the email !
negative	rubbish service rubbish company keep well away from them !
negative	the smeg fridge i ordered took several weeks before it was delivered .
negative	# it was not made clear that the goods were coming from germany .
negative	there is a problem with the firdge door which frequently does nit close .
negative	i would never use you again
negative	the two tops were more than 0_months late , i received no word as to when they would be ready or what was happening even_though i asked several_times .
negative	i am normally a very patient person but this was ridiculous .
negative	the only time they showed some interest in finding out where the tops were was when i wrote to cancel the order 0_months after_placing it , as i had given up any hope of ever seeing them and was starting to suspect that the company was fraudulent .
negative	they also offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery .
negative	also , i ended_up moving_house towards the end of the 0 month wait , and before i tried to cancel the order gave them a change of address so it wouldn_'_t be delivered to my old house it they were ever going to be delivered .
negative	i was informed that this was ok , but when they eventually decided to send the tops they ' forgot ' to change the address so i had to inform the shipping company myself , which was a massive hassle for everyone_involved .
negative	i will never ever come_back to your company and i thoroughly_recommend that no one else does too
negative	this ' company ' is shambolic .
negative	they took my money , didn_'_t email or contact me in any manner to confirm my booking and didn_'_t deliver the product i '_d ordered either .
negative	thank god i paid with paypal otherwise i '_d probably never have got my money back .
negative	they do not answer the phones or emails .
negative	this company has_been reported to trading_standards and with any luck they '_ll be forced to cease trading .
negative	never ever go_anywhere_near them .
negative	poor service did not follow or print my delivery instructions and parcel ended_up with a neibourgh we do not get on with and my elderly_dog needed it as its the only food she csn eat
negative	this was my first_impression of your company and ordered flowers for my mother in law who had just lost her mother and on her first day back at work i sent her these to tell her i was thinking of her !
negative	they didn_'_t arrive before she left at 0 :_00pm and they were apparently left in a secure_location at 0 :_00pm !
negative	firstly there is no secure_location as the building is locked and a colleague of hers went back to look and there were no flowers !
negative	so i '_ve spent £_00 and have no flowers !
negative	i would like someone to contact me about a refund as i am very upset !
negative	this company is impossible to contact by phone or e_- mail - you can not get through by phone and they do not respond to emails sent .
negative	i ordered a big_boy bean_bag for my daughter for christmas on 0 . 00 . 00 .
negative	it was advertised in the daily mail , and a voucher purchased from whopaysfullprice .
negative	it was due to be delivered in week 00 .
negative	it has not arrived .
negative	i '_m on maternity_leave and not in a financial position to go out and buy her another gift .
negative	i hope the owners of this company have a good christmas , because we certainly won_'_t .
negative	bah humbug !
negative	!
negative	the wrong medication was sent out from the prescription .
negative	this was a good job i checked it as the cat would not have survived taking it .
negative	when i rang up no apology was offered , i was told to post back the wrong tablets .
negative	i was then sent an_email that said i had put in a new order for the tablets and would be charged accordingly ( again a second time ).
negative	i had to email twice to rectify this and make the phone_call to alert the company .
negative	i am not satisfied at all with the service i have received for this purchase .
negative	the dispensing needs much tighter control .
negative	i should not be the purchaser that spots that wrong meds have been dispatched but the dispenser and another person at the company to check .
negative	shoddy and dangerous .
negative	still no apology has arrived .
negative	the meds i order are £_00 a month and are life saving .
negative	the wrong meds would have ended my cats life prematurely .
negative	not good enough .
negative	if i hadn_'_t got a prescription lodged with the company i would move elsewhere .
negative	tried to do all they asked , in order to register but the process was made practically_impossible .
negative	so i couldn_'_t be bothered in the end and cancelled the whole_thing .
negative	i bought a samsung neo phone from the ee shop 00 days ago .
negative	basically , the thing never worked .
negative	i never once managed to receive a phone_call on it .
negative	when i took it back to the shop and asked for a replacement or my money back , they refused .
negative	they said it was ' ee company policy ' not to replace phones !
negative	needless - to - say , this is not the end of it .
negative	i will merely contact my bank and tell them to backcharge ee .
negative	do they really think they get away with this crap ?
negative	maybe their management should visit the us and find out what customer service really is .
negative	this is a disgusting way to treat people .
negative	rang them to get a pac for my new phone to replace the one the ee shop sold me that never worked properly ( they refused to give me my money back ).
negative	so i called to get a pac_number for my new network_provider .
negative	they kept me hanging on at_least 00_mins , then the girl who replied was so rude .
negative	when i told her i didn_'_t like her attitude , she said she didn_'_t like mine either !
negative	unbelievable !!
negative	!
negative	i was disappointed to discover when my order arrived in the mail i was told i had to pay an extra_charge of 00 euro .
negative	i had no idea i would have to pay this and if i did i would not have order with ye .
negative	i could have got my products cheaper , very disappointed .
negative	it was never mentioned to me when i purchased on line or through email .
negative	disappointed !!!!!
negative	!
negative	wrong sizes for both outfits sent .
negative	disaster as only opened the packets on morning of the school event .
negative	wrong len '_s fitted so i am_currently_waiting to return the glasses to have them changed so i am able to see !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a few things for my friends birthday a week before her_birthday , and checked the delivery box which was 0st_class royal_mail , which said it should be delivered within 0 - 0_days , i thought that gave_me plenty of time honestly , now , exactly 0_days after i '_ve placed my order , the delivery still_hasn_'_t come , my friends birthday has passed and basically the customer service team couldn_'_t have been less helpful , a lot of " if it hasn_'_t arrived by such an such a date then we can declare it as lost ", that '_s not really good enough is it , especially when i paid_extra for it to arrive earlier !
negative	waste of time .
negative	paid £_000 for a pool less_than 0_months_ago and a hole has appeared on the bottom along the seam . they say that it is not a manufactures fault and won_'_t be taking my complaint any further . they still_haven_'_t bothered to contact me and from the picture i sent to them you can clearly see the hole is along the seam . i really can '_t see how they can say otherwise , their customer service is disgraceful
negative	i recently_purchased what i thought was a new product , but already it '_s been_discontinued .. grrrrrr !!!!!
negative	i thought the titan 0 was a new product but i can '_t get the parts for it and it '_s only been out a couple of months .
negative	my flowers did not get delivered because my mother was away .
negative	i had an_email letting_me know and asking me what i wanted to do which was great but then no one replied to my email and the number they provide to call for assistance didn_'_t work .
negative	absolute_waste of £_00 .
negative	happy to take your money but will not help you when the delivery does not go to plan .
negative	avoid .
negative	ring the local_florists direct .
negative	i chose lasek after_speaking to a friend working in eye laser in canada , i was in a lot of pain , more than she thought i would be , i am still - 0 . 00 /- 0 . 00 in both eyes .
negative	the lady at the clinic in cork said it will need to be redone , but they now have a better surgeon in cork and i won_'_t be in as much pain as he is better_than the guy in kildare .
negative	oh great , i paid thousands for dodgy eue surgery with a second rate surgeon .
negative	overcharged when booking a hotel room with them .
negative	tried_calling the dreadful customer_services team with no success , and they don_'_t answer emails .
negative	genuinely the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	mistakes can happen but it '_s expedia '_s utter lack of any sort of ' customer service ' and failure to resolve problems which makes them so dreadful .
negative	do not use .
negative	i popped down to see the bouquet , and was horrified at what i got for the money .
negative	i didn_'_t expect a large bunch , but these were no better_than a five_pound bunch from my local_store .
negative	the most upsetting problem is the flowers were in full_bloom , one day later , so won_'_t last more than a couple of days .
negative	i am assured the recipient did everything suggested on the card .
negative	i had decided to try a different supplier to interflora , but will never use this company again .
negative	the one thing in their favour was the constant_emails_keeping_me informed of delivery , which was excellent .
negative	sold this item after it was posted the buyer changed their mind .. after a fuss ebay decided the buyer was right and returned his money via_paypal the buyer had to post back ..
negative	i never received the item but as he had proof of posting i had no come_back !!!
negative	lost a very expensive mobile and had to pay all the sellers fees too !!!
negative	plus the cheeky man demanded £ 0 extra to post it back to me .
negative	a horrible_experience all_round not selling on ebay agian
negative	i had some tiles delivered today the driver was rude and abrupt had no manners . when you have a delivery and paid alot of money you expect service with a smile
negative	i am suppose to have successfully purchased 0 tickets to see the amazing marshall mathers aka eminem on the 00th_july .
negative	the money has_been debited and email confirmed purchase .
negative	time booked off work and i have been walking on air looking_forward to this event .
negative	given it '_s my wedding_anniversary the same day !
negative	however in light of the watchdog report i am very worried i do not actually have a ticket !
negative	please confirm if you are actually selling tickets or if i brought a potential resale which might not materialise .

negative	i bought a galaxy gear watch from expansys which had a fault with the strap .
negative	this was initially repaired directly with samsung as the expansys website advises you to go directly as this will be quicker .
negative	this too developed a fault and was clearly unfit for purpose , after negotiating with expansys for quite some time on how this would eb dealt_with i agreed for them to process another repair , with a replacement item being provided if this was unsuccessful .
negative	they have now had my watch for 0_weeks without_any sign of either the repair or a replacement .
negative	i have had to hound the company to find out what is happening , call not being returned emails ignored etc and even then it is not convincing that they are actually in control of the situation .
negative	i would never deal with company again and will be seeking_legal_advice soon if this is not resolved .
negative	having made my order on the 0th_sept to have it delivered on the 0th i was very disappointed that by the 00th_sept it had not been delivered .
negative	spoke to pixie the same day via live_chat and she promised that an upgraded bouquet would be sent on the next available delivery .
negative	this is now the 00st and still nothing .
negative	i have been told today that they will try to resend it .
negative	an_absolute_disgrace .
negative	to rub salt into the would i was offered a £_00 discount_voucher to be used on my next oreder .
negative	i will never ever use this company again .
negative	0 . 0_weeks since i made the order and now far too late for the special_occasion it was meant for .
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered on the 0th_october_0000 .
negative	my complaint has_been lodged with them and as yet i still have received no reply .
negative	in december_0000 we bought 0 tickets from viagogo for the monty python show ,( £_000 tickets cost us nearly_£_000 . 00 ) tickets arrived in january_0000 .
negative	in march we decided to sell our tickets as me and my husband were lose our jobs and listed our tickets on their website , viagogo collected the tickets , up till this point all was good .
negative	on the day of the show as we had not sold our tickets , decided to go see the show .
negative	we called customer_services and were left on hold for at_least half an_hour so we thought we will call again later , however yet again we were left on hold .
negative	so we looked on the website which said tickets can be collected from the inc club on the day of the event , however the email said at the conveniently_located collection_point .
negative	so we decided to make our way to the o0 and arrived at 0 . 00pm .
negative	the inc club was closed so we called customer_services from 0 . 00pm we were trying and each time we were left on hold for 00_minutes finally we got through at 0 . 00 and only to our shock were told our nearest_collection_point was victoria .
negative	by this time it was too late for us to pick the tickets up from victoria and return in time for the show .
negative	for this very poor customer service or shall i say lack of we will never use viagogo again .
negative	if viagogo sell tickets up to last_minute why would the collection_point be in victoria ?

negative	i ordered a scooter for my daughter '_s christmas_present last monday with fast 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	on friday , as the scooter had not arrived , i contacted cs who said they would raise the issue with yodel and promised me a reply by email .
negative	today they emailed to say that they have raised a query with yodel which will take 0 working_days to process .
negative	as christmas is saturday , leaving it 0_days for it still not to arrive is leaving it far too late .
negative	not only am i unlikely to receive the goods before christmas , the e_- mail says i can not get a refund or cancel the order until after the 0_days .
negative	is this legal as as far as i can see i have paid the money , but have no goods .
negative	is that theft ?
negative	i have ordered from pixmania in the past , but have this time been met with a couldn_'_t care less attitude .
negative	merry_christmas !
negative	order due for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 text_message and e_- mail to confirm , never arrived so phoned jjb on 00 / 0 / 00 was told they would check getting delivered 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	suprise , suprise never arrived now phoned on 0 / 0 / 00 told will try to cancel but need to trace parcel and recieve it back before i can get my money back ...
negative	i now have to trust hdml to find and return the parcel to jjb to get my money back !
negative	website kept_crashing and redirecting me baqck to the previous page
negative	this is the second time i '_ve order from here should have gone with someone_else knowing what they were like the first time .
negative	i was told my flowers would be delivered between 0 - 0 at 0 : 00 they rang me saying they didn_'_t have my flowers and they had rang around a few shops and they didn_'_t have either so they would make me up a new bunch of flowers didn_'_t say what just a ' nice bunch ' and then they didn_'_t arrive until 0 & 0 / 0 hours_later . the next time didn_'_t get any phone_calls was waiting all day ordered thursday to come friday they didn_'_t come until the next_day at 00am i recomend if you want what u order and on time go elsewhere as theses are not a reliable company as this is the second time its happened to me now .
negative	earlier i wrote to ebookers for enquiries and questions but did not get and response .
negative	i even booked a hotel from ebookers and did not get a good after sales services .
negative	so i had canceled my hotel_bookings from ebookers even_though i had to pay for the extra fees !
negative	i just can '_t believed that the service from ebooker is so bad .
negative	i used other agent booking and they returned with answer within 0 day !
negative	how do you expect a return customer with bad service ?
negative	did not receive the mattress i ordered .
negative	and when trying to arrange to sort it out , was told " no you have the one you ordered , they have changed the material ".
negative	no i didn_'_t i had a cheaper mattress , there was no quilted top to it completely_different colour and it also said on the plastic it came in what it was called , and another woman '_s name on it .
negative	i '_m stuck with a mattress i don_'_t want and still_waiting for my price difference .
negative	i will contacting_trading_standards over this as i have been completely ripped_off .
negative	would not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	i received a " large " bouquet through the post for my birthday from my husband .
negative	he had paid the extra to upgrade to a large size but when they turned_up they were a medium_size which he was very disappointed with .
negative	upon phoning customer_services they confirmed a medium had been sent but no apology given !
negative	they offered to refund the difference and that was all .
negative	the flowers were not very well_presented , a bunch of tulips with elastic round the bottom were plonked in the middle of the flowers , and not arranged how you would expect a £_00 bouquet to turn_up .
negative	overall , very poor quality flowers and very poor customer service .
negative	received the flowers 00st_may and roses have died before they had a chance to bloom .
negative	do not know how they have managed ti appear at top of search_engine .
negative	will definitely be sticking with interflora in the future .
negative	i ordered flower delivery 0_days in_advance of delivery date through eflorist for my aunt '_s 00th_birthday in ireland .
negative	the day of delivery i received an_email from them stating they could not find anyone to fulfil the order therefore it was cancelled .
negative	as i live in california it was impossible to make other arrangements for flower delivery that day .
negative	this company should have had the decency to let_me know sooner that they could not follow through with their end of our agreement .
negative	will never use eflorist again .
negative	this company has got to be the worst company ever , working for a company who used to regularly use yodel we had more calls for late equipment and non receipt of equipment than ever , after dropping the company we have had no such problems !
negative	scary staff they know everything about you !!
negative	!
negative	omg it took them 0_months and endless phone_calls to deliver the broadband box ,,,, no point to have fast broadband offer if your can '_t even deliver the router to your customers in reasonable time .... very bad customer service !!!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve never dealt_with such incompetence in my life !
negative	first , an order i made with a 00_%_discount_code was to be delivered by december 00th , which is great because i wanted it for christmas .
negative	oh !
negative	what '_s that you say ?
negative	your tracking_info won_'_t update and you can '_t locate your order ?
negative	oh - how convenient .
negative	so i contact customer service .
negative	they inform_me that there '_s a technical_issue with their tracking_system and assure me the order will be here by the 00th - the latest .
negative	oh !
negative	going on the 00th .
negative	so needless to say , i didn_'_t get this by christmas .
negative	but it gets better ...
negative	i figure , maybe i '_ll get it on the 00th , you know - because of the holidays , and they have a few more nice items i like , let_me get those .
negative	i '_ve dropped $_000 after this point .
negative	i select express shipping !
negative	i '_ll have something nice in time for new years_eve because it will be here by friday the latest .
negative	wonderful !
negative	i checkout and go on about my business .
negative	i noticed , however , that i didn_'_t get the dispatch email , so i check out my account on the 00th .
negative	standard shipping ?
negative	oh , ok . we ' re about this life .
negative	i contact customer service , thinking it '_s a website glitch and maybe they can fix it within the 0 hour time frame posted on their site .
negative	0 hours_later i get an_email_saying , i didn_'_t choose express shipping even_though i entered in the promo_code .
negative	so in turn my order won_'_t be here for a max 0 business days .
negative	oh , really ?
negative	you think so ?
negative	this in turn prompted my urbanista to come out full force , because there '_s nothing that pisses me off more than someone not taking accountability and then saying it '_s my fault .
negative	i go on a email rampage .
negative	i dig into this guy .
negative	at this point , i now know i '_m not getting my stuff so i just go h . a . m .
negative	it is what it is , so lets do this .
negative	0 hours_later i get another response telling_me that i didn_'_t receive express shipping not because i supposedly forgot to choose it at checkout , but because i used a 00_%_discount_code and i can '_t double codes up .
negative	what ?
negative	you mean the 00_% i used with my previous order ?
negative	now you guys are just being ig - nant .
negative	so again , i have to correct these people - stop pointing the finger , get your facts straight , and find my stuff .
negative	now i take it to facebook .
negative	i unleash my discontent on their wall and receive the generic " pm me so i can help you " response .
negative	ok , cool .
negative	lets play this game - i love games .
negative	i go through the motions again , explaining all the bullshit that '_s been happening .
negative	while i '_m doing this i get yet another email via asos .
negative	this time they tell me there is a technical_issue with my form of payment ( paypal ) which is why it did not take my request .
negative	but don_'_t worry they ' re working on it and here '_s 00_% and another express shipping coupon_code .
negative	oh !
negative	the coupon_code that won_'_t work , ergo our issue at hand ?
negative	brilliant !
negative	keep it up !
negative	i love it !
negative	how does that help me ?
negative	back to facebook .
negative	someone slips up and tells_me who the courier service is .
negative	oh !
negative	let_me contact them .
negative	i have to call back because the one person that handles asos is out of the office .
negative	how convenient .
negative	so , kids .
negative	$_000 later i have nothing .
negative	no packages , no dresses , nothing for nye , nothing for christmas ... zero !
negative	now that i '_m out of options - annoying these people is my current goal ( lack of funds being my motivation ) and will_continue to annoy them until someone gives me my merchandise or my money .
negative	and frankly all i want right now is my money !
negative	ordered my mep code for my curve 0000 , 0_days_later nothing .
negative	i have sent 0 e_-_mails and still no reply , my order number is # 00000 .
negative	very disappointed , wish i had of read the reviews before placing an order .
negative	feel scammed , the office of fair_trading should be aware of this company !
negative	!
negative	update_: i was going to give them a chance but after them ignoring all my e_-_mails which i sent to support , sales & payments i have now placed a dispute via_paypal people beware dont buy from these con men !
negative	!
negative	no way will i use this company again , slow at answering emails , no reply on the phone as its always engaged , flowers never arrived !
negative	not great !
negative	waited in all day till be told the courier had been and didnt have a up to date phone number for me or didnt have company phone !!
negative	updated my phone only other day to ensure delivery ..... couriers cant be bothered ringing customers too busy rushing round getting their drops in !!
negative	a total_waste of tme ended_up fetching it from depot in end !!
negative	!
negative	unless you have time to waste , waiting for a delivery that doesn_'_t come and phone_calls that are never returned , i wouldn_'_t recommend currys online .
negative	i had to chase the non - delivery every_step of the way to eventually get the goods i had paid for .
negative	one saving_grace was that they have given me a goodwill_gesture of a £_00 currys voucher .
negative	too little , too late , really - i won_'_t use them again .
negative	i ordered 0 oral - b compatible electric_toothbrush_heads and paid on 00th_may .
negative	i had my voucher_code - i ticked redeem .
negative	i then got an_email to say i had only 0_days left to redeem .
negative	on the website they gave_me , it stated the offer had ended .
negative	trying to contact them to get an answer is a nightmare .
negative	i have never used a website so complicated .
negative	i asked for my money back , but have not heard a word since .
negative	i ordered item and paid for it on 00 . 0 . 00 delivery 0 - 0_days .
negative	it is now 0 working_days and i still have not received it .
negative	the item was for a present for tomorrow so it is likely that i will have to buy from somewhere_else
negative	i received the dog_food quickly and promptly as always .
negative	there was a freebie christmas_stocking that arrived with the food .
negative	unfortunately they are trying to poison our dogs ... there was a pets inc . chocolate treat bar in the stocking with ingredients : wheat flour ( my dog is cereal free ), hydrogenated vegetable oil ( this is any good for any living thing ), vegetable oil , fat reduced cocoa_powder !!!
negative	( theobromine is toxic for dogs - there is no safe level , it is a poison for dogs )... i filled in contact forms on their site 0 times , no response .
negative	i emailed ... no response .
negative	i phoned and received very poor customer_care ... and i phoned again ... no apology ... now referred to manager ... and i will wait .
negative	this company doesn_'_t really hold any honesty or integrity , they tried to tell me they didn_'_t know what was in the stockings ... and the other treats were from china , no ingredients and i could see grain again .... and treats from china have been killing dogs in other parts of the world .
negative	i will not be purchasing from them again .
negative	i ordered glasses from smartbuyglasses . co . uk on 00th of january and i have still not received them .
negative	besides from the fact that someone on customer service offered me a discount as a compensation for long waiting but they charged me the full price , and my glasses haven_'_t still arrived !
negative	and no one is responding on my emails to customer service from 00 / 00 /_0000 !
negative	it '_s been almost a month and no one is informing_me about my order , moreover they are ignoring me !
negative	very rude !!
negative	!
negative	i am very disappointed !
negative	!
negative	and i wouldn_'_t recommend smartbuyglasses to anyone !
negative	i order labels for my daughter last_year and was very clear to inform that i needed them before school starts .
negative	i ordered them with plenty of time ahead .
negative	mine0sure misplaced my order and after a couple of weeks when i questioned it they resend the order but it was too late .
negative	they couldnt even offer sending it thru expedited mail so i could get it on time .
negative	they just didnt do anything for me to get them on time .
negative	at the end of the day i had to run to the office supplies store and make the labels on my own .
negative	i will never order from them again .
negative	hi ,
negative	not complaining_about price of tickets , it is easy to book online and have done so many_times .
negative	however i booked three tickets on friday_afternoon , and by my own mistake , i admit , i booked the ticket journeys the wrong way round !
negative	i realised immediately so i called the helpline number on the e_- ticket to see if there was anything i could do .
negative	i didnt think there would be , as i have booked with you before and i know that if it is an e_- ticket there is nothing you can really do if you mess it up !
negative	however , what i wasnt prepared for was the attitude of the woman on the end of the phone .
negative	her attitude really upset me and pretty_much told me it was my own fault ( yes , i was my own fault , but it '_s not ok for a customer service rep to say that ),
negative	she was very unsympathetic , and kept turning her phone onto mute which i thought was rude .
negative	after basically losing over_£_000 and her stinking attitude it ruined my evening and thanks to her attitude i will not be booking with you again .
negative	rude and incompetent .
negative	i worked in customer_services and have never_heard anyone speak to customers with such sarcasm and indifference .
negative	do not buy from here as you cannot cancel the order if it is incorrect or faulty .
negative	i am totally confused as to why you have sent me flowers ?
negative	please can you explain this as a matter of urgency .
negative	regards
negative	see the above comment as that says it all
negative	my partner and i bought contract mobile_phones on a cashback plan through buymobilephones . net in february_0000 .
negative	the phones arrived in good time and there were no apparent issues .
negative	the scheme was ' cashback by redemption ' meaning that we had to mail in our statements and a voucher every few_months ( with increasing regularity ) through the 0 year term of the contract .
negative	complicated and fiddly , but at the first claim date we diligently gathered together 0_months of statements and the vouchers and sent our packages off , awaiting a return of £_00 each .
negative	imagine our dismay when we heard absolutely nothing .
negative	on contacting the company we were asked whether we had used recorded mail .
negative	in their small_print they ' recommend ' using recorded mail and mysteriously , without it , * both * of our packages had gone_missing - despite_being sent separately , at different times from different post_offices .
negative	suspicious , much ??
negative	£_000 gone as we were now too late to claim again .
negative	so it was with some hesitation that we sent our next lot of statements and vouchers off - by recorded delivery .
negative	mine were returned because i had missed one of the statements .
negative	my partner '_s was paid in full , but when i returned all the correct statements i was only given a part payment - no explanation was ever offered .
negative	our third batch of statements has_been sent and we are awaiting our latest payments .
negative	an_email_confirmation of receipt from them is dated 0 / 0 / 00 but on 0 / 0 / 00 i am still_waiting to see if i am going to actually receive a payment from them , which can take ' up to 00 days .'
negative	i will * never * buy from this company again and have warned everyone - friends and enemies - to steer_clear .
negative	it is a scam company .
negative	they are incredibly dishonest and deceptive .
negative	the way that their ' cashback by redemption ' scheme is set_up is designed to prevent people claiming at every_step - the vouchers which , if lost , cannot be replaced , the fact that non - recorded mail goes in the shredder rather_than being_processed , the fact that they are so picky about which pages of your statements you send (" if in doubt , send the whole bill " - yeah , so i am going to send you my itemised , 00 page bill x 0 ?!
negative	i don_'_t think so !
negative	), the fact that they take so long to make a payment so that by the time you realise you haven_'_t been paid , or haven_'_t been paid in full , it is ' past the claim date ' and too late to do anything about it .
negative	all in all , a very nasty , dishonest company .
negative	learn from my mistake and find somewhere_else to buy your phone - it might look like a bargain but it '_s just an elaborate scam .
negative	i sent my phone off shortly_after receiving my upgrade , in january .
negative	it came back as just under_£_00 and i accidentally declined the offer .
negative	the phone got returned to me within a few_days so i promptly sent it back to get the same amount of money .
negative	then , months later , in june , i receive an e_- mail saying they had tested my phone and i was being offered £_00 .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of shoes , order accepted , confirmation emailed , but then the following_day i received and email to say 0 pair were not of good quality , so the entire order was cancelled !!
negative	i was given a 00_%_discount against future orders .
negative	i sourced 0 pairs of shoes from another source , however decided to use the discount to gain the 0th .
negative	was very sceptical_about their arrival , however they were delivered and i am happy with them .
negative	however my overall experience this time ( considering i have used rubbersole for the last 0_yrs ), has not been good , therefore i would not use them again nor recommend them .
negative	shabby customer service , i '_m afraid .
negative	i ordered a pre_- release mug in time for christmas .
negative	a fortnight before christmas it was delayed until after new year .
negative	then it was canned altogether .
negative	pathetic !
negative	i also ordered a boxed game for my nephew as it was the cheapest available at play .
negative	when it arrived , it was all bashed and not in a fit state to give as a present .
negative	the company gave_me a refund minus postage .
negative	i emailed the company and apart_from an auto_reply ( that i should receive a response within 00_hours ), never_heard from them .
negative	when i rang up to complain that i '_d wanted a replacement , they said i could order it from their web_site , but the price had tripled , so it was no_longer competitive .
negative	after a bit of discussion they agreed to refund my postage .
negative	however , i ended_up buying the product elsewhere .
negative	as a result of these experiences , i will not do_business with play . com again .
negative	do not buy from figleaves ... i ordered 0 bikini tops to be sure i got the right size .
negative	i returned one unworn , still with tags within 00_hours ... to be told by them it was marked and i couldn_'_t have a refund ... what the heck there was no mark it was brand_new ... awful company refusing to honour their terms and conditions ... i will never buy from them again and wished i '_d checked other review sites before buying a lot of people are having problems with figleaves .. don_'_t buy from them terrible customer service !
negative	i decided to move from sky to talktalk a few_months_ago from sky .
negative	worst decision ever !!!!
negative	the internet is lagging as is the tv guide interface .
negative	using multiple devices connected to the internet is slow to the point of being almost unusable .
negative	so when i decided to move home i checked the cost of cancelling my contract £_000 . 00 not the kind of money most people have to throw_away .
negative	so begrudgingly i starting arranging to move the services over to my new home only to find that i would be renewing the 00 month minimum contract something i did not want to do .
negative	so i rang talktalk and was told i could transfer my contract to someone_else ( i '_m not lumbering someone_else with this rubbish ) pay the extortionate cancellation_fee in a lump_sum that would be taken from my account or put up and shut up and get on with another 00 months of this garbage .
negative	fantastic :-/ i would advise to never join talktalk !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	we have not had a problem until last_week this is why now i am so shocked at interparcels customer service .
negative	our company booked this order to be collected and delivered last_week we have to give them a ref to quote on collection to release items , interparcel said ' yes we will do this and tell the drivers to quote the ref ', this however failed so we re booked same thing happened so re book and so on until they failed yet again .
negative	today i called interparcel as we are fed_up with the failed collection and they said i quote ' it is not guaranteed that the driver will quote the ref although we scan these instructions to them ' ...
negative	but they failed to mention this when we paid for that particular service .....
negative	it was ' yes we can do that !'
negative	do not use interparcel ..
negative	this has happened to another order of ours again !!!
negative	tip_: interparcel should look after their long_term customers and do not be so rude when we have a problem !
negative	i '_m sorry to say my sister did not receive her_birthday flowers for some reason yesterday .
negative	she said she was out at 0pm yesterday so we are not sure_whether they were delivered to the wrong_address or whether they were taken from the step .
negative	she_lives at flat 00 the orchard in a sheltered_accommodation area .
negative	there is also a no 00 orchard house in the same street , so she is going to go round there today to see if they had them delivered there by mistake .
negative	i '_m_sure it is a misunderstanding , but it is a shame she didn_'_t get her flowers on her_birthday .
negative	order not delivered !
negative	no reply to e_-_mails and it would appear that the contact telephone_number has_been disconnected !
negative	i am now in the process of contacting the trading_standards authority .
negative	have tried all day to contact iflorist , to no_avail !
negative	i have also been ' blocked ' by them on facebook , presumably because i had the audacity to post that i hadn_'_t received my order and was considering contacting_trading_standards .
negative	i see you have replied to some of the reviews on here iflorist and wondered_if you would be courteous enough to do the same for me as i have exhausted every other method of trying to make contact with you !
negative	many_thanks !
negative	i ordered a manual for a cooker - i received a call to confirm the price would be £_00 + postage ( approx 00 . 00 ) in total - when it arrived over a weeklater , it was a photocopy and not the original manual !!!
negative	outrageous price for 0 pages of photocopied paper ( both_sides granted ...)
negative	i '_m sorry , i know every company has the right to reply to the review , but if they dare , even dare here !
negative	when their so - called customer service has_been so poor ?
negative	let them even try !
negative	garden_buildings direct .
negative	well .
negative	i don_'_t normally post bad_reviews .
negative	poo happens , every company has an off day , so i like to give the benefit of the doubt .
negative	however .
negative	this company took the biscuit .
negative	biscuit isn_'_t the word i would normally use .
negative	think , a four letter word starting with ' p ' describing urine , and ending in ' iss '.
negative	however , i don_'_t know if there '_s any issue with profanities on your site , so i '_ll err on the side of caution .
negative	a rather lengthy story , but i think it warrants telling .
negative	order from them at your_peril .
negative	as i write this , i am looking at their website , specifically our product and i see ' mrs x just bought this product ' and ' 00 people are viewing this product at the moment ' and i wish i could reach out to each and every one of them individually and tell them to run screaming in the opposite_direction .
negative	if you ever phone them ... while you wait , they play a michael_buble cd on a loop ?
negative	we '_ve come to the conclusion now , that they play this in an attempt to calm people down , you know , like musical valium , for those who are , most_likely , in that queue , phoning up to complain ?
negative	no offence michael .
negative	or michael fans .
negative	handy hint gbd – try enya ?
negative	or loreena mckennitt ?
negative	they ' re good too .
negative	just for a bit of rotation , so we customers feel like you ' re actually a * sed ?
negative	my husband has wanted a summerhouse for years .
negative	we decided that this year we wouldn_'_t have a holiday and instead save for home and garden improvements .
negative	on the 0th_june , we were looking online at summerhouses on garden_buildings direct .
negative	we saw a lovely 00 foot by 00 foot one , and we put our postcode in on their website , and it said ' we can deliver to you on the 00th_june '.
negative	we decided to sleep on it .
negative	in the morning , we decided to go_ahead and purchase it .
negative	again , we put our postcode in and it said then ' we can deliver to you on the 00th_june '.
negative	ten working_days .
negative	fine – we thought .
negative	we had our 00th_anniversary party coming up on the 00th_june , this gave_us a clear week to get it stained , erected .
negative	we had a garden party planned , as our house is quite small , and this would provide some extra room or shelter if the weather was bad .
negative	with the floor , the order total was over_£_000 .
negative	i had a ' welcome ' email from them , and then a confirmation_email .
negative	in this email , they claimed ...
negative	“ we will keep you updated with the status of your order throughout , so there is no need to contact us .
negative	we pride ourselves on our clear communication so don_'_t worry if you get plenty of emails from us letting you know how your order is coming along ”
negative	plenty ?
negative	er ... we heard_nothing from them about how our order was progressing , so we assumed , seeing as we hadn_'_t been told it was being delayed , that friday 00th_june was go .
negative	so , my husband took a day '_s holiday from work .
negative	he phoned in the afternoon .
negative	' where '_s my summerhouse ?'.
negative	well it emerges , that it was about to leave them ( what ???
negative	), to go into pre_- something or other , pre_- delivery , pre_- despatch .
negative	in the next couple of days .
negative	and then ... it would be another 0 – 0 working_days .
negative	because – you see – they don_'_t deliver to our area often !
negative	but seemingly had no_qualms in taking the money from someone_who_lives in my area !
negative	can i just point out here that we live in north_wales .
negative	not the outer_hebrides .
negative	we are an_hour from chester , direct on the a00 .
negative	which is a dual carriageway , all the way .
negative	no dirt tracks , no sharing roads with sheep or tractors .
negative	no ferries needed .
negative	no tolls .
negative	and as wikipedia puts it , a major british road .
negative	major .
negative	not good enough .
negative	my husband pointed_out that if this went off late next week , and took 0 working_days , we '_d be pushing four_weeks from ordering .
negative	plus we have our party on friday .
negative	so off went the lady we spoke to and she came back , and said we will refund you £_00 as a goodwill_gesture , and we can deliver it to you on wednesday .
negative	we took a few_minutes to confer and decided , yes , this would be ok . not ideal , but do - able .
negative	at a push .
negative	this is definitely coming wednesday ?
negative	yes .
negative	so we ask for email_confirmation .
negative	tuesday comes and something is niggling away at me .
negative	gut_feeling .
negative	i check my emails and i see that i have an_email_confirming that £_00 has_been put onto my debit_card .
negative	but no email_confirming that it '_s coming tomorrow .
negative	so i emailed their sales_department , and after about an_hour and a half , i asked my husband to phone .
negative	just to check if it really was coming .
negative	as he '_d taken another day holiday off work .
negative	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand guess_what .
negative	no .
negative	it '_s not coming tomorrow , it '_s coming thursday .
negative	wow .
negative	i thought he was apoplectic then , but bear with , it gets better !
negative	wednesday comes .
negative	and just for a laugh , because i '_m sadistic like that ...
negative	i said to hubby , phone them up , and ask them if they know when the summerhouse is being delivered .
negative	so he phones up , in his nicest , happiest voice .
negative	and he was told that it was about to go to pre_- despatch , pre_- delivery what the eff ever they call it .
negative	and then it would go to a holding bay ... and then !
negative	then !
negative	it would be delivered and she estimated ... drum roll
negative	the 0th of july .
negative	july , yes .
negative	july .
negative	my husband is northern , so just think peter kay getting wound up .
negative	you still with me ?
negative	laughing ?
negative	' it best bl_** dy not be !'
negative	off she goes , and no , it is being delivered on thursday .
negative	so he asks , can we have that in an_email , please .
negative	which – to their credit , we received .
negative	delivered between ( typically !)
negative	0 am and 0 pm .
negative	so , i am woman , so i set my alarm for ten to six , because i say sod '_s law ...
negative	at 0 . 00_pm the courier comes .
negative	nice_chap .
negative	he finally loads it onto the massive pallet and drops it on the road .
negative	he pointed_out that the board is damaged in two places , significantly damaged too , a good 0 – 0 inch corner cut_off .
negative	i noted it – wasn_'_t his problem .
negative	he merely delivered it , it wasn_'_t his company providing it .
negative	so , as quickly as possible , as we ' re on a bus route , we unload the pallet , carry it through the house to the back garden .
negative	then the fun and games begin !
negative	we check all the wooden pieces .
negative	everything seems to be in order .
negative	but my husband is scratching his head at these boards .
negative	so , we think – the roof and the floor must be the same material .
negative	so we measure them all , and i go off inside like statto to work out how they can feasibly do a roof and a floor , all the while my heart sinking because , i just know .
negative	our friend comes round and he , with a clear , unhindered head , sets it all out , and he says – ' its all the roof .
negative	all of it .
negative	you have no floor .'
negative	now , this not being a floor that came with the summerhouse .
negative	oh no .
negative	this being a £_000 floor , that we paid_extra for .
negative	' give me that bl_** dy phone '.
negative	you '_d think my husband would be apoplectic by this point .
negative	no .
negative	twas when he spoke to the lady on the phone , who didn_'_t have the best english , was obviously just there to answer calls , not to resolve_issues any further than ' it will be with you as soon as possible ' and i don_'_t mean any offence by that .
negative	my husband veered from angry to respectful and pointed_out several_times to the lady that he wasn_'_t getting on to her , but .
negative	but .
negative	please put him on to someone_who could give him yes and no answers .
negative	after being told to hold two or three_times , and put back on to this same poor woman , i think all the supervisors and managers were on a tea break / dinner break / meeting / in the toilet , it was then that he had horrors , and he finally spoke to some bloke called j ****.
negative	my husband told him that they either had a floor here tomorrow , next_day delivery ( which they offer , incidentally , don_'_t take them up on it , because their £_00 . 00 standard delivery doesn_'_t do what it says on the tin !
negative	unless , maybe , you live in the midlands and they hand ball it to you !)
negative	or , the other option was , £_000 – in cash , not refunded by debit_card , and us having to wait 0 – 0 working_days , but in cash , in our account , at the nearest barclays , by 00 am tomorrow morning .
negative	so we could try and source something from elsewhere .
negative	and then attempt , laughably , to build a 00 by 00 summerhouse before a 0pm party .
negative	and then enjoy it .
negative	happy bl_** dy anniversary !
negative	to listen to him , he was like lancashire mafia , holding someone hostage .
negative	' i want £_000 , in my account , by 00 am tomorrow morning .'
negative	i wanted to laugh but i didn_'_t ?
negative	i was in a quandary ?
negative	anyway .
negative	j wasn_'_t sure if this could be done so he said he would have a word with ' finance ' and could he phone hubs back in 0 – 00 .
negative	at this point , husband had been on for over three_quarters of an_hour insisting on speaking to someone in charge .
negative	j **** probably wasn_'_t any more in charge than the girl he initially spoke to .
negative	we think garden_buildings direct '_s customer service smells of ' call_centre '.
negative	which is ok , it '_s fine .
negative	everyone has to earn a living .
negative	however , when it comes to continuity of customer service ...?
negative	it has to be said however , in all fairness he did phone back .
negative	he told my husband that it was too late to deposit cash in for immediate clearance , plus banks were nearly shut ( in his defence , correct ) but that he personally was in at 0 am the next_day , and would do his best to sort it out .
negative	and that '_s where we ' re at .
negative	limbo .
negative	00_hours before what was going to be a wonderful evening with family and friends , and my garden looks like ...
negative	so .
negative	benefit of the doubt once , yes .
negative	as i said to them in my initial email , an estimated delivery time of 00 working_days , i understand the meaning of the word ' estimated '.
negative	however , as paying customers , the onus is on them , i would say , to let the customer know if this is to be exceeded ?
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	welcome email , confirmation_email , then – nada .
negative	they then lied to us , causing my husband to lose another day '_s holiday .
negative	we have four children , three of whom are on the autistic spectrum , not only is holiday time precious for them to spend time with their dad , but i also need his time to help me when they are at home ?!
negative	not wasted sat around looking at each other , waiting for something that isn_'_t going to materialise .
negative	i don_'_t think it '_s on .
negative	sorry for lengthy review .
negative	that '_s where we ' re at .
negative	if there '_s no account movement in the morning , then we ' re going for a full_refund .
negative	at the end of the day , they had fourteen days , working_days or not , to get this order right .
negative	and then !
negative	then !
negative	they had an extra five .
negative	we can see by the labels on the parts when this order was actually processed , gbd !
negative	yeah !
negative	# notstupid
negative	caveat emptor , as i was taught when i studied law .
negative	those big companies like b_& q and homebase might be generic , but .
negative	at_least you know you can get somewhere with them .
negative	i always liked to support the ' little ' guy , because i had a business once myself and i know how hard it is .
negative	but jesus christ on a bike .
negative	never , ever again .
negative	and i hope you don_'_t either .
negative	or at the very least – if you want it in a hurry , for a specific reason , for a specific date ?
negative	don_'_t .
negative	thanks , if you made it this far .
negative	ordered a £_00 bouquet which arrived virtually dead and the ' handwritten_note ' scrawled on a piece of cardboard , after emailing them i received a response asking for a photo .
negative	after sending this and 0 emails later still no reply .
negative	absolutely awful service and awful flowers !
negative	most were green_foliage !
negative	i highly advise anyone considering this company to think again !
negative	i '_ve seen healthier , fuller bouquets in service stations !
negative	over priced and utterly awful customer service .
negative	0_weeks before our holiday they emailed to say accomodation was no_longer available .
negative	trying to get back the deposit has_been a nightmare .
negative	i would strongly_recommend that you look elsewhere to book your holiday .
negative	£_00 a month for years then no heating or hot_water yesterday so i rang them to arrange a call - out .
negative	despite having an 0 month_old baby in the house i was told to wait for over a week before an engineer could fix the problem .
negative	nothing else to add ...... this speaks for itself
negative	have investigated company director - he has_been involved with many other_companies - all registered addresses dont exist - like so many others - never refunded
negative	we bought a new build and fu were forced upon us as the developer chose them .... stupidly .
negative	after months we finally got an account ,( our neighbour is still wating after 0yrs ) and they have taken erratic amounts monthly based on our brand_new smart_meter .
negative	the bills are much higher than other_suppliers quotes so we tried to leave and they had us bound by a contract that the builder took out , but 0 years on we really need to get_rid of fu due to high pricing and bad service .
negative	on trying to switch they have produced an £ 0000 bill after we have paid every_month and they now claim the meter never worked ... what and you never thought to tell us , and why was it irractic amounts which were dressed_up to look like it was an actual reading ?
negative	i am bracing myself for a long struggle to sort this out because you just know its not going to be easy , i wish we had switched on moving in and swallowed a leaving fee because we would probably have saved time and money .
negative	if you are thinking of using them then expect the worst and you will not be disappointed .
negative	products were fine , but price did not make the terrible customer service experience worthy
negative	i bought a cot_mattress for my for my 0 month_old .
negative	it was for her move from moses_basket to cot .
negative	initially amazing lead time for delivery , ordered pm late dec and received am next_day , a lead time that i wasnt_expecting this time of year .
negative	when i received nursery connections sleepyhead spring interior cot_mattress , it was faulty , this is what i emailed ,
negative	i must_say that it was an incredibly efficient service as i received the goods less_than 00hrs after ordering .
negative	heres where my satisfaction ends , the mattress itself is of very poor quality the foam covering doesnt fit the mattress , this may be due to the mattress not being the advertsied size of 000cmx00cm it is far shorter @ best being 000cm but it is not of uniform shape ( not completely rectangular ).
negative	i would not expect this kind of inferior quality being sold by your establishment and i wouldnt expect a dog to sleep on this mattress let_alone my three month_old daughter .
negative	this was their response on the 00 jan , on me returning the item .
negative	" thank_you for choosing precious_little one , this is a confirmation_email that we have recieved your item back and a refund will be issued accordingly minus £_00 . 00 .
negative	we have inspected the item and the dimensions of the mattress are in_accordance with our website and the cover does protect the whole mattress therefore returns charges are applicable .
negative	please bear in mind that once a refund has_been issued it can take up to 0 working_days for the transaction to show on your statement .
negative	if you have any further questions we will be happy to help you ."
negative	i argued the point and stated the distant selling laws , but was met with , thats it take it or leave it .
negative	neither i was not prepared to accept .
negative	i then brought out the big guns .
negative	i took photos of the product before returning the item , call me suspicious .
negative	these were greeted with dismissal and forwarding to the manufacturer , my response as follows ,
negative	as you can appreciate , i am not a professional_photographer , that aside the photographs are a true_representation of the mattress that i received , whether the manufacturer says that this is a fault or not under the sale of goods_act 0000 i am entitled to a full re - imbursement due to the product being i feel not as_described as certainly not of satisfactory quality .
negative	it is irelavant what the manufacturer says because they may be happy to produce this kind of quality as acceptable .
negative	i still cannot_believe that you are questioning that this product is faulty and surely if you run a baby_equipment business selling products of this quality should cause you serious concern , not fight to protect this product .
negative	at the end of the day if your business sells this kind of quality and finds it acceptable , then it would appear that you are not considering the happiness of your customer and if this is the kind of product that you are prepared to endorse and stock then this will create the image and integrety that your business will portray publicly .
negative	i also got in touch with trading_standards about miss advertising and ultimately with a couple more emails , i was fully refunded .
negative	you have been warned beware !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered & paid for a vax vacuum on 00st_may for delivery in 0 - 0_days - did not receive it so i eventually got through to customer service .
negative	i was promised that the vacuum would be sent by next_day delivery - still not arrived six days_later .
negative	i have made endless calls to them but they will not tell me whether the vacuum is in stock or not .
negative	i suspect that they will not admit it is out of stock because they have taken payment from my credit_card - i don_'_t think they should do this under the terms of " remote selling ".
negative	i could have bought this last_week £_00 cheaper direct from vax in their one day sale , but i thought i had an agreement with curry '_s & would receive the vacuum by last thursday .
negative	i am going to ask for my money back , plus compensation for phone_calls & wasted time .
negative	be warned - curry '_s don_'_t care .
negative	i ordered a bouquet for a friend '_s birthday which was supposed to consist of white_roses and purple freesias and paid_extra to include a further 00 %.
negative	it looked lovely on the website but when it arrived my friend sent me a picture and it actually only contained the white_roses and didn_'_t look very special at all .
negative	i contacted e_- florist and did receive an initial response stating that they hadn_'_t realised that there had been a problem with the freesias from their supplier and that they had decided to go_ahead and send the bouquet without them .
negative	they offered to resend a new bouquet or offered a partial_refund .
negative	i responded to advise that as the birthday had passed their seemed little point in resending the flowers and enquired as to the value of the refund .
negative	i sent this message on the 0th_july , sent it again on the 00th_july when i received no response and then also sent a further message through the enquiry form on the website just to ensure that there was no way it could have been missed .
negative	unsurprisingly i have still not had a response .
negative	i am completely dissatisfied with the overall experience .
negative	eflorist may be slightly cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
negative	i would not use this company again and would warn friends that were thinking of doing so .
negative	i put in two orders - one for my mother and one for my mother - in - law .
negative	i only got an_email_confirmation for one of the orders .
negative	i contacted_iflorist and they said i had only made one order and i should put in another order .
negative	i disagreed but they were very firm .
negative	i nearly made another order but at the last_minute i said no .
negative	i called my bank who confirmed i had put through 0 orders .
negative	i called iflorist back and told <_name_removed_> and just laughed and laughed .
negative	i said it wasn_'_t funny because they have lost my order and nearly took a third order off me .
negative	and to top it all - the wrong flowers turned_up !
negative	!
negative	i am_disgusted to see the number of people selling really good seats for chrissie hynde at the rfh at extortionate prices when the true fans had to spend_ages hanging on yesterday only to get dud seats in the rear stalls .
negative	it '_s a disgrace that you are enabling ticket_touts in this way
negative	shocking service - flowers arrived 0_days after dispatch - totally dead .
negative	when i contacted customer service on their online service i was ignored for 0 hour , i then contacted again via online_chat and this time it took them 0hour 00 mns to actually listen to me - they kept asking for the order number and other details which i had already told them and they really didnt care - got the impression that they just thought i would give up and go away .
negative	i didn_'_t and after 0 hour 00_mins they agreed to send another bouquet - however it has not been received !
negative	dont really know what to do next as they dont care .
negative	please do not use this company - shocking service
negative	delivering flowers is a big responsibility .
negative	there are friendships and relationships riding on it .
negative	and in this case , serenata completely failed to live up to the task .
negative	having paid a lot of money for two big bunches , i was horrified to find that neither arrived on the delivery day .
negative	i received two dispatched texts at midday , then nothing more .
negative	no updates , no apology , nothing .
negative	both bouquets were for workplaces , which obviously wouldn_'_t have people there in the middle of the night .
negative	not to mention the fact that my friends didn_'_t get the flowers i '_d sent .
negative	when i contacted serenata , i got the most robotic , inhuman responses i '_ve ever_seen from a brand .
negative	this isn_'_t a corporate bank or law firm - flowers are a personal , human thing .
negative	so to get a reply from a machine is totally_unacceptable .
negative	i am still_waiting to hear what happened .
negative	serenata haven_'_t told me , and when i asked about a refund they simply pointed me to terms and conditions which say flowers can be delivered until_0pm .
negative	my flowers did not arrive before 0pm , but still , there '_s been no acknowledgement or apology .
negative	shockingly_bad service .
negative	serenata - you should be ashamed .
negative	i reviewed this sham of a company a while ago but was promised they would try their best to get me my tickets !
negative	i am still_waiting and have heard_nothing more than empty_promises and the concert is tonight !!
negative	( transaction_id_0000000 ) since this seems to be the only way to get a response from them i would like to hear something other than the generic_response that is pasted onto each bad_review on here .
negative	i bought these tickets as part of my daughter '_s christmas and now she isn_'_t getting to go and i am very out of pocket !
negative	this whole site seems like some kind of scam / fraud !
negative	!
negative	i have been given the run around on the new car i bought from stoneacre harrogate .
negative	the day i bought it , i noticed the cd_player wasn_'_t working and contacted them immediately .
negative	i took the car back a few_days_later so that their services department could find out the problem and after an_hour they told me that they would have to order a new one - full of apologies .
negative	over a week went by and i hadn_'_t heard a thing , so i called them and was informed that it was under manufacturers_warranty , so i had to take it to a vauxhall dealership and they would replace it free of charge .
negative	i did as stoneacre told me to .
negative	the vauxhall garage pulled_out the cd_player , noticed something stuck inside it and pulled_out the object .
negative	all in all it took them 00_minutes to fix the problem but they charged a small sum because it wasn_'_t a manufacture fault .
negative	reported back to stoneacre who refuse to foot the bill because apparently the vauxhall garage had no right to fix the cd_player .
negative	does stoneacre expect the vauxhall garage to replace the offending item to make the cd_player not work again ?
negative	this company took my money , but never sent my order .
negative	i tried_emailing them and phoning them for months .
negative	apparently it is run by praba thevathasan and francis sathish babu ( who also runs it jack ).
negative	but i was never able to get_hold of either of these people , so i after 0_months i have lost my £_000 .
negative	i purchased the super hooded parka jacket ... my partner bought me this for christmas in a size medium ( size00 ) as i am a size 00 / 00 and i could not move in the jacket at all ...
negative	i returned the jacket to the shop and got a refund so i could purchase a size large from the website and when i received the size large ( size 00 ) it was no better !
negative	not happy as i have 0 superdry_jackets and this one has_been the worse !
negative	obviously they have a sizing issue which needs to be looked at !
negative	i ordered flowers ( symapthy flowers due to bereavement ) for a same day delivery but i received a call later in the day saying that they were unable to find a florist within a certain radius to deliver the flowers .
negative	the lady on the phone said that for the price that i paid for same delivery they would make up in flowers instead for them to be delivered the next_day .
negative	i was very disappointed .
negative	i have used eflorist .
negative	a number of times previously and now due to this experience doesnt may me want to use eflorist again .
negative	also , disappointed as i wanted the flowers with it being due to an_unexpected death being delivered the same day .
negative	flowers were disgusting for the price paid .
negative	not fresh and long_lasting at all , very poor quality , various buds did not open and flowers were dying off after two_days ,
negative	very very disappointing , will not use this business at all in the future .
negative	some sort of compensation would be nice as they were a christmas_present for my elderly_parents .
negative	dawn barnes
negative	was sent broken and packaging was awful .
negative	smells nothing like the real perfume
negative	i ordered a bouquet for my mother - in - law '_s birthday .
negative	upon_receipt she called to thank us for the flowers but also said that the flowers arrived wilted and the packaging damaged .
negative	she said they looked old .
negative	we are not happy at all with the service that we have received .
negative	a set of watercolour brushes was ordered from saa for my birthday by my husband .
negative	we have had to wait one month for half the brushes to arrive ( long past said birthday !)
negative	when i rang to complain today , saa said that they get frustrated with their suppliers .
negative	i am the one still_waiting for the remainder of the brushes and they have had full payment for all that time .
negative	only_thing that saa suggested was that i return the brushes and await a full_refund .
negative	not very satisfactory .
negative	poor service saa !
negative	i '_m tired of this company '_s broken_promises .
negative	every delivery date promised is not fulfilled and they are just incompetent .
negative	no - one knows anything and they can '_t find the products in their system either .
negative	ordered a chiminea for a birthday_present from this company on the 0 june_0000 , had a choice to select a delivery day so chose friday 0 june .
negative	was pleased as it was a competitive price and would turn_up before my daughter '_s birthday on the 00 june .
negative	received a confirmation_email_stating the delivery date of the 0 june along with another tracking email .
negative	this tracking email just said from the start to this end of this sorry saga " awaiting shipping ".
negative	of course the chiminea didn_'_t arrive , we rang customers services but could never get through , sent emails that were never answered .
negative	eventually yesterday morning we rang at 0am and spoke to a very pleasant lady in sales ( customer_services don_'_t open until 0am ).
negative	she couldn_'_t help but said she would put a fast track on our email to try sort it out .
negative	got a voice message on mobile late_afternoon apologising for the delay and saying that they would send one out straight_away and it would arrive between_0am and 0pm today .
negative	we have just had another call from them at 0 . 00 this afternoon saying that it wasn_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be getting any more until end of month !
negative	we have asked for a refund .
negative	but what a waste of everyone '_s time and what terrible customer service .
negative	i will certainly not be dealing_with worldstores again
negative	first things first .
negative	the shoes are the quality and style that you would expect from ecco , very pleased with them - so definitely a 0_star product .
negative	but actually receiving my shoes bordered on the farcical .
negative	when i was tracking the parcel to my surprise i found on the delivery company website the shoes had been delivered .
negative	this was news to me as no card was left .
negative	i emailed both the delivery company and ecco about this .
negative	no response at all from the delivery company .
negative	ecco did respond and told me that they were at a parcel_force depot and i should contact them .
negative	i duly did this , and gave parcel_force the tracking_number provided by ecco .
negative	this was not recognised by parcel_force .
negative	so yet another email to ecco , who told me that they were sorry i had not found my shoes and gave_me the correct tracking_number .
negative	yet another phone_call to parcel_force to find that my shoes were with a neighbour .
negative	i have to say i found this experience really frustrating .
negative	ecco , told me that they have heard similar complaints about cards not being left by the delivery company . had they provided the correct tracking code from the start , i would have found my shoes a lot quicker .
negative	they offered me an online discount_code ( but didn_'_t tell me the value !)
negative	after i had told them i would not be using their online shop again !
negative	i would buy ecco_shoes again , but not from the website .
negative	twice i wrote and asked if my order had been delievered , as i didnt want to ask the reciipient as the gift was a surprise , and im still_waiting for an answer i have now heard from my family that the order did arrive .
negative	but for 0_days there i didnt know for sure but rest_assured i will not use your company again ,
negative	regards margaret reene
negative	after lengthy waits the girl was unable to book my crossing she said because my vehicle at 0 . 0 metres was too high .
negative	i told her it had squeezed in before but she said no , her computer did not accept vehicles beyond 0 metres in height .
negative	i gave up and booked it myself on line where it does accept my vehicle , it also costs £_00 less . the only problem is i could not choose the type of ticket and got the saver one .
negative	hope we make it in time .
negative	your star system is silly it expects there to have been friction .
negative	there was none .
negative	just the clerk needed better training .
negative	i would rather give no stars but then you would not get my review .
negative	i was once an_avid customer of maplin , but i then realised many of the products i had purchased from them were just not giving a good life span .
negative	my last purchase was two solar panels at about £_000 each , which should have produced a combined 0 amp output .
negative	alas , they struggled to give 0 . 0 amps in the brightest of conditions so i complained to them .
negative	they would not do anything so i complained to the manufacturer who replaced the panels .
negative	unfortunately , even these panels did not produce their full output as specified , but more_importantly the construction was such that when water entered one of the so - called sealed panels it shorted its internal electronics , which in turn shorted the battery bank of three batteries it was charging , completely destroying their charging capability .
negative	i did then contact the managing_director of maplin , but even he could not be bothered to reply , so i stopped dealing_with the company , also redirecting all the educational orders i once forwarded to them .
negative	in my experience maplin just don_'_t seem to care that much about the customer or customer_satisfaction , so in my book they do not even really warrant one star .
negative	i should have been warned off this company from the start when the images on their web - site did not display properly , however , i ordered a liteon blu - ray writer , as documented on their web - site , only to find it was a read only device .
negative	i returned the unit as it was not as_described on their web - site , paying the carriage , but because it was not actually faulty kikatek would not re - pay the carriage_costs .
negative	i e_- mailed them about this , but then of course they suddenly went silent , and did not respond .
negative	i would have spent a lot more with this company as i am_currently upgrading all my computers , but their failure to accept their responsibility just means i went elsewhere .
negative	they lost much more that the £ 0 . 00 they still owe me .
negative	i would not be able to deal with them again as i now have no faith in this company .
negative	after purchasing and paying for an item through this website , via_paypal - not a cheap purchase either ( nearly_£_000 ), i was never sent the item .
negative	i contacted the company on three different occasions by email , and tried constantly to phone them , but their phone was always ' busy ' or not answered .
negative	in short , i never did receive the item i '_d paid for .
negative	the company was for some time after still operating , as the website was still active .
negative	having checked now though , i see it '_s gone .
negative	there is indeed some justice in the world .
negative	for information , they also traded under the name ' dynamactrade '.
negative	i also contacted my local constabulary and made an official_complaint about this company .
negative	if you see or suspect that this lot have set_up another domain , please_please_please do not buy anything from them .
negative	they are fraudulent , and who_knows_how much they managed to make from innocent buyers over their period of operation .
negative	i took out the 00 day free trial .
negative	i didn_'_t even use it once as there was absolutely nothing worth watching .
negative	0_months later i found they had been taking money from my account with no notice and no reciepts .
negative	they refused to give me my money back saying nobody in the company had the authority to do that .
negative	this is a company that is not prepared to offer any customer service .
negative	if things go_wrong or you are unhappy with the service there is absolutely no redress with netflix .
negative	it is a company with no customer service , no professionalism and definitely no ethics .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	ordered two items , with business post 0 - 0 day delivery , after a week i contacted parmacy 0u as no sign of delivery , and was informed that one of the two items were out of stock .
negative	why - was i allowed to place an order for 0 - 0 day delivery on out of stock items ?
negative	why - did i get an_email to say delivery expected 0 - 0_days ?
negative	why - did no one contact me to say it was out of stock ?
negative	will never use again .
negative	misinformation , sneaky hidden_charges and no help whatsoever .
negative	just some of the way '_s i can describe my experience with inghams .
negative	i '_ve been to whistler in canada snowboarding many_times and have always booked with crystal and chosen ba flights .
negative	i have never before had any extra costs of snowboard carriage , hidden or not provided as an option at the time of booking .
negative	this year , for a change , i chose to give inghams a try for the first time and booked a holiday for 0 adults at a cost of just under_£ 0 , 000 , choosing the exact_same flights i always take , with ba .
negative	i booked around 0_months_ago , but have just received my eticket , after_reading the fine print , i '_ve found out that the snowboarding package holiday i '_ve booked , doesn_'_t allow us to take our snowboards - unless we pay them more .
negative	something that is not stated at any time during the holiday booking process , making this a hidden charge .
negative	if snowboard baggage on a snowboarding package holiday wasn_'_t included , this is surely very important information critical to the decision making process and as such , it should have been highlighted during the booking process .
negative	inghams purposely hide this additional_cost and as such obtained my booking by deception .
negative	after_speaking to inghams twice , once on the phone and once via social_media , i '_ve basically been told tough .
negative	not even a gesture of goodwill .
negative	they have not taken any responsibility for the fact that this information is not made available at the time of booking and i am very unhappy as i feel like i have been mislead by them .
negative	when questioned about this , i was told that sometimes they use scheduled flights , sometimes they use charter flights .
negative	some flights charge for bags , others include them , though this is not stated , so it is impossible for a customer booking online to know what kind of flight they are booking as part of a package .
negative	after saving for 0 years and being already stretched to the limit , this £_000 represents the cost of a lift pass , and is an extra_cost i neither budgeted for or have the money to find .
negative	0_weeks before a holiday .
negative	anything to say on this matter inghams ?
negative	any acknowledgement or sympathy for the fact that an_unexpected cost of £_000 , so close to a holiday can have a massive impact on a customers ability to actually afford to do anything whilst on holiday ?
negative	had i known about this additional_cost , i '_d have simply booked elsewhere as the overall cost of the holiday is now higher than i could have got it elsewhere .
negative	** updated 00 / 00 /_0000 **
negative	i went to the ba website today to book in my snowboard , but the price on the ba website was different (£_00 ) higher than the price inghams gave_me on my eticket .
negative	after phoning inghams again today to querey this , they simply told me that their terms and conditions state that ba prices might change .
negative	no apology at all for providing out of date information .
negative	i asked if i could pay for my snowboard bag and they told me i could only do that with ba .
negative	i asked them for ba '_s phone number , they told me they didn_'_t have it .
negative	i asked for contact details so i could make a complaint .
negative	they gave_me the email address that i complained to a fortnight ago and didn_'_t receive a response from .
negative	on the basis of this experience , i conclude that inghams are absolutely useless and massively unhelpful .
negative	if i have to book my baggage direct with ba , why on earth would i bother booking a package deal in the first place ?!
negative	i may as well have simply booked the flights and accommodation separately myself !
negative	i will not be booking with inghams again and will instead return to crystal or go back to making independent bookings next time i go to canada .
negative	this pre_- holiday experience with inghams has put a real downer on things as i now feel very negatively towards them and their lack of transparency and dodgy ethics , i '_m just hoping we don_'_t have any further problems with the trip as i have very little faith in their ability to do anything to help !
negative	this company should have delivered a rabbit hutch to me yesterday and didn_'_t despite me leaving a note when i had to go to school saying that a neighbour would sign .
negative	they left a card .
negative	i called them and was told that i could leave the card on door the next_day and they could then leave the delivery round the back .
negative	today i waited all day and went to school confident that it would be fine if i wasn_'_t there .
negative	they didn_'_t deliver .
negative	i called again and was told that the delivery driver had already gone home ( we live 00 miles from the braintree depot so he must have finished very early !).
negative	i was told that the driver had left a card .... he had not .
negative	he had not been !!
negative	the man on the phone said that they don_'_t deliver at weekends so it will now be monday .
negative	i said there '_s nothing i can do then is there ?.... no he said !
negative	very rude , and a liar !
negative	unfortunately when you order something you have no choice over the courier company used , but this makes the rabbit hutch company look very bad .
negative	if you order from somewhere that uses them , order with plenty of time to spare !
negative	i have also been ripped_off by this so called internet shop !
negative	i paid for eyesential product & received an_automated e_- mail informing_me it was out of stock .
negative	so i cancelled the order & requested my refund .
negative	over 0weeks_ago , & still no response from the thief '_s .
negative	i have e_- mailed them daily .
negative	they are a scam site .
negative	so if you have also been ripped_off by them , report them to consumer_direct , watchdog , & cardiff police , the same as i have done .
negative	my bank is now dealing_with these thief '_s .
negative	on arriving in ibiza at 0am we were keen to get to our hotel .
negative	we were kept waiting an_hour & 00_minutes for another flight to land .
negative	the driver spoke little english & was unable to offer an explanation .
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the attitude of the company '_s representatives when discussing returning an unsuitable product .
negative	i would never buy from this company again .
negative	my husband bought me some underwear from figleaves for christmas .
negative	since then i have noticed a debit of ten_pounds each_month from our bank_account to a company called shopperdisc . co . uk .
negative	after looking into it i have found that they have added my husband to a discount scheme that he does not recall agreeing to .
negative	this happened during the checkout_process , he was asked if he wanted to save money on further_purchases from figleaves , he said yes , but when he was directed to another page he decided not to agree to it .
negative	apparantly because he didn_'_t untick the box on the checkout page , they have been able to dip their hands into our bank_account each_month .
negative	we feel that this was not made clear to him at all and that he was in fact agreeing to something he was unaware of .
negative	we will not be using figleaves again because of this .
negative	we feel they should protect their customers , not leave them feeling duped .
negative	very annoyed .
negative	i ordered a canon_camera which was " in stock ", was told thre was a slight_delay with processing the order even_though i had paid for next_day delivery .
negative	here i am a month later with no camera and no refund after requesting one 0_weeks_ago .
negative	shocking company that has terrible customer_services .
negative	avoid this website .
negative	pay the extra to go with a more well_known company that you can_trust !
negative	!
negative	i placed my first order with beautybay and was really impressed with the price and speedy delivery .
negative	however i asked to return my delivery as unfortunately it was not suitable .
negative	it took two emails to finally get emailed a return certificate .
negative	i returned my goods on 00 jan , i continue to await a refund .
negative	i have contacted the company twice regarding this matter however there has_been no correspondance and no refund .
negative	please_beware if buying from this company !
negative	following posting this ad , the ball started rolling !
negative	i was finally going to receive the refund i was due !
negative	great , until i was refunded £ 0 . 00 when i was due £_00 !
negative	here we go with numerous_emails again !
negative	as already stated , unreliable , poor customer service , please be sensible and avoid this company unless you are 000_% sure what you are ordering will not need returned .
negative	this is my second bad_experience with yodel !!
negative	!
negative	have done some online shopping , and the company who was suppose to deliver the parcel was yodel .
negative	after apparent 0 unsuccessful delivery attempts i decided to contact the company i ordered from . they told me they will arrange another delivery for me .
negative	fine .
negative	yodel tried to deliver again but with no luck .
negative	so i went online to check the delivery status and it says : last delivery attempt was at 0 :_00am on the 00 / 00 . hmmm .....
negative	strange , because at 0 : 00 i was at home , no door_bell rang , the driver was suppose to contact me , but he didn_'_t of course .
negative	all i can says : yodel you are useless !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	thank_you very much
negative	complete and utter_waste of time and energy !
negative	did nothing to help !
negative	i have just spent 00_minutes waiting for the customer service team to answer the phone !
negative	that '_s how seriously they treat their customer service !
negative	i bought two items which were delivered promptly , however i was sent a self_assembly bar_stool with no instructions .
negative	jo the customer service agent couldn_'_t email me the instructions i now have to wait for them to be posted !
negative	what '_s the point in a quick delivery if i '_m now waiting days before it can be assembled ?
negative	i asked jo who was head of customer_services and he didn_'_t know ?
negative	wtf ?
negative	you work for them and you don_'_t know who your boss is ?
negative	jo also sounded_like he really couldn_'_t care less and that my complaint wasn_'_t valid or important !
negative	i had to ask for compensation and got offered a £ 0 voucher !!!
negative	i will never ever use home base again .
negative	do not touch them with a barge_pole !
negative	i was hesitant_about ordering a pair of skis online but the price was too good to pass up .
negative	when i ordered my skis , they indicated they were in stock and would be shipped in 0_days .
negative	after 0_weeks i had to write again asking when they would be shipped .
negative	they replied they were waiting for them to come in .
negative	i waited another week and wrote again .
negative	i was told they didn_'_t know when another shipment would be in and i could get a refund , wait for the skis or get a different pair .
negative	i took the refund .
negative	i felt it should have been them contacting me about the delay not me contacting them .
negative	needless to say i will not be back .
negative	went to a local ski store and they price matched the next best price i could find online .
negative	took longer_than said to come and awful quality costume for what i paid
negative	recipient had no clue who it was from as you left the card out !!!!!
negative	you also wrapped a big hamper in a little ribbon which wasn_'_t even tied up properly .
negative	looked disproportionate and silly !!!
negative	not impressed .
negative	won_'_t use again .
negative	i was told i would get £ 0 but in the end received nothing as i was told i had goven the wrong code number for the phone .
negative	highly unlikely .
negative	you now have a phone and i have no money .
negative	who is better off !!?
negative	?
negative	had to give one star but would have given them a minus .
negative	ordered a toyota hilux invincible black rear wheel arch from them through recommendation from 000spares . co . uk ( another company to avoid ).
negative	they said they had the exact item and in mint_condition .
negative	when received it was silver and not the correct_part and looked like it had been kicked around the breakers yard , so asked them to collect item and give full_refund of £_000 .
negative	guess_what , only got £_000 and after numerous_emails ( don_'_t bother to call as they are on premium_rate so getting more money out of you ) to them and also to the support section of 000spares , i '_ve got nowhere , so looks like i have to write this extra £_00 off .
negative	you '_ve been warned .....
negative	wanted a new black toyota hilux invincible wheel arch .
negative	went through their search_engine and got a quote .
negative	brilliant !
negative	then it went all downhill after that .
negative	got a call from jap parts saying they had the right part and in immaculate_condition at £_000 .
negative	so i paid and awaited the item .
negative	when it arrived , it was for a different make of toyota , was silver and looked like it had been kicked around the breakers yard .
negative	asked for them to collect the item and issue a refund .
negative	they wanted us to send it back at our cost originally but i refused and said that as it was their fault , they should arrange a collection , which they did .
negative	took photos of the wheel arch for proof of condition and also how it was packaged up so there would be no come_back .
negative	waited for the refund and guess_what i only got £_000 back .
negative	been backwards and forwards with 000 '_s support which is a joke , they no_longer respond and you just can '_t get_hold of jap parts .
negative	don_'_t bother to call as it is premium_rate .
negative	ordered rsvp_cards and cake boxes from bride_& groom .
negative	had to chase a number of times , by telephone , before items were delivered .
negative	cake boxes were ordered on 0th_november and were delivered on 00rd_november , the day before the wedding !
negative	when bride_& groom customer_services were contacted , they appeared to have no idea why items had not been delivered , but then promised next_day delivery , which did not happen .
negative	the rsvp_cards were pre printed , however we required a c / o address on them , when we received the card we indeed had a care off ( typed in full ) on them , but as time was of an essence , we could not afford to return the cards to bride_& groom for re printing .
negative	not only was the service received from bride_& groom terrible , but they use yodel as their delivery company and when combining the two , we poor customers stand no chance .
negative	doubtful will use pet_supermarket again poor delivery package delivered opened
negative	i have used_seranata_flowers for a couple of years_now and have never been disappointed in the past which made this latest experience even more so .
negative	i ordered some flowers for my daughter on saturday as she had just moved_into her new house .
negative	whilst they arrived in good time ( yesterday 0th_jan_0000 ) the flowers looked very old and tatty and will never be anything like the flowers portrayed on the website .
negative	i have emailed customer_services voicing my complaint along with a picture of the flowers and asking how they are going to resolve the matter .
negative	i await their reply .
negative	i ordered a ceramic kitchen_sink on the web_site , i had my order confirmed and received an_email_saying the order had been dispatched , and that was the last i heard .
negative	i emailed to ask when it was due to be delivered and didnt receive a reply , after a few more days i asked again when it would be delivered and again i had no reply , eventually the delivery company just delivered it and of course i was out , but i rearranged the delivery and now have the sink , but never_heard a work from your company .
negative	in the past i have always been pleased with my purchases until the 0st september when my parents_anniversary card turned_up faulty there was a nasty smear across it . i informed customer_services via_email twice and was ignored twice . on my third email they answered me and promised a replacement , however they emailed me to say they had shipped it along with a picture of the card .
negative	( the wrong one they had sent my nieces card instead ) however it never came . i emailed them again and they said would i like a refund that was on 00th_sept .. still no refund so i emailed again and they said they had refunded it into my account .. but after checking they clearly have not . it is now the 00th_oct still not received a card or a refund .
negative	so if you want good customer service from this company forget it , there quality of cards are very good but when something_goes_wrong their customer service is truly appalling .
negative	in march_0000 we stayed at butt hill cottage in troutbeck with lakelovers .
negative	the house was quite literally a building site with construction workers starting at 0am every day to replace the roof of the adjoining property .
negative	there was constant noise and banging all day and constant traffic .
negative	we could not use the garden because of all the debris falling_off the roof , or open the windows and had to keep the curtains upstairs closed because the workers could see into the bedroom .
negative	my holiday was ruined and we couldn_'_t wait to leave .
negative	three_weeks_later and i still cannot get a response from their md , paul liddell , despite_emailing and calling repeatedly .
negative	apart_from that , the house was dusty and not as_described on their website .
negative	i would say do not ever book with lakelovers . co . uk .
negative	i wish i had never_heard of them .
negative	am still_waiting for the delivery of items i ordered on the 0th_march , despite e_- mailing them and having a return phone_call to assure me i would have the items be the end of march .
negative	nothing - very unhappy grandchildren have returned home .
negative	having sold some things on ebay i thought that would try to send one of them by collect_+.
negative	this was a big mistake .
negative	first of all they mislaid it at the drop_off point for four days and then told me it has_been lost by the man in the van who they said that they couldn_'_t contact .
negative	finally i have been told that it has_been delivered but the packaging is in shreds and the new dress inside is unwearable since it is also torn .
negative	after 0 phone_calls and promises that they will phone me back i have recognised that their service and communication is appalling .
negative	i have now made a claim but have still got no reply .
negative	never again .
negative	they are hardly_any cheaper_than royal_mail so i say give collect_+ a miss i certainly will
negative	you advertise goods that you purport to have in stock when clearly you haven_'_t .
negative	this not only disappoints the customer but wastes their time as they have to research elsewhere .
negative	the ending result is that you will never be used again as you can '_t be trusted to deliver .
negative	after a technical_error i was charged_twice on my debit_card and sent two identical orders .
negative	on trying to resolve the issue , i was given a managerial number to call - to which i called numerous_times however the person was contently away at lunch and unavailable .
negative	i then had to pay to send back the items after being told i would not be able to return them to store for return of cash .
negative	it seems completely ludicrous that i had to pay for postage and packaging for an_error on your computer system .
negative	i will never be shopping online with superdry again .
negative	i am still_waiting for my order to be delivered , as this is my first order it will be my last too .
negative	i finished work early to have my tyres_changed and the wrong tyres were delivered to the garage .
negative	i will have to go another day to have the right set fitted .
negative	quick easy payment , delivery fast came within one working day ( even_though only selected free delivery which was estimated 0 - 0 working_days . )
negative	however a piece was missing sent email to customer_services who failed to respond to emails .
negative	item came in plain cardboard_box obviously not original box for item ????
negative	?
negative	overall despite fast delivery overall experience disappointing
negative	out of 000 supposed suppliers no reply was recieved
negative	i have been with vodafone for 0 years within those years they have never called or inform by email sms callback regarding the end of my contract or if i want a upgrade .
negative	i also couldnt successfully transfer the account user details to my daughter who is the main payer of the account as vodafone never seems to change the details . then finally after calling them last_week i told them i wanted to cancel one contract totally and have a lower price plan offer on another and they didnt listen to me and gave_me two new set of contracts !
negative	then i called them back to cancel both contracts and they made the whole situaition lengthy and started_playing pass the parcel around with me .
negative	i couldnt get through to any one to inform them i am fustrated and want to leave vodafone totally .
negative	after a while i finally get through to a rude help_desk lady and i inform her i want to cancel my contract and she goes i cant do it as she suspects im frauding as the account is put under mr instead of mrs but has my full name surname and dob .
negative	then she was telling_me to speak proper english and hanged up .
negative	vodafone has a really rubbish customer service and really racist call_center staff .
negative	i do not recommend this service for decent consumers as vodafone will do . anything to get moneyoff you .
negative	i have never_experienced this kind of service with 00 , tmobile or even 0g which is based on otherside of the world !
negative	their customer service was 000 x better .
negative	regards
negative	the worst customer service ever !
negative	had a long conversation to arrange a small item be sent 0st_class on friday to receive saturday .
negative	agreed that the item must not be sent for a courier deliver monday as was needed saturday and they completely_ignored and sent as a monday courier delivery - absolute fools .
negative	it wasn_'_t difficult the guy_who agreed he would personally send a small adapter in an envelope 0st_class only had to the simple task of poppng a small item in a evelope and posting , simple but this was obvuiously beyond his capability !
negative	after buying several 000 '_s of metres of lights over the last 0 - 0 years wouldn_'_t touch these idiots with a rage pole again .
negative	mobile phone of less_than 0 month_old sent in .
negative	valued at around £_00 which was bad enough but then had an_email to say it failed testing as it was locked to a network !
negative	like most i would imagine .
negative	they then said it would be worth £ 0 . 00 and if i didn_'_t want it £ 0 . 00 to send the mobile back .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	absolute cowboys !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered flowers and balloon for a 00th_birthday on 0 . 0 . 00 to be delivered on 0 . 0 . 00 .
negative	they were not delivered at all .
negative	despite_numerous e_-_mails from me to them , no reply , and without a direct telephone_number they are not contactable .
negative	my order came to £_00 . 00 , the money was taken but they have not got back to me to say why they have not delivered the flowers , or apologise , just nothing .
negative	disgraceful and totally_unacceptable .
negative	i am writing to them .
negative	i will take this further with local media , i want my money back and an_apology .
negative	this is an update_: i received a text saying the driver could not gain_access .
negative	there was a buzzer at the gate that you press to gain entrance , also serenata claim the driver leaves a card if they have this problem , no card left .
negative	the large postbox was at the gate , so no excuse as they didn_'_t need to gain_access to do this small thing .
negative	i get the feeling they want to try to re - deliver this again , this is now no good , the flowers will not be fresh enough and the balloon useless .
negative	the moment has_gone as the birthday was the 0th not today or tomorrow , no response yet again from my e_-_mails to their own email in - box , just ignored .
negative	only a refund will due now , both serenata and yodel are not doing all that is claimed on the website , totally_unacceptable .
negative	i expect this update to be ignored as well .
negative	0nd update_: finally serenata have sent me a text to say non - delivery , and actually put that on their website as well .
negative	this does not help me in the slightest other than tell me what i already know .
negative	i have sent a letter which they should receive by monday at the latest , if they do not advise me of a refund i will take this matter up with the local media , i just want my money back please serenata .
negative	finally !
negative	had a reply for serenata saying how sorry they were and that they had been let_down my their courier .
negative	they apologised and offered me a refund , which is all i ever wanted .
negative	thankyou serenata .
negative	booked a cut and blow_dry , got told by the salon there weren_'_t any appointments available .
negative	booked a ' conspiracy theory tour , was told to book it through the website but you can '_t book through the website and there is no e_- mail address or phone number for contact .
negative	booked a photography_course , e_- mailed the company and left messages on their mobile , ałl of which was ignored .
negative	got refunds for the first two but twice i '_ve contacted groupon customer_services over the photography_course , last time i was told it would be looked into and they '_d e_- mail me , they haven_'_t .
negative	avoid at ałl costs .
negative	after looking at ałl these reviews , i feel a complete idiot for even considering groupon , obviously it '_s just another money making scam .
negative	first month of a 0 year contract and what a shit company .
negative	i '_d been with orange years with 000 mins never gone over 0 month with 000 mins with vodafone and i '_m over by 000_+ mins costing 00 +_p per min .
negative	all because this company charge you per min not second .
negative	i '_m not sure how they get away with this but it '_s discussing .
negative	now stuck counting_down the month till i can say screw you vodafone .
negative	the service from this company is appalling .
negative	they could not deliver the shower ordered on time .
negative	you cannot_speak to customer_services as they do not take phone_calls , i was told i had to send an_email which i did and then got a response saying i was 00th in a que .
negative	i am still_waiting for my refund which i am told will be next , this means i will have have 0 wait 0_weeks for my money .
negative	warning if you want your products on time do not order from this company .
negative	they cannot deliver when promised and you cannot_speak to anyone to find out why .
negative	my one thousand_pounds relyon mattress was delivered on thursday 0th_december .
negative	after the first night there was deep sinkage in the bed where i had slept .
negative	i weigh just under nine stones , so weight isn_'_t the issue .
negative	i persevered a couple of nights , then on monday called " customer service " ( laugh !)
negative	and was told this is normal and they wouldn_'_t even consider looking at it for six_weeks .
negative	another night and by then i was in so much pain i called customer service in tears , my back was unbelievably painful .
negative	they agreed to send someone to inspect the mattress a week and a half later .
negative	the next_day i couldn_'_t cope with the pain any more and called again , and spoke so a young guy_who agreed it could be replaced , but it had to be for at_least the same amount .
negative	off i went to the store to choose another to find they are nearly all latex ( i am allaergic to this ) or memory_foam , plus the one i had bought which was beyond useless .
negative	i asked for my money back and was then given lots of excuses .
negative	be warned , bensons say a two inch dip where you sleep is perfectly normal and to be expected .
negative	after one use .
negative	i am making a fuss about nothing apparently .
negative	they are the biggest bedding company yada yada .
negative	their beds are rubbish and customer service even worse .
negative	they ignore emails sent via their website , and letters sent by regular mail .
negative	i am off to john_lewis to buy a mattress , which i tried two_days ago and they are much_better quality and actually cheaper .
negative	bensons are bandits , selling rubbish and no after sales service at all .
negative	one week on and a thousand_pounds worse off .
negative	i used talktalk at a previous address and everytime i rang up i got appauling service .
negative	noone spoke english and actually asked me what some words meant !
negative	i rang 0 times just to move address and it was still not done .
negative	so i cancelled and im very happy with bt !
negative	i rather pay a little more to bt and have zero hassle than pay minimal for something that is clearly a shambles !
negative	gumtree value a customer ’_s purse , but short - change you on every_single aspect of customer_satisfaction .
negative	however , i have given permission for gumtree to reply to this post , because there are 0 sides to every story .
negative	no reply ..........!
negative	sums their services - up , far better_than i could have worded .
negative	case closed , because a caring - company would have shown their true colours .
negative	received pelvic toner 0_days after i ordered it .
negative	that '_s when the
negative	problems started .
negative	the pelvic toner was faulty .
negative	i phoned the
negative	company and they told me some other things to try .
negative	however , the
negative	pelvic toner was still faulty .
negative	the following_day i again phoned the
negative	co . but it was constantly_engaged .
negative	i left 0 messages , but as yet
negative	no - one has returned my messages .
negative	i am not fully_satisfied with this company they are quick to take your money for fast delivery however no costume deliverd in time , when i called it took me two hours to get through to them also when i did the advisor just casually told me that my costume would be deliverd a day later as they were very busy no notice i had paid for fast delivery when i started to complain she just said o well we will give u back ur fast delivery payment as if she was giving me something free i would have expected this anyway !!!
negative	when i went on to complain further about the service she then said would it help if we gave u back all the delivery charge i am sill not completely_satisfied and will wait with antisipation as to if this money actually goes into my bank or not i would not advise anyone_wishing for fast service to use this company there service is shocking !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered many items , all of which said they were in stock .
negative	got a call on the day they were supposed to arrive to say the refrigerated items did not get loaded_onto the van and that they would be delivered the following_day .
negative	the following_day 0 of the 0 refrigerated items were delivered and the delivery note said the other items were out of stock .
negative	when i called to express my annoyance that a ) these items hadn_'_t arrived even_though i was able to order them and at the time of ordering it did not say they were out of stock and b ) that they were a day late , the person i spoke to could not care less .
negative	appalling customer service !
negative	will not be ordering from them again .
negative	ordered flowers to be delivered for someone '_s 00th_birthday , gave plenty of notice i . e .
negative	00_hours , then the day before they rang to say they couldn_'_t find anyone to do a delivery .
negative	by then it was too late for me to get someone_else .
negative	very poor service .
negative	they should make it clear on their website if there are any areas that are difficult to deliver to .
negative	i had my parcel delivered to work but i can '_t_believe my name wasn_'_t written anywhere on the outside of the parcel !!!
negative	the ladies in the office had to open the parcel to find the invoice and still it was not apparent who the parcel was for as my name wasn_'_t on the invoice either !
negative	they had to telephone pharmacy0u to find out who to give it to !... i find this absolutely_shocking .... by nature of the company ' pharmacy ', what was in that parcel was private and should have remained so .
negative	the ladies in the office were mortified that they had to open the package .
negative	for this very reason , i doubt i will ever purchase from this company again .
negative	hi there jm i have had costumes from you before and they were second to none , good quality and delivered quick time :) but the 0 elf costumes i got this month were so bellow standard the buttons fell_off when i opened the package the material was spit through soooo disapointed :(
negative	i have been using internet to book my regul ; ar rotation holidays as well as my regul ; ar travel of my family .
negative	i used to book directly with gulf air online after checking prices of same distenation tickets online . if i need to cancel or change with gulf air most of the time they charge me nothing . this time i have booked two tickets with e_- booker to fly on gulf air for an amount of gb 000 . 0 when i wanted to cancele i got penalized one full ticket price . ihe refund amount will almost gb 000_+ few_pounds .
negative	lessons_learnt don_'_t deal with e_- bookers
negative	regards
negative	do not use and if you have already commented report them to trading_standards .
negative	i have had no replies to any emails no contact number , flowers didn_'_t turn_up , not been refunded had to go to my bank and call it back with proof of purchase .
negative	i think it is ridiculous that you have sent me a survey to value my product when i still have not received it
negative	not impressed with the speed of delivery , that '_s all i can say .
negative	item sold on ebay was very well_packaged but arrived at its_destination looking like it had been dropped repeatedly and kicked in at the side .
negative	the cake_stand inside was completely_smashed so i had to refund the buyer .
negative	however i can not claim from collectplus as they do not cover china items .
negative	a second item i sent arrived a day later than the longest estimated delivery time provided by collectplus so i received a complaint from the buyer .
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	thought i '_d bought a washing_machine online , only to be rung up and told i shouldn_'_t have been able to buy that particular machine online , only in store .
negative	also advertised free delivery and charged me £_00 . 00 .
negative	after being told i couldn_'_t have the machine i " bought " online , tried to sell me a more_expensive one .
negative	went elsewhere and bought it .
negative	won_'_t use their website again .
negative	not helpful in any way , customers service extremely poor as flowers and delivery paid for in full not recieved as requested . however its was to be delivered to wrong door number , nothing was done to resolve the situation at the time enquring . i recieved no flower as a result no clear explaination from the call_center or respond to what happened . very poor service .
negative	it was all paid for in full and no show ... you are bunch of thieves and a rip_off as a service provide , m neighour can confirm she did not recived the flowers for mothers_day !
negative	no recommendation will be offered to anyone ; as i paid for absolutly nothing .
negative	ordered a card for a special person on the friday and paid the £ 0 . 00 to guarantee delivery on the saturday , guess_what no delivery so no card , im very angry about this as what is the point in paying £ 0 , 00 for a guaranteed delivery and it doesnt come , i had to rush out to the shops for a run of the mill birthday card , not good enough moonpig , then to top it off no staff of a weekend
negative	bauerfind elbow brace sent late . used and wrong_size .
negative	manufacturer not certain it was supplied by them , now being investigated
negative	still_waiting on order from aspire jewellery meant to be here 00 days ago
negative	took great carae to pick an arranagaement for my daughter without lilies in as her two sons are allergic to them only to find that when they arrived they had been put in .
negative	order on 00 / 00 /_0000 and still not received anything !
negative	cannot contact them via there website or by phone which is constantly_engaged .
negative	wrote on 00 / 00 /_0000 and have received no reply whatsoever .
negative	h . watkins .... am am not a competitor and i '_m pretty sure that none of the other bad postings are competitors , merely very annoyed , ripped_off people !
negative	as mentioned until order arrives here unable to comment .
negative	ordering was however problematic .
negative	i did email the company with several questions stating i would telephone to place order , and would like questions_answered by email prior to ringing uk
negative	from greece , the questions were cheaper to ask via_email than telephone .
negative	the company did reply_saying ' thats fine ' but questions were unanswered - hence a long and expensive telephone_call prior to placing order .
negative	i can not call this a service because it is not .
negative	you never get paid the cashback you are entitled too and when you contact quidco support all you ever get from them is palmed off .
negative	they tell a company will pay in 00 to 000 days and when you contact quidco after 0_months still not receiving payment , all you are then told not to worry as they take 0_months to pay .
negative	what a joke
negative	i would not recommend this company to me worst_enemy
negative	booked a party here in the dragonfly suite .
negative	the organiser is useless , she told us we could decorate the room in the daytime and then booked another party in without mentioning it .
negative	the food was rubbish and we didnt get all we paid for .
negative	the organiser is rude and has no customer service skills whatsoever .
negative	dont book a party in these rooms - they dont_know what they ' re doing .
negative	i booked a flamenco dancer in june as a surprise for my sisters party at the end of july .
negative	i was told it was booked but then they let_me down on the night .
negative	they dont answer phone_calls or emails and on the rare_occasion they do respond they lead you to believe that you still have a booking .
negative	they didnt even have the decency to ring me on the night to let_me know the dancer wasnt coming and when i tried to ring them they blanked my calls .
negative	i would never use this company again and wouldnt recommend anybody_else to use them if you dont want to be let_down .
negative	brought a hillman golf_trolley for my husband '_s birthday feb_0000 it has broken down more times than it '_s been on the golf_course !
negative	finally after being sent replacement_parts twice the trolley has_been returned to uk sports_imports , their customer service is shocking we have been told the battery is faulty and not covered by the warranty and they want £_00 . 00 to replace the battery !
negative	we had the battery tested and it was fully charged !
negative	after_spending £_000 . 00 on a trolley that has only been on the course twice do i want to throw good money after bad !
negative	i only had talk_talk phone and broadband and in 0 month i have been charged over_£_000_pound when i disputed this i was told they couldn_'_t understand_why and would look into it but after nyumrous call nothing was done so i requested the service be disconnected which they did then sent me another bill for £_00 so in total less_than 0_months with this company cost over_£_000 i have disputed this with them to no_avail .
negative	i would never go back to talk_talk think very carefully before choosing them .
negative	feel the quality is very good value for money but we were most upset when the sales_rep was very helpful selecting our £ 0000 order but then was very rude with my wife when she declined the insurance / care package .
negative	initially the rep put the insurance on the order and she had to ask for it to be taken off .
negative	one must assume they have targets to hit on the sales of the care package but no excuse for bullying .
negative	also paid for next week delivery only to be told the next_day that it wasn_'_t possible and now looking at a month for delivery so don_'_t trust them re delivery dates .
negative	this means we will have to carry on living out of boxes for the next month and only found this out re tracking order with no communication from the company
negative	looks like we went to the wrong retail_park as everyone else has had a good experience .
negative	i asked for this order to be cancelled and they shipped it out anyway .
negative	very annoying as i now have to mess around getting it shipped back to them .
negative	i phoned ebookers and spent half an_hour on the phone .
negative	the girl was gaffing about on the phone and kept telling_me she had to check something .
negative	it was almost as if they got more money from the phone company , the longer they could keep me on the line .
negative	before i knew what was happening , she put me on hold only to come_back and say that she had lost the flight price she had quoted me .
negative	the flight price went from circa £_000 to over a £ 0000 .
negative	i rang off and booked the flight elsewhere .
negative	i rang back later to use points for a domestic flight to connect the international flights i booked elsewhere and when i received the confirmation for that flight , they had booked the wrong time and i had to ring them back for them to cancel and rebook at their expense .
negative	shocking service .
negative	i earn_points with my credit_card , which is the only_reason for ringing them , but even with those , their conversion rates i . e .
negative	the ability to purchase flights with points are so high i will be in my grave before i can_afford a transatlantic flight !
negative	!
negative	ordered a present for my husband from next who are using myhermes for deliveries .
negative	it was supposed to be next_day delivery .
negative	one week_later i '_m still_waiting .
negative	on the tracking website they reckon they have tried to deliver twice and no one was in so they left a calling_card .
negative	someone has_been in the house the whole time and no calling cards have been left either .
negative	next have been in touch with the courier twice in the last 00hrs who faithfully promised to deliver by 00 . 00 this morning .
negative	guess_what ?
negative	still no parcel .
negative	not sure i am going to order goods from next anymore ......
negative	they need to try a new courier
negative	i ordered prescription_sunglasses on 0th_may - frames showed as " in stock " on the website when i ordered .
negative	i received an_email_confirmation on 0th_may confirming the frames were in stock and being moved from the warehouse to the laboratory - bit odd as the website had said they were in stock already .
negative	then had an_email on 00th_may to say they had received the frames from the supplier , so they weren_'_t ever in stock in the first place !
negative	i then had no further communication from them until i contacted them on 00st_may to ask for progress as the website still showed my order as " processing " .
negative	i received the following reply on 0st june : " we are extremely sorry for the delay .
negative	there was a delay as the glasses as a 0st set of lenses had failed quality checks and we had to reorder another pair of the lenses .
negative	we can confirm that the order is being_processed and your order will be dispatched asap ."
negative	no very asap as i heard_nothing further until i contacted them yesterday when the website still showed " processing ".
negative	a webchat then revealed that they had dispatched the glasses ( no notification to me ) and they tried to say that it was my fault for not being in to receive a delivery - no card from the couriers , no delivery attempted !
negative	glasses finally arrived this morning and as i picked them up from the case , a lens fell out !
negative	beyond_belief !
negative	so , truly abysmal service , order took far too long ( the website says five working_days , but possibly up to 00 days ), shoddy workmanship .
negative	don_'_t use this website !
negative	!
negative	needed to cancel a flexible booking but the website would not complete the cancellation .
negative	it provided a phone number which was unrecognised .
negative	customer_services was very hard to contact and eventually sent me an_email_telling_me to ring another number , which i did and was then told to ring the first unrecognised number !
negative	i am assured by them that the booking has_been cancelled and my money repaid but it still shows as live on the website .
negative	will never book with them again .
negative	i order the part on the internet was later phoned as payment hadnt gone_through & paid_extra for next_day delivery .
negative	later called again to say part now would not come over night probably couple of days should expect it friday .
negative	rebooked our customer to fit in with this plan .
negative	then got another call saying parts was damaged so couldnt now be delivered till saturday .
negative	i cancelled the order .
negative	i have e_mailed you as only payment shows on credit_card statement & not the credit .
negative	returned a quad bought for my son for christmas which was faulty .
negative	there was no battery_charger included and the electicals inside wasnt connected to the motor properly .
negative	the manager said as i didnt have the reciept i couldnt have a straight exchange i would need to pay an extra £_00 .
negative	disgusting as i paid via the argos_card and had the payment details on the statement just not the item code , disgusting !!
negative	!
negative	tesco : they are such snobs and their customer service is dreadful ...
negative	i had a bad service from them last_week and even the ceo '_s office did not really do anything per_se to compensate how we were treated .
negative	they made a mistake to be condescending to us as i shall_continue to point out the truth : tesco thing that they are the big cheese but their bad customer service already made them to forget to go into the french market and they had to quit the us market : i wonder_why ... not .
negative	lidl even sainsbury '_s are better at looking after their customers .
negative	having more than 00 years of experience within the hospitality and services industires with the usa , germany and the uk , i know what i am talking_about .
negative	avoid tesco .
negative	i dont trust this site used them before when my account was closed i kept getting emails_telling my i owe them money which i never did my account was clear this went one for a while so i stay well clear
negative	im not happy with this company the reason_why is down to the way they treated my neighbour ,
negative	she ask me to book her a flight to irleand she is in her 00s she flew out a day before she cam home she was told that her flight was delayed and to go to the airport which she did , the person she spoke to said if she wanted another flight it would cost her over a £_000_pounds which was a lot so it was a case of stay in the airport or pay
negative	tesco isnt like it used to be its lost its customer_sevices mind you im not sure it had any to start with , they must think there customers are stupid to fall for there so called price drop and there programmed to say im_sorry to hear that drives me nuts i come the end of the year my club card goes in the shredder and my nectar_card gets a boost
negative	i fill robbed every time i buy my licence fee i dont have much to watch 0 / 0 programs in the morning if im really lucky and i mean really i may find some thing to watch on bbc 0 or 0 , and now ive got my husband moaning there not showing the full f0 races , and if that wasnt bad enough its the sports that take place over any thing else and it has to been showen on more then one channel drives me mad drop the fee once and for all i can think what to do with £_000 thats for sure
negative	give them a wide_berth ,
negative	we paid total balance when ordering sofa on 00 / 00 / 00 advised by salesman it would be with us in 00 weeks at the very latest probably before .
negative	received 0 e_-_mails right up to 00 / 00 / 00 advising it would be delivered week begining 00 / 00 / 00 then yesterday received an e_- mail from csl for me to contact them arrange delivery and told the only dates i could have it delivered are 00st , 00nd and 00rd_dec i told them this was over the 00 weeks and was told to check the small_print as they can not always deliver within the 00 weeks ( not what their salesman told me ).
negative	advised them that i had booked week of 00 / 00 off work as holidays needed to be submitted due to christmas and told there was nothing they could do about it i '_m not entitled to compensation , can not cancel the order and only_thing they could suggest was to ask someone_else to wait in for it !
negative	to be fair the customer service lady was trying to be helpful bu also had her hands tied .
negative	paid £_000 for delivery and they can not even deliver it when they promised .
negative	buyer_beware go somewhere_else
negative	they have my phone and won_'_t send me my money because it '_s value is under_£_00 and i have to send them more phones to make up the shortfall within 0_months .
negative	:((((
negative	i do not understand_why ebuyer is using parcel_force .
negative	i rang today customer service as parcel_force was meant to deliver my item today again they have delays .
negative	i wasted a hole day waiting for the parcel .
negative	i was not pleased by the customer service lady she rang parcel_force she apologised but no compensation or in anyway was i told on how to air my concerns .
negative	after several orders now i am afraid i have to suspend doing my shopping with ebuyer and just stick to amazon .
negative	i have no_intention to wasted my days waiting for parcel_force .
negative	i then kind of told by ebuyer customer service you just have to wait_till tomorrow what about the day i lost ?
negative	i really should be getting some compensation and please use a different company or apply pressure coos looking in the internet every one says ebuyer good but stop using it because parcel forece is absolute terrible !
negative	!
negative	order no 00000000
negative	order date 00 / 00 / 0000account no 0000000
negative	customer ref 00u00000x0000000k
negative	information given about the price during the transaction wasn_'_t very clear .
negative	the full_amount to pay should have been shown before submitting , not after !
negative	!
negative	ordered some shelf clips with " next_day delivery " as a shelf in the office had collapsed .
negative	they didn_'_t arrive .
negative	after a couple of days i emailed to query the whereabouts of the item and they said " oh , they should have been delivered - we '_ll contact the couriers ".
negative	two_days_later i hadn_'_t heard back so emailed again and they replied to say " sorry , we ' re still trying to trace the items with the courier , would you like a refund ?"
negative	i explained i didn_'_t want the refund as i wanted the item !
negative	a further 0_days_later i emailed again and was told " we have been unable to trace the order with the courier .
negative	would you like a refund ?"
negative	as it is now two_weeks since i ordered with the " next_day delivery " i have said yes , fine , i '_ll have a refund and will go back to amazon where they are more_expensive but at_least you know it '_ll arrive !
negative	i didn_'_t feel that officenerd really cared whether my order ever replied or not and their constant efforts to get me to accept a refund seemed to be an attempt to get me off their case rather_than an example of good customer service .
negative	i placed an order on 0st april with boots . com , it arrived at the local yodel depot at 0am on 0th_april , now on 00th_april it is still not here and is still showing as being in the depot .
negative	they are worse_than useless to speak to , don_'_t care at all about customer service , i wish they could be closed_down .
negative	boots have been kind in apologising and giving me a partial_refund etc , but they can '_t get any more info out of yodel than i can .
negative	i doubt the parcel will ever arrive .
negative	if i could give yodel 0_stars i would .
negative	having to call three_times 0pm to find out where my delivery is only to be told repeatedly someone would call back , they didn_'_t .
negative	was spoken to very rudely by a ( name ), customer service clearly not her strong point .
negative	shame as i would have placed another order for wall_tiles , obviously won_'_t be now
negative	poor quality .
negative	0 pages were blank .
negative	extremely disappointed as it was for a fathers_day gift .
negative	offer a refund but i cant get to the post_office to return the item within the required time due to having a c - section .
negative	will never use or recommend again
negative	after arriving home from work i checked to see status of my order via_amazon then was shocked to read that yodel had delivered my item today to porch ??
negative	what is a concern is that my porch was closed and windows closed as i work !!
negative	i immediatly contacted yodel and put in query wheres my stuff ??
negative	i was informed that item delivered on left on porch !!
negative	im_sure u can apprciate my language then to this shabby courier service .. yodel then stated amazons fault as theyve delivered as requested ??
negative	i then stated surely someone with a brain would realise if no one in and item too_big to go through window ( if was open ) then they should have re attempted to deliver !!
negative	no apparantly they left on porch ???
negative	which basically means they left my goods on full_view for anyone to see and remove !!
negative	i hasten to add no cards or anything left either ..
negative	i have logged this with yodel and amazon and obviously amazon will kindly replace but surely to god ( sorry ) any person with a brain wouldnt leave goods on doorstep .. apparantly driver to be interviewed grrrrrrrrr i wish i was there cos he or she would get a piece of my mind .... a very disruntled customer :-(
negative	totaly desapointed with the delivery still not arrived at 00h00 french time after a couple of week .
negative	your delivery firm told they came on the 00th ........ what a joke i have been here all day long and today i tried to follow the delivery !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	since 0 . 00 in the lorry ????????????????
negative	but still not here !!!
negative	and we are leaving very closed to nice ( good luck ) my wife phoned you this afternoon but nothing still happen so my comments if you excuse me are not very good , perhaps not directly your faulte but still we are waiting our things .
negative	please do not_hesitate to contact myself directly on myy mobile if you wish ( french n : 0 + 0 00 00 00 00 )
negative	thanks
negative	r . chapelier
negative	ordered sink and cabinet - received email_saying it had been dispatched then following_day received email to say out of stock
negative	still_awaiting delivery & have even taken my money
negative	not what you call good customer service
negative	then received email asking me to rate service ?
negative	let '_s hope it arrives this week before i take the matter further
negative	no stars out of 0 if i had the choice
negative	i ordered a rug recieved an_email_stating it had been dispatched and will be with me in 00_hours 0_days_later didn_'_t have it sent an_email to see what had happened was told it was out of stock they were sorry and offered a 00_%_discount after taking 0_days off work unpaid losing a total of £_000 wages this company is a disgrace wouldn_'_t have a rug off them now if they were giving it away
negative	there was no card sent with the flowers so the recipient didn_'_t know who had sent them , despite us completing one prior to ordering the flowers !!!!!!!
negative	we will never order from this company again .
negative	i wanted to sell my car but after putting all the datails in they asked me to verify my account .
negative	unfortunately their system didn_'_t know the pin provided by preloved themselves .
negative	they called me fraudulent as i couldn_'_t give in any other pin ( i hadn_'_t got any other pin , just one ).
negative	beware of this website !
negative	there is only one party that is fraudulent and that '_s not me !
negative	the value of the beds and the expertise of the sales_staff was completely undermined by the attitude and carelessness of the delivery crew for dreams .
negative	they were obviously stretched for time , had no interest in customer service , and simply wanted to get in and out as quickly as possible !
negative	unfortunately , i had bought two beds from dreams and so had to go through this awful experience twice .
negative	would never recommend dreams to friends , but will use our local_independent furniture store next time who employ friendly customer_focused drivers who treat the customer properly !
negative	when we dropped_off the car at calverton parking depot , we had quite a long wait before the mini_bus took us to the airport .
negative	similarly , when we returned from holiday , as instructed we rang the telephone_number given and had quite a long wait at the airport for the mini_bus to collect us .
negative	this subsequently made me late for work as i was going straight to work from the airport .
negative	in addition , it was apparent when we got into our vehicle on collection , that someone had been driving the car in our absence .
negative	the car engine was very warm , the fuel monitor had reduced by around 00 - 00 miles and the radio station had been charged .
negative	it was obvious to us that someone had been driving the car in our absence .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable and we will not be using this company again .
negative	i don_'_t normally_write_reviews but my experience was sufficiently bad that i thought it was worth taking some time to share my experience .
negative	from reading the other reviews it looks like precious_little one is a company that , if everything goes well , can offer good value but buyer_beware if it doesn_'_t .
negative	i ordered a mattress 0_weeks before my due date as i found my original one didn_'_t fit properly .
negative	as it was under_£_00 the charge for delivery was £ 0 . 00 , which i felt was a bit_steep but as i needed the mattress asap , was willing to pay .
negative	00 days_later my mattress hasn_'_t arrived - i '_ve called the customer service dept and they said according to their system there were none in stock when i ordered , so it was sent out 0nd_class (!)
negative	a couple of days ago .
negative	despite the fact that i am sure the website did not say this when i ordered ( or i would have gone_elsewhere ), i have been told its basically tough_luck .
negative	this business thinks it is perfectly acceptable to mislead their customers when ordering , then charge them £ 0 . 00 for a second class royal_mail delivery ( which it '_s worth_noting is their company policy ) to be sent out whenever the item finally becomes in stock .
negative	i am still yet to receive the mattress .
negative	i also e_- mailed the customer complaints_dept who said the same thing in a slightly more polite way .
negative	their ordering system apparently says that they had none in stock ( they '_ve even offered to send me a print out to prove it !)
negative	and therefore they see no fault .
negative	they have neglected to address the fact that this wasn_'_t reflected on the website when i ordered it , so either there is a issue updating information to the website or they think i ordered it in the knowledge that it was out of stock 0_weeks before my due date and for some unknown_reason am now taking time out of my day to complain to them about it ?!?
negative	!
negative	i can see from other reviews that where there is an issue , the ' customer service ' department seems to be tasked to defend their position , rather_than actually provide any customer service .
negative	i would say , if you find similar prices on other_websites ( good ones like kiddicare will price match ), then save_yourself the potential hassle if things go_wrong and shop elsewhere .
negative	no note left by driver to say what address it was at left with a neighbour at the end of the street instead of local to my add who would know me .
negative	box and content damaged large hole in side
negative	i waited a few_days for my order , then emailed animed asking where my order was .
negative	i had a reply_saying it hadnt been dispatched yet , that one of the items was out of stock but i would get a refund and the rest of the order would be sent .
negative	yes i did get the rest of the order but i was annoyed that i only knew of the out of stock item when i emailed .
negative	i wouldve bought the whole order somewhere_else .
negative	also when i recieved my credit_card statement they had taken the full_amount !
negative	i am_currently_awaiting a reply
negative	we find the stools very uncomfortable , the back rest cuts right into your lower back , we removed the backrests .
negative	the fabric stains if you touch it with dirty hands , i have small children and now matter_how hard you try this happens , and also these are chairs for the breakfast_bar - where you handle food !
negative	we find that our son is too light in weight so his chair does not go down to the right height , we have to sit on it for him !
negative	i will not recommend this product , it is not great .
negative	as i said their service is very good .
negative	i managed to speak to first customer service person_who answered my question by replying a , then she passed me through to another customer service person to whom i spoke after another half an_hour who replied to my same question with b , then he said he would put me straight through to another person instantaneously , but not i had to wait another half an_hour and the third person then put down the phone in front of my nose !!!
negative	after 00_minutes of waiting i did not get anywhere apart_from finding out that they are completely_useless giving different answers to the same question and laying that they would put me straight through without further wait .
negative	and this is not for the first time i had this problem with them .
negative	rubbish !!!
negative	!
negative	don_'_t use this company !
negative	never received item as i paid for and when emailed i received no reply , over_£_00 lost .
negative	ordered flowers as surprise , wrong ones sent , the ones received blooms were damaged and brown .
negative	on contacting them was offered 00_% refund which i have accepted
negative	i ordered online and requested delivery to a local_store .
negative	i received confirmation_email_stating delivery is very quick to stores so orders can '_t be changed .
negative	great i thought .
negative	over a week it took to get delivered to the store , i emailed customer_services who said we will send a text when it '_s been delivered to store .
negative	how does that help me or find out what happened to my order .
negative	i sent more emails and they did not respond till after i had the clothes and they sent an_email_saying out records show you have collected your stuff .
negative	very unsatisfied with the delivery to the store option .
negative	if this was stated before hand i would have had a chance to decide for myself .
negative	i didn_'_t receive apology 0p off good gesture nothing
negative	i write with regards to my order that i placed over a week_ago .
negative	i have requested twice_now for an rma number so that i can return the product that i bought , yet you have still not replied .
negative	you are clearly in breach of the distance_selling regulations 0000 , as you have not provided me with the information that i need to return the product .
negative	i am outraged at this poor customer service .
negative	i have paid a lot of money to you .
negative	i demand to have your telephone_number so that i can speak to someone directly and return my glasses .
negative	since i haven_'_t purchased anything from dobies sending me this review rating is pointless and i presume a mistake by dobies .
negative	therefore only a one star_rating !
negative	from booking this holiday we '_ve been disappointed !
negative	telephoned the day before to ask where to pick_up keys & were told to go beach front to fincas benidorm when we got there that was closed so had phone again & told to go buena vista for keys finally got to apartment 0i in aquarium 000 to find it was dirty & smelled of cigarette_smoke !
negative	phoned number we were given for problems with room which cost 00_euros to be told they couldn_'_t do anything about it that day as they were finishing for the day !
negative	was told we would defiantly get a phone_call the day later but are still_waiting !!!
negative	really spoiled our new year !
negative	!
negative	my boyfriend ordered a surprise bouquet of flowers for a special day as he was away on a business trip .
negative	it arrived the following_day and to make the matter worse , it was left at the door unattended and badly_damaged in torrential_rain and the heavy wind .
negative	it was found soaked and lopsided in the corner of my garage door .
negative	at that stage i knew from my boyfriend that he '_s ordered flowers and he was quite furious about the delay .
negative	he '_s made a complaint for which they responded many days_later stating
negative	hi ,
negative	please_accept our sincere_apologies for the delay in replying .
negative	we request you to contact our head_office on <_external link_removed_> regarding this matter .
negative	regards ,
negative	iflorist
negative	we rang and spoke to the customer service guy_who sounded_like he couldn_'_t care less .
negative	he promised to speak to the boss and ring us back re : refund and unsurprisingly never returned the call .
negative	it left a bad taste in mouth and it totally_ruined what could '_ve been a sweet experience .
negative	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
negative	business is all about the trust .
negative	they lost more than just two customers .
negative	i ordered cottonwood curtains for my patio and bay_windows costing_£ 0 , 000 .
negative	the process was not easy , the sales_team were cold and not customer friendly or helpful ....
negative	i should have heeded my initial instinct .
negative	i did point out at the , time that i did not feel as if i was a valued_customer .
negative	i run two nationwide companies so i know what good customer service is .
negative	i called to cancel after two working_days as the swatch came and the colour said not match the description ..
negative	they said there would be a 00_% charge (£_000 )!!
negative	as the length of cloth had already been cut .
negative	i said ' then i will have the fabric as i had paid for it '.
negative	they insisted that they would still make up the curtains that they will clearly sell on .
negative	so i bought the fabric - they sell on at a profit .
negative	.......
negative	i feel robbed !!
negative	....... £_000 is lot out of my pension for nothing in return .
negative	they have profitted out of me .
negative	disgraceful to the extreme .
negative	on 00th_november i used parcel to go to post a parcel using yodel as the delivery company ( parcel to go and yodel are the same ) it was a 00 hour delivery that cost just under_£_00 . 00
negative	on tuesday the 00th_november i received an_email ( being a business my details were on the label ) from a business in whitechapel london telling_me they had received a parcel address to my customer in essex delivered the their business describing the contents and name and address of the customer the parcel was supposed to go .
negative	i spoke to lauren at parcels to go eventually at 0 . 00pm on the 00th who explained that my parcel was in a depot in vauxhall , after_reading her the email from the person it was delivered to i was told an investigation would be opened the delivery driver would be contacted and an_email had been sent to yodel for them to contact me . i have rang yodel everyday speaking to a different person_who always tell me the same thing parcel at vauxhall someone will contact me to arrange a collection on friday 00nd i told them i was not getting off the phone until a collection had been arranged for my parcel to be picked_up from the wrong_address and be sent to right address .
negative	a collection was arranged for monday 00th i wont go into names and times of calls i contacted the business who has my parcel to check collection had been made on the 00th as my customer still had not received it .
negative	and guess_what it had not been collected .
negative	so again the frustrating act of having to call yodel who spent no time at all telling_me that my problem is with parcel to go and not yodel ( one and the same ) who had been trying to contact me via phone and email ( lies i am housebound and have answer machines on both my house phone and mobile plus email addresses ) after much pushing i eventually got a number to ring parcels to go and spoke to lauren again who informed me that my parcel was at vauxhall depot an investigation would be opened and someone from yodel would call me , i told her i knew that i would not get a call from anyone she gave her word that they would .
negative	( guess_what they never called ) i am now taking_legal_advice and will be issuing both companies with claims for the cost my parcel , my time , cost of my calls and damages to my business .
negative	as well as court costs .
negative	i fail to understand how a parcel can be delivered to an address that is not even on the parcel or in the same county or why it is so hard for that said parcel to be collected and delivered to the correct_address .
negative	avoid yodel and parcels to go at all costs .
negative	but at_least they live up to their name my parcel has defiantly gone .
negative	i do not want to receive any more apologies lies or promises the small_claims court can do my talking .
negative	should not take payments for things you don_'_t have in stock .
negative	on 00th_july was looking for phone for my 00 year_old as he had broken his screen on samsung_s0 , and as hes on contract needed to replace asap , so we looked on cash_converters website , he found a nokia_lumia 000 priced at £_00 , i knew this was incorrect price , so i gave him my card and we paid for it straight_away .
negative	surprise_surprise on monday_morning i get an_email from cash_converters , saying that this phone had been sold in the store over the weekend and the website hadnt been updated .
negative	this was utter bullshit , they realised they had made an_error with the price and wouldnt honour it , so come up with this rubbish about being sold in store .
negative	i emailed them straight back and never_heard from them again .
negative	so wouldnt ever have anything to do with this company again
negative	i called the telephone_number stated after we collected our_luggage on our return_journey and was told the driver would return our car within 00_minutes .
negative	after waiting nearly 00_minutes i called again to see what was happening .
negative	the operator said that i had not previously telephoned and that i must of called the wrong number .
negative	i explained to him that i had used the redial and therefore this confirmed that i had called them .
negative	he said that in any case we had arrived earlier_than stated on the booking .
negative	i suggested that we should have been told if this was going to cause a delay in getting our car back when making the first call .
negative	to my disbelief he still insisted that no called was received .
negative	a driver was then sent with our car 00_minutes later .
negative	i complained to stressfreeparking and the operator was polite and proffessional and said he would contact the car_parking and get back to me .
negative	after chasing for a reply two_days_later i received an_email 0_days after that saying the following .
negative	i did say to the stressfreeparking guy that the car_park concerned should be removed from their site .
negative	" the manager at air parking has advised you did arrive slightly early and even_though every effort was made to collect the vehicle , due to no chauffeur availability the vehicle could not be collected until your specified time .
negative	this should have been advised by the operator and could have avoided the current situation ."
negative	this is a completely_different excuse why our car was not returned after being told it would take 00_minutes .
negative	they have offered a discount when we use them again but there is no chance we ever will .
negative	goods still not received .
negative	ordered goods on 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	it is now 0th_january and still no perfume .
negative	would give no stars if option was available
negative	heartbroken boy on christmas day !
negative	we recently ordered a 0ft walker and simpson pool_table from your company .
negative	as the package arrived in_tact , we had no reason to open it up and inspect it .
negative	as it was a christmas_present for my young son , we didn_'_t open it until christmas day .
negative	imagine the disappointment when our initial inspection revealed a mayjor crack on the underside of the table .
negative	he was devastated !
negative	i phoned customer '_s service and the lack of understanding or sympathy for our plight was astounding !
negative	i was told as we hadn_'_t reported the fault within ' 00_hours ' there was nothing they could do .
negative	i explained it was a christmas_present for my son but i was told that this was company policy and no exceptions were made even for christmas !
negative	i now have to explain to my little_boy that the present he has longed for for months will not be replaced and , as uk_sport imports are refusing to give us a refund for this faulty purchase , we cannot_afford to buy him a new one .
negative	please , please do not buy anything from this dreadful company !
negative	i very much hope that uk sports_imports had a good christmas because ours was completely_ruined !
negative	from very dissatisfied mum ,
negative	karen davies
negative	first the product i ordered was sent to an address that doesn_'_t exist and then although promised i still have no product !
negative	the customer service operator on my first call was rude and unhelpful and on my second call customer_services were helpful and promised a replacement product , that was 0_wks ago and still no product !
negative	top_cash_back are not worth_bothering with they advertise company '_s who don_'_t pay out and all they say is we are looking into this matter or your claim is on ice
negative	should not be giving free advertising and take these rip_off merchant off there site when they don_'_t pay up and they keep getting complaint '_s over and over again regarding the same company '_s
negative	all i can say top_cash_back must be getting very good commission for not having to pay anything out
negative	i ordered two small items and they did come and were what i wanted but i was not aware of the subscription .
negative	it was worded on my order like an advert , nowhwere did it say i was subscribing to anything and i did not agree to them taking any money other than the items i bought .
negative	this has to be illegal .
negative	they even make the total of your goods show up in red so that '_s all you see .
negative	that '_s all they want you to see so they can get away with their scam .
negative	as soon as i realised they had taken money without my consent i cancelled my subscription but they still took more money .
negative	i '_m definitely going down the small courts route .
negative	i ordered a confetti luxury bouquet plus 00_% extra for my mums_birthday next_day guarenteed i will start with did not arrive till 0_days_later what good is that for someones birthday ?
negative	they was dead and there was only 0 stems so if that was 00_% extra god help how many i would have got if not ordered the extra i have been on the phone in total for more than 0 hours and not even spoke to anybody i gave up and emailed them oh_boy did i get a reply we have exchanged 00 emails and all i got was well i can send a bouquet from our seasonal range for tomorrow ( saturday ) but let_me know before 0pm what a joke .
negative	i have informed them that they are breaking the distance_selling regulations and also next_day guarentee contract then i was replied with well i have offered you a new bouquet thats all i can do kind reguards .
negative	i will in future give a family_member who_lives close to my mother to go to florists to buy sum for me i will be staying away from this company and i would advise anybody_else to as well . poor customer service extremely poor attitude and dead flowers and how can they say they can send a bouquet out today to arrive tomorrow if they could not even do it in the first place .
negative	trust me they dont deserve a star u should be able to give minus stars
negative	the tiles i order was of poor quality wrong_colour which if that wasn_'_t bad enough the after sale was even worse and rude and un help full making this something i never started and made me not order of a website again
negative	i used to be a great fan of ri , but this company is turned into one of my most hated and i refuse to give them any more of my money !!
negative	!
negative	i buy clothes for my daughter , nieces and nephews as well as my self and always thought their clothing was of a good standard .
negative	i have just got of the phone to the customer_services department which offers no service at all !!
negative	this is the second order in 0_weeks that has left me in a pickle first my red dress for the office xmas party didn_'_t arrive on time and now i '_m told the 00 items i have ordered for xmas_presents will not probably arrive until the 00th of december ...
negative	fat lot of good that is .
negative	to top it off i ordered them on monday with the confirmation_email_stating delivered by friday 00th_december .
negative	according to jason it has not even been picked yet , 0 working_days and it has not even been picked yet !!!
negative	i can not get a refund , i can not find out when its likely to be dispatched and i can not do anything , not even speak to a manager .
negative	to top it off they were advertising that if you ordered by that date delivery would be before xmas .
negative	all jason could do is tell me about terms and conditions which in all honesty the terms are i pay you deliver by the time you have advised on the confirmation or return my damn money instead of getting interest on my money and ruining my christmas because i will be sitting_around with no presents to give my family .
negative	ironically i received an_email just yesterday 00 / 00 /_0000 at 00 . 00am that says quote on quote ' its not too late !
negative	order before_midnight for christmas delivery ' liars do not order as you wont get it before xmas and you wont_be able to get a refund to replace what you wont get !!!
negative	stay away from this thieving company their delivery is crap and river_island has just lost a customer .
negative	arrrggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
negative	rubbish rubbish rubbish !
negative	i have stopped using my iphone , don_'_t make any calls on it and send maybe a few texts a month .
negative	i have a booster which is a unlimited to other tmobile users yet my bill is always over .
negative	they are ridiculous charge for voicemail service i dont have , they charge £ 0 . 00 one off fees which is erm every_month and no one can explain_why ?
negative	they charge for debit_card payments because i chose not to give them access to my bank ac with dd .
negative	and god_forbid you should be late paying your bill by a few_days they continue to harrass you at all hours even on sunday wether you speak with them or not .
negative	the worst thing i done was change from my old school flex 00 to a shitty i phone contract i have a few_weeks to go and my 00 year relationship with tmobile is over !!!!
negative	woop_woop ........
negative	tmobile cs has just said that repeating my disdain for tmobile is not helpful !
negative	!
negative	so i will repeat it here .
negative	you are rubbish rubbish rubbish bunch of theives who ruin people '_s credit and give absolutely nothing for loyalty to you .
negative	just like british_gas as soon as your momentum gets going you shit on the ' little ' people who help you get there .
negative	disgrace disgrace disgrace no matter_how you change your name your still crap !!
negative	ee ???
negative	dont you mean errant egocentric .......
negative	arrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh
negative	this is the first time i have used this company and rest_assured this will be the last !
negative	!
negative	and i '_d ask people to seriously think_twice before using them .
negative	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
negative	is it about time these types of companies and the courier they use were investigated to see how our valuable packages are actually handled ?
negative	how many_times have you had a package delivered and it '_s been damaged , lost or stolen ?
negative	as for compensation , think again , they '_ll try and wriggle out of any such claim .
negative	i think investigations into these companies are long over due .
negative	ordered flowers for delivery monday .
negative	unbeknown to me they never arrived , tried to track through the website but this service didn_'_t work .
negative	contacted customer service who said they would resend and would upgrade to a large bouquet .
negative	order arrived 0_days late and can what only be described as a small cheap bunch .
negative	i had already questioned if a large bouquet was being sent as the confirmation for the the reorder was
negative	a duplicate of my original order .
negative	i was assured by email a large bouquet was on it '_s way and they were unable to alter the wording on the tracking .
negative	after sending a pic of the flowers they confirmed it actually wasn_'_t a lathe bouquet as promised but would now refund the delivery cost .
negative	this should have been done automatically according to their 000_% customer_satisfaction_guarantee .
negative	so if you want poor flowers , non delivery and broken_promises then feel free to use this company .
negative	have only had a mirrored_chest of drawers from this company 0_months and the front of the drawers have developed stress fractures .
negative	they have hardly been touched yet when we wrote to furniture_market hoping for a replacement , no chance !
negative	oh but they will send the mirrored fronts and we can meet the expense of a glazier to replace them .
negative	i have always maintained , buy cheap pay twice and sadly that has_proved to be the case with this company
negative	ordered ghd_air hairdryer , phoned them and was told city_link would deliver following_day , waited in all day , no delivery , emailed them twice but no reply , day after i emailed them to say due not receiving the item and no communication i was going to contact pay_pal .
negative	i shortly had an_email back to say " due to my rude email they were cancelling my order ".
negative	i telephoned them to say i think i was well within my rights to know where my paid item was and that i was not a rude person , i was then told they actually did not have any in stock and that was why my order was cancelled .
negative	i placed an order for 0 items on 0 april_0000 , it '_s now 00 april & i haven_'_t received my order yet .
negative	customer_services told me it was despatched on 00 april by royal_mail 0nd_class but i will have to wait another week before they will look into it for me .
negative	obviously this says more about royal_mail than healthy_supplies & if they can ensure i receive the items i ordered in the next couple of days i will happily change my review to reflect their assistance but for now i remain an unhappy customer .
negative	my dishwasher_broke_down while under a 0 year parts warranty .
negative	i called the centre for an engineer , i was told an engineer call out was £_000 ?
negative	i confirmed this , as i had a 0 year part warranty and they agreed that was the price .
negative	so , do you really get a 0 year parts warranty ?
negative	i think not !
negative	!
negative	to make_matters worse and that is why i write this review now .
negative	i received an_email from them asking for a review , i submitted it - and it was sent back to me saying , " i had to remove the prices , as it would confuse customers "?
negative	i would never recommend them , ever !
negative	beware of this company , 0 items they sent me were broken , because i had paid for the items and not on account , they were not interested , parcels never arrived , i had to chase_up yodel , as they would not !!!!
negative	rude_unhelpful ..... hanging up on me for asking why they would send out faulty electrical goods .... i have never ever_encountered such rudeness and nastiness from a company , go and learn some customer service skills from amazon !!!
negative	would never shop_here again .... disgraceful !
negative	wont answer emails , worst shopping_experience ever !
negative	do not use this company , disgusting rip_off !!!!!
negative	reduced offer from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 .... this company is a scam , do not use !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	they are thieves , steal your phone and give you nothing , please_beware do not use !!!!!!!
negative	worst experience ever !!!!
negative	!
negative	i recently ordered snugs extra padded heel grips which cannot be bought in local_shops and appear to be just what i need ( thus_far untried ).
negative	however , the cost of the item was £ 0 . 00 .
negative	the p_&_p was £ 0 . 00 , which i had not spotted at the point of order .
negative	the heel grips arrived via the postman in a small envelope .
negative	enough said !
negative	the flowers arrived in a crushed box , heads off some of the flowers and i have tried 0 times to contact serenata_flowers to be sent a message i cannot open .
negative	i will never use them again and the case is on going with photographs to prove .
negative	interesting to see if this message is published in full , i have copied and pasted it for future contact
negative	someone_else '_s parcel was delivered to me , then picked_up again .
negative	still no sign of my parcel .
negative	three_weeks before a friend '_s wedding day , i ordered some flowers from iflorist to be delivered in the us .
negative	i was informed that they could not deliver on the day , a saturday , so i accepted the delivery to be done the day before .
negative	iflorist then confirmed my order for friday december 00th .
negative	imagine my dismay when on friday december 00th i received an_email from iflorist informing_me that they were not able to deliver my order before january 0th !
negative	they offered to enclose an_apology with the delivery and offered me a £ 0 credit towards a future order as compensation .
negative	i then emailed my friend to ask if she would be at home on january 0th .
negative	which she confirmed she would be .
negative	imagine my disgust when i received an_email from my friend to tell me that she had waited in the whole day and had received a phone_call from " in full_bloom _ park city " early that evening informing her that they would deliver her flowers that evening .
negative	my friend explained that she was going out and was then rudely_told that it was up to her but they could always cancel the order , which my friend then promptly did .
negative	what was supposed to be a nice_surprise on a wedding day ended_up causing disappointment , frustration and outright fury !
negative	it is a long time since i have felt so angry !
negative	it goes without saying that i will never ever use iflorist again !
negative	i ordered 0 seperate_orders .
negative	first one had very few flowers and no message to say who they were from .
negative	0 order was not delivered .
negative	the other 0 had very few flowers .
negative	i would have been better going to tesco or asda .
negative	trying to get in touch with these people is like trying to get in touch with god but then again he answers sometimes disgraceful customer service wish_id never joined them
negative	both_times that i have ordered with misguided there have been problems with delivery .
negative	one parcel which totaled c .£ 000 never arrived and i was left out of pocket .
negative	the second time misguided never gave the correct_address , missing out the building name and my parcel never arrived on the next_day delivery , after this i was told there was nothing they could do and had to wait_until monday for it to be delivered at which point was too late .
negative	this was all done over email which although you have an audit trail is very frustrating as you cannot_speak to someone over the phone and get the matter dealt_with quickly .
negative	they do not take any responsibility or understand the frustrations therefore it is clear to understand that i will not be placing any further orders with misguided nor are my friends .
negative	i agree with everyone else sizes always out and poor poor quality clothing
negative	the flowers were lovely when they where delivered lucly my friends husband came home from work and found them ouside on the doorstep my friend said nobody rang the bell . also they where lovely but after 0_days they started to die off so im not not to happy with the delivery and how long the flowers lasted .
negative	linda steele
negative	trusting the sales_pitch on the eflorist website i placed an order for next_day delivery for my sister - in - laws_birthday .
negative	what the site fails to mention is that eflorist may accept your order but actually your flowers will only be delivered if they can then find a local_florist to fulfil the order .
negative	i found out at 0pm on the day of the birthday that in my case they couldn_'_t .
negative	if i known this was how they operated i would have gone_elsewhere , or even if i had found out earlier in the day i could have gone_elsewhere sooner !
negative	go elsewhere i did later that evening and the next_day my sister - in - law received a lovely bunch of flowers .
negative	see eflorist there are florists in her area who will deliver at short_notice !
negative	oh and just to make my experience all the more fabulous the eflorist customer service team twice cut me off whilst discussing their lack of delivery meaning i had to call them back .
negative	no flower delivery and the customer gets to pay for the telephone_call explaining why .
negative	now that '_s what eflorist should say on their website , it would in my experience be more honest !
negative	good idea , too hard to use - links didn_'_t work .
negative	will avoid in future
negative	they kept saying there was a problem with my repeat_prescription and that they had to phone my vet .
negative	there was no problem with it , but it took then 00 days to phone .
negative	i '_d been telling them for over a week that we '_d run_out of painkillers for my dog and we needed more urgently because she was suffering , but still nothing was done .
negative	it was finally sorted on a friday_morning and the vet promised the painkillers would be posted 0st_class that day as it was so urgent - he said if it was sent by courier it wouldn_'_t be delivered until the following_tuesday as monday was the may bank_holiday .
negative	but he lied , they weren_'_t sent 0st_class_post they were sent by courier , knowing full well it would be yet another 0_days till we got them and another 0_days for my 00 - year_old dog to suffer !
negative	so on the 0th do december requested my iphone 0 to be unlocked so i could use my
negative	work sim .
negative	i got told on the phone this will be done in 00 days ..
negative	so i paid the fee
negative	so far so good .
negative	a week_later i received a text stating my imei_number was incorrect
negative	i was sure this was a mistake as i read the imei_number directly off my phone anyway
negative	phoned up and i was told to ignore the text and that they only needed a few details
negative	of the make and model of the phone so i happily gave this information .
negative	i called on the
negative	00th_dec saturday and the advisor on the phone said my unlock_code will be sent to
negative	me on a 00th_dec tuesday woohoo i thought .. very wonderful and fast .
negative	tuesday came no text so i phoned again ., this time i was told over the phone that my phone was stolen .
negative	and it could not be unlocked .. urm huh ?
negative	i was shocked my phone was bought from new so i challenged the rep over the phone and he finally said he would get back to me in 00_hours .. hmm u guessed it no call was returned so i called again and this time i was told the delay was solely due to the fault of apple and that i was told the unlock_code will take 00 days so i should be patient okay i said i understood that but i was basically told by a previous advisor that the code was going to be sent on a specific date and was also told that my phone was stolen so got a bit_worried .
negative	anyway 00 days was up on the 00th so i phoned up again this time spoke to a manager who told he was going to call me on the 00th with the unlock_code
negative	hmm u guessed it no such call has_been received so just called again before writing this review this time i have been told to wait indefinitely as t mobile can only
negative	request apple to unlock the phone and it '_s up to apple so basically i can be waiting
negative	for eternity for this .
negative	so basically paid money for a service that was meant to take
negative	00 days now is more like unlimited days .. this is no way to conduct_business not
negative	surprised ee was voted worst mobile provider off 0000 .. really angry .
negative	unlock my phone !
negative	i have had positive_experiences with wowcher in the past .
negative	however these have been transactions where i have had no_problems .
negative	i recently ordered a wowcher for an item of clothing over a month_ago .
negative	the retailer sold out of items in my size , and now advise that the item is now discontinued .
negative	the retailer advised i needed to speak with wowcher as the original transaction .
negative	i have now made a number of phone_calls and responded to an_email which has now probably cost me the price of the wowcher again !
negative	no one seems to want to take_responsibility for this and i '_ve effectively paid for something i can '_t have !
negative	i bought tickets to see the script on friday 00nd_march as a christmas_present .
negative	it '_s now 0pm on thursday 00st_march and i am ticketless .
negative	i called viagogo this afternoon who confirmed with ups that the tickets would be delivered to my home address before 0pm this evening .
negative	i '_ve waited in and cancelled dinner with friends but guess_what , no ups van has arrived at my door .
negative	i am leaving for london at 00am tomorrow and unless the tickets arrive before then , i guess i '_ll be missing the concert .
negative	very , very upsetting .
negative	i will never use viagogo again .
negative	it '_s a totally_unreliable service .
negative	0 : 00 on 00 / 00 : they have arrived but i have had to take time off work this morning to wait for them .
negative	what a farce .
negative	i booked a ticket for £ 0 . 00 on the 00th of november .
negative	however , once i '_d paid , the confirmation_email said that the ticket was valid for the 00th of december .
negative	i was then accused off ' booking the ticket incorrectly ' by an abhorrently rude customer adviser , so i took a screenshot of the date and price of the train_ticket as advertised on the trainline app .
negative	i finally_managed to get a phone_call from a supervisor who acknowledged that there had been an_error on the app .
negative	he agreed that it wasn_'_t my fault that the trainline had made an_error and advertised a train_ticket for the wrong date .
negative	however , he said that there was nothing he could do to help as these tickets are non - refundable .
negative	absolutely_disgraceful .
negative	he then shouted down the phone as he read me the terms and conditions of a ticket which i did not want !
negative	my only other option would have been to book a ticket for £_00 , thus paying the £_00 difference as well as a £_00 changing fee .
negative	i did not cause this mistake , so why am i paying for it to be fixed !?
negative	why on earth should i pay the trainline for making a mistake ?
negative	it '_s honestly beyond_belief .
negative	i understand that tickets are non - refundable , but , if the trainline are responsible for false_advertising , they should take_responsibility and refund the ticket .
negative	i am a loyal_customer of the trainline .
negative	i book with them on a monthly_basis , and they would definitely have made more money by refunding the £ 0 . 00 they stole from me than losing my custom .
negative	absolutely_shocking , disgusting , and probably illegal .
negative	i will definitely be taking this further .
negative	i spent my first day at university waiting four hours for a delivery .
negative	i had specifically booked a time and date for the delivery to come so that i would have all the essential items i needed .
negative	i phoned customer_services who told me that ' the driver wasn_'_t going to come '.
negative	nobody phoned me to tell me that the driver wasn_'_t coming , so i wasted a whole day waiting in the lobby of my accommodation .
negative	asda didn_'_t give me a reason for the lack of delivery and said there was nothing they could do .
negative	i explained that i had just arrived in a new city and had no duvet , pillows , bedsheets , cooking_equipment or towels .
negative	the lady i spoke to was rude , lacked empathy and literally asked , ' what do you want me to do ?
negative	'.
negative	i have never_experienced_such awful service in my entire life .
negative	i am not one for writing_reviews , but i have never felt so stressed and upset .
negative	asda didn_'_t even have the decency to tell me that my items weren_'_t going to arrive .
negative	they didn_'_t even understand their obligation ( and obvious ability as a multimillion pound company ) to provide the service which i had paid for : to get my items which i had paid for on the day i was promised .
negative	really terrible experience .
negative	do not use unless you want stress , hassle , and to rack up a huge phone bill trying to get answers out of badly trained , useless customer service assistants .
negative	placed two orders , and on both_occassions part of the order was missing and detailed as to follow .
negative	a refund was requested in the absence of the product , but beautybay failed to respond to emails .
negative	won_'_t be buying from them again , and certainly wouldn_'_t recommend at all .
negative	after an operation the previous week , i wanted to send my mother a nice bunch of flowers to say thank_you .
negative	i was on the phone to her on the day of delivery and received the text_confirming the delivery , whilst on the phone to said recipient .
negative	funny how she didn_'_t hear the doorbell when she was on the phone to me at the time .
negative	i contacted serentata and said that there had been a mistake , to which they responded with " we have confirmed the delivery and signature of acceptance ".
negative	after complaining some more they apologized and said they would resend or refund me .
negative	i then get a phone_call from my mum saying that the flowers had been dumped on the doorstep or next door and had been sitting_outside in the rain for two_days .
negative	shockingly enough , the delivery driver had actually forged the signature .
negative	however , they have been good since and given me an extra £ 0 to order a new bouquet for my mum .
negative	due for delivery on tuesday .
negative	ordered 0 bracelets online and was told they would be available to pick them up today at my local waitrose store ' after 0 pm '.
negative	00_mins before i was due to collect them ... as i was on my way there , i receive an_email_saying they won_'_t be available to collect and they will text me when they are .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable to me .
negative	how can they just give 00_mins notice ?
negative	i '_ve been inconvenienced already and now i have to wait for them to tell me when they are ready !
negative	i think they are out of stock but still took my money ...
negative	it my first time using john_lewis online ... i won_'_t be using them again .
negative	used these twice_now and both_times the claim items are missing , my partner and i checked everyone of the items and they were all there .
negative	it just so happens it '_s the higher value items seem to be missing .
negative	my first order i sent a box set , they claim a disc was missing ( even_though i '_d checked them all ) so gave_me nothing , their policy_states they won_'_t send back items or allow you to dispute them so you have to just accept it .
negative	thought we '_d give them a second chance with another order - same problems again .
negative	also we got payment via bank_transfer even this is slow , after sending an_email_saying payment has_been sent and would take 0 working_days the 0st order took 0 working_days and i even emailed customer service but got no response , the second order is currently at 0 working_days at is not yet been received .
negative	who takes 0 working_days for bank_transfer these days anyway .
negative	so overall disppointing , a good way to declutter if your not too bothered about making money on your items .
negative	we won_'_t use again .
negative	side note - this company is deliberately blocking negative_reviews to boost there positive_feedback .
negative	i '_ve send in proof of purchase but still under investigation by their customer service - notice how non of the positive_reviews get blocked / investigated .
negative	steer_clear of this company .
negative	so i had two parcels that needed collecting and delivering .
negative	so i used city_link .
negative	they sent the shipping labels and i attached them to the packages .
negative	it was a next_day service so they picked_up and then delivered the next_day as expected .
negative	they even sent me and email and text to say the parcel was delivered - excellent !
negative	or so i thought .
negative	i then discover that the had some mixed up the parcels and delivered both to the wrong_address .
negative	how is this possible - their shipping label was attached to each parcel - but they ignored this and sent them both to the opposite address .
negative	i '_m fuming now - one of the items is a £_000 lens .
negative	luckily both the people who received the parcels were understanding , helpful and honest .
negative	i contacted city_link they appologied then said they would re - collect the parcels and deliver them to the correct destination .
negative	not ideal but i guess at_least they trying to reticfy the problem .
negative	but guess where they tried to collect the parcel from - the original collection_point !
negative	i mean are these people for real ?
negative	it '_s like a bad comedy show .
negative	i '_ve actually got my partner to pick_up the parcels and deliver them himself so that the high value parcels get to their destinations .
negative	considering we live in telford and they were going to middlesex - this is really inconvient .
negative	on top of that city_link won_'_t refund the postage because and i quote ' we delivered the parcels on time ' obviously their t '_s and c '_s don_'_t state that they actually have to deliver the parcels to their intended destinations .
negative	i won_'_t ever be using city_link again .
negative	i mean i '_m_sure if you wanted to post an item and it end up at completely the wrong_address then they are great .
negative	it '_s like a big game of pass the parcel when it arrives it '_s a surprise to see what you have actually received .
negative	but it '_s unlikely to be what your expecting !
negative	oh and it may also be soaking_wet like one of our parcels - i think they thought having fragile written across it mean they should throw it in a river and try to fish it out again .
negative	so many big chain companies have fallen recently , how are bhs not one of them .
negative	their customer service is truly shocking .
negative	i placed an order on - line , got an_email_confirmation and i though that was it .
negative	a few_days_later i noticed i '_d been refunded for my purchase .
negative	so i logged on to my bhs account only to find they had cancelled my order due to ' item no_longer available ' no - one bothered to contact me to inform_me of this .
negative	so i send an_email to their customer service - which has_been ignored , so i logged on to their facebook_page and sent a message their - also ignored .
negative	a simple email or phone_call was all i expected to inform_me that they could not full - fill my order but they don_'_t seem to respect their customers enough even to do this .
negative	i '_ve always admired bhs having shopped in their stores frequently , this was my first on - line order with them and it is also my last ever purchase at bhs .
negative	i '_m british , my family live in england but i live in the states .
negative	i wanted to do something special for my mum '_s birthday because i couldn_'_t be there and i figured interflora would be a safe bet ... wrong !
negative	when she got them some of the flowers were dead , some had literally grown fur and mould , she had to through them straight out because they smelt so bad being that they were rotting !
negative	needless to say she was disappointed and i was gutted .
negative	never using interflora again !
negative	' very ' sent me an_email with a code for £_00 off , redeemed the code and got no discount , turns_out the discount comes off my next order , the email said nothing about that and implied that it was for my current order .
negative	took_advantage of a ' 0 for 0 ' on tops offer , only came to £_00 total for 0 tops .. oh plus £ 0 . 00 delivery .. only 0 tops came as the other was out of stock .. two_weeks_later the other top turned_up , charged me another £ 0 . 00 for delivery and tried to charge me another £ 0 for the top , argued it and they knocked the £ 0 off like they should ( esp as the promotion is still running !)
negative	but still got charged the £ 0 . 00 !
negative	so in the end payed £ 0 delivery which was the price of one of the so - called ' free tops '!
negative	used a buy now pay next year code , tried to pay it off they said i have to wait_until the following month , following month i tried and i '_m charged interest .
negative	when trying to order by phone they keep trying to sell you other items , even if you say you don_'_t want anything_else they still try to pressure you into their overpriced junk !
negative	they ' re always phoning to tell me about their awful promotions that i do not care about , i ask them not to but next_day i '_ll get the same call from another person .
negative	delivery costs far too much , esp when it takes a week to get here , i live in a main city not out in the country or anything like that so i have no idea why it takes so long .
negative	very . co . uk has put me off using any other catalogue , they are awful .
negative	i '_d heard of the site so assumed i '_d be fine using it , wasn_'_t until after i placed my order that i even thought to read a review , found loads of bad ones and a few good ones , but seeing as how i already ordered thought i could be one of the lucky ones and get my stuff .
negative	my order status changed the following_day , thought my order is coming , few_days_later get an_email_saying they arnt sending either of my items and to contact them .... but also they will keep trying to get_hold of one and not to contact them for 00 days ?
negative	wth ?
negative	just googling the top line of my email got me loads of people with the same problem , site seems happy enough to take your money but they don_'_t have any of the items instock despite saying so !
negative	used this site for the sake of saving £ 0 , not worth the hassle at all .
negative	avoid website and stick to one you can_trust .
negative	booked a hotel and transfer with alpha_rooms , there was a problem with the website and it did not confirm transfer , tried to book again and it took my payment 0 times .
negative	have phoned twice , emailed 0 times and still they have not refunded by payment 0_days_later .
negative	how do you get through to these people i am demented .
negative	i waited for my package over 0_months ...
negative	it never came .
negative	it got lost .
negative	and that i know is not beautybays fault , but they never answerd my emails .
negative	i had to call twice and pay a lot for that ... and when the product i orderd that i wanted was no_longer in stock , they didn_'_t give me anything as a apology .....
negative	will not be ordering from natures_best again .
negative	twelve days after ordering item has not been received and apparently i have to wait_until 00th_april some 00 days_later until they will replace my order - appalling customer service
negative	i have had a horrendous_experience with talktalk !
negative	there is no customer service - and if you decide to ' escalate your complaint to the ceo '_s office ' - the manner of the manager who eventually telephones you , beggars_belief !
negative	i took out a telephone , broadband and tv contract .
negative	the engineer came out on the friday to install the line .
negative	no one had mentioned to me that i would not get my broadband until the following_monday until i tried to contact them , and got an_automated_message giving me the bad_news .
negative	and try as i might to make contact with a human_being , i failed woefully , as each time i quoted my new number upon request , i was told to wait_until monday !
negative	once the broadband was up and running the speed fluctuated below what was promised and stopped continuously .
negative	a call_centre manager confirmed this , and although he raised the speed for me , within the conversation time with him , it fell again .
negative	i had been promised the speed wouldn_'_t fall below 0 mb , but it did .
negative	and i begun to wonder_why i had allowed myselkf to be lured by talktalk adverts to change providers .
negative	after nothing improved by end of second week i said i wanted to ' escalate my complaint '.
negative	an engineer was booked to come out , to check for problems - and to install my youview_box because the fact that i hadn_'_t connected it i was told was one of my problems with speed .
negative	(?!
negative	) something to do with an ' automated manager ' that took over until the connection .
negative	( i hadn_'_t installed my youview_box because i '_m of the older_generation , not a techi in any way , and i was waiting for my daugther to do the honours !)
negative	the engineer did not arrive on the date arranged .
negative	an_hour and a half later i got a phone_call from the subcontracting company saying he had been sent by talktalk to an address in carlisle !
negative	a second engineer was booked for the following_day and when he arrived he had not been told what he had to do apart_from ' service tv ' - and he showed me that information that he '_d been sent on his gadget .
negative	when i said there was nothing wrong with my tv but he needed to check the broadband_speed and install my youview_box he refused the latter point_blank .
negative	he said talktalk always did this and he hadn_'_t been given this instruction so he wasn_'_t doing it .
negative	( remember i had been told by a manager that installing the box would inprove my speed , so the engineer would do it !)
negative	try as i might to contact a manager , while the engineer was there failed , with various excuses .
negative	the engineer left doing nothing and i decided to cancel my contract .
negative	i have left out the details of so many unsatisfactory , unhelpful calls to call_centres abroad and in the uk , and several letters with no adequate responses .
negative	the bottom line is talktalk staff don_'_t give a %!!
negative	*&+@ about their customers , or their company '_s reputation .
negative	they believe they ' re big enough to ride the storms .
negative	they can put it down in an advert , but they ' re not interested enough to listen when something_goes_wrong , and to honestly endeavour to sort it out .
negative	i knew i could be liable for early cancellation_fees but my experience to date had so sincerely stressed me , not getting through to anyone who seemed to be able to at_least appear to know what needed doing as a next step , and to do it .
negative	the ombudsman '_s service took up my case but unfortunately , talktalk were able to refer to the small_print of the contract , refuting several facts that i know occurred , but they denied .
negative	a derisory £_00 was knocked_off my total bill , with a letter of apology that '_s supposed to be on the way .
negative	i '_m having to pay £_000 for deciding to put an end to the misery i was experiencing with talktalk , when there was zero prospect of things improving , and my sanity was at stake !
negative	be warned !
negative	if you dare take out a contract with talktalk and there are any_problems - you are on a one way ticket to stressville , and talktalk won_'_t give a jot .
negative	i wouldn_'_t wish my experience on anyone .
negative	i realise things go_wrong .
negative	that '_s not the issue .
negative	the issue is somone having the willingness , authority and sense of responsibility to constructively work with the customer to sort the problem out .
negative	.
negative	when i ordered the goods i was told a 0 - 0 day delivery so considering i ordered the goods on a sunday i was expecting the goods to arrive friday at the latest .
negative	on tuesday i contacted sport and leisure_uk and asked them when the goods would be arriving because of the line of work i do i needed to know what day to not make any appointments .
negative	i was told it would be with me on friday and i would receive an_email thursday_night with my delivery details .
negative	thursday_night came and went and nothing .
negative	friday i contacted them again by phone ( their hold tune drives you nuts aswell ) they informed me that the goods had not been loaded_onto the vehicle for that day because they had no space left !!
negative	i explained that i had lost a days earnings because i had cancelled all my appointments and my boss was not happy because i was not out getting new sales in .
negative	they didnt care and tried to tell me that if i wanted my treadmill delivered on monday i would have to pay for the service .
negative	this i thought was disgusting as this was there mess up not mine and after demanding to speak to the manager ( who did not start until 00 . 00 am ) they told me they would get her to phone me back before 00 . 00 .
negative	this did not happen so at 00 . 00 i phoned them , after 00_minutes of being on hold i was then told that the manager was in a meeting but they will be sending my treadmill out that day so i would get it on monday and would not be charged the delivery .
negative	monday i contacted them to see what time it would arrive and was told it would be delivered by highway couriers and they would phone me within 00_minutes with an_eta .
negative	00_minutes later i had a phone_call saying no sorry its not coming with highway couriers its coming with torr distributions and they gave_me the number to call to get an_eta .
negative	when i phoned torrs they told me they was not delivering the treadmill that day because they had been told by sport leisure to contact me that day to arrive a suitable day to deliver that week .
negative	i explained the situation to them and they had to have authority from sport leisure to deliver it so i had to then phone sports leisure back up .
negative	i was so angry at this point .
negative	another day of missed appointments at work because of the fiasco they had caused .
negative	sports leisure denied all knowledge of this and said they would get it delivered that day .
negative	i contacted torrs again half an_hour later to only be told that my treadmill had only been sat at a depot only 00_minutes away from my home since saturday_morning .
negative	i could of picked this up myself if i had had some kind of communication from someone .
negative	i gave up with sports leisure and contacted the local delivering depot directly and because i am an executive in a parcel carrier company i know the local companies and explained the situation to them and they kindly delivered the goods that afternoon .
negative	i have never had such a disgusting service like this ever .
negative	no communication , the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing and the whole attitude of a manager who could not be bothered to contact me throughout the whole_process .
negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone nor will i be purchasing anything from them again .
negative	i just hope that my treadmill does not breakdown as i do not bear to think about the problems i would have trying to get it repaired or replaced .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for a call to let_me know what is happening
negative	i am only rating one star because i have to rate this company .
negative	i am now waiting before i commence legal_action_against this company and have served them notice .
negative	the complaints and after sales_team do not know the meaning of customer service .
negative	my bed developed a fault contacted them and they admitted it said they would contact the supplier i could make a mattress quicker .
negative	no attempt by the company to resolve so i will definitely resort to legal_action if they don_'_t sort it by the date i have given them .
negative	i have a ct scan on monday thanks to this brilliant company .
negative	today i have finally taken delivery of an electric recliner_chair , for my grandmother .
negative	order number .
negative	******* dated .
negative	00 / 00
negative	i am so so disappointed in the service received from your company , that i am also
negative	very angry .
negative	when i first enquired_about the chair , i was told if i ordered by 0 . pm that day , i would
negative	have delivery fri / mon .. as you can see today is thurs , after i had paid for the goods , and checked on the
negative	fri about delivery as i needed to be there to let driver in , i was told , that under no circumstances would the chair be
negative	taken into the premises , and that i would not be given a date , let_alone an est time of arrival .
negative	after sitting there
negative	for just under 0 hrs today , having_spoken the transport company 0 times a lorry finally arrived at the far end of the road .
negative	driver then told me that he could go no further , as his_lorry was too_big , yes it was ... surely to god when you sell your items ,
negative	you are aware that probably the majority of your customers are either disabled , or elderly , so how on earth do you expect them to get
negative	the goods inside , luckily we have a garage , and after the poor driver had managed to unload , he then had to drag the chair the full_length
negative	of a long road , on a pallet truck it is now sat in there .
negative	your prices may be cheaper , but your customer service is incredible , or sorry total_lack of i should say .
negative	i was only assisted once from
negative	someone in your company , who actually did return my call on mon , and told me the name of the transport company , i was then contacted by
negative	a different company , who the goods had then been passed to .
negative	this is a disgrace ..
negative	as a seller more often than a buyer i found that paypal are the worst company i have ever dealt_with !
negative	they barely operate inside uk trading & financial law & freeze customer '_s account for no reason so they can make a few extra millioin £ s profit from their customer '_s money !
negative	they always side with the buyer as it is cheaper for them to do this , even if the ' buyer ' is a repeated and known scammer & you can prove they ' re lying !
negative	the only_reason they get away with this & are not on watchdog every week (!)
negative	is ' cos they don_'_t tend to rip_off ' customers ' only retailers who have little or no recourse that does not involve costly litigation .
negative	they have even ripped_off several charity websites ( the hurricane katrina site is one ) who , by their nature receive a lot of funds very
negative	quickly .
negative	they freeze / limit the charity '_s account , the charity end up refunding the donor '_s money so they can donate to the charity in an_alternative way and paypal , god_bless ' em keep the reversal fees !
negative	from a charity !
negative	not a company i shall deal with again no matter_how easy they make purchasing on - line .
negative	principles have to take precedence over convenience surely ?
negative	!
negative	they broke my son '_d buggy and it has taken months to recover the money from them .
negative	each_step of the process seems to have a different method of communication - you have to report it in person at the airport , then fill in an online form then you get a noreply email_telling you to send a fax , then a letter saying they plan to pay you , but no cheque and so it goes on !
negative	they go out of their way to make themselves difficult to contact eg by fax - who uses fax these days ?
negative	they won_'_t let you board early with a young_child unless you have paid_extra and even if you have the right baggage weight_limit , they won_'_t let you board if it isn_'_t split between the right number of bags !
negative	i will never fly with them again - i would rather walk !
negative	this was my first time with you shopping and my last , i received a perfume boxed and sealed and when opened was only half full , was not even offered a replacement
negative	ordered juicy_couture .
negative	questioned if it was genuine due to poor quality of bottle .
negative	viva la juicy normally comes in a very ornate bottle - this wasnt which automatically raised my concerns
negative	do not buy anything at infurn .
negative	very bad customer service .
negative	no responding to e_-_mails asking for the parcels arrivel and explanations for delaying things .
negative	it is incredible that they are cheating on you .
negative	it is fake .
negative	big waste of money and no respect for other people .
negative	i carn ´_t recommend them at all .
negative	they don_'_t tell you that what you see as charges are for a ' pre_- order ' and when they finally get around to telling you what it will cost , and it shows for t - mobile £_00 . 00 - but when several days_later ( major delay ) they come_back they want another payment of £_00 !
negative	this is exorbitant - compared to [_link ], which charges £_00 , or any high_street firm .
negative	if you try to contact them by phone they leave you hanging ( twice more than 00_minutes , with no answer either time ) and you are paying charges for the phone_call ... they keep_repeating ' we value your call ' and i bet they really do - they ' re earning_money on it !
negative	my husband ordered a bouquet of flowers as a birthday surprise and indeed it was a surprise but not a good one !
negative	as the date he requested for delivery fell on a bank_holiday , prestige_flowers in their wisdom decided to deliver 0_days early without even checking that this was ok . well , it wasn_'_t as we were away on the day the company decided to deliver and so the flowers had to be taken to the local royal_mail delivery office where they had to stay for 0_days because of the bank_holiday and the limited opening_hours of our local office .
negative	needless to say , by the time i collected them they were all dead .
negative	on contacting the company , my husband was told that it was in their small_print that flowers could be delivered on an_alternative date if the company so decided and that a refund was out of the question .
negative	shocking service to say the least but judging_by other comments on this site , prestige_flowers won_'_t be the slightest bit bothered that they spoilt my birthday surprise .
negative	brian was the chap i spoke to .
negative	useless to say the least .
negative	ordered airbed on 00th_june was told would arrive within 00 days , today being the 00th day i know something was wrong so i called for an_eta was told by what sounded_like an_idiot that it had not left the depot and he would look into this and call me back .
negative	he took my number and also relayed it back to me to make_sure it was correct .
negative	no called received so i called again an spoke to brian , eh then said someone tried to call me but could not get answer to which i told him was pure lies and also told about the convo earlier .
negative	he then said item out of stock and it was an_error .
negative	yes i was very angry and made sure they new it .
negative	i was then passed through to customer_services and spoke to a louise hill who said she would issue full issue while i was on the phone and it would show up in my bank within 0_days .
negative	i am_currently_awaiting an_email from her as i type this with confirmation .
negative	if no payment is received i will taking matters furthers and and i will get this shocking company closed_down for good .
negative	had blinds before from them and they were great , i wanted a small roller_blind for the downstairs_loo , it turned_up , flaws in the fabric , doesn_'_t even roll straight and is a dreadful fit .
negative	emailed company twice , zero response .
negative	blind is useless abd ruined the look of the room - never again .
negative	i placed an order and all looked good .
negative	it did not arrive and rather_than rectify the situation themselves when i complained i was given a tracking_number for my parcel .
negative	the tracking page was incomprehensible and all i could i make out was that a notice of attempted delivery had been put through my door and the parcel no_longer needed to be signed for .
negative	the parcel itself would have easily fitted through the letterbox and nothing was ever received .
negative	i contacted wally '_s gifts again and matthew ( the only name i have been provided with ) offered a replacement item and refund .
negative	when this did not happen paypal were blamed for the lack of a refund and there has_been no explanation why the new item has not arrived .
negative	this has_been a truly miserable and unsatisfying experience .
negative	do not order from wally '_s gifts if you expect to get the item you paid for .
negative	do not buy from this supplier - products ordered several weeks_ago have not arrived , with no email explaining delay
negative	i recently ordered two tickets for the wanted through see tickets .
negative	i got these tickets on wednesday using a presale code .
negative	the tickets i got were for the nottingham arena show on 0st april_0000 .
negative	my original seat_allocation for these tickets were block 0 row a and seats 0 and 0 .
negative	on friday_afternoon however i got an_email from see tickets saying that due to production change my seats have been reallocated to block 0 row n which is quite high up .
negative	so i phoned see tickets to see why the seats been changed and they said due to production changes for example stage layout which is out of there control the only_thing they could offer me was a refund .
negative	i took see tickets up on this offer hoping that i would be able to get better seats in the general sale on the saturday as don_'_t like sitting to high up .
negative	anyway this morning i got up in time for general sale and the good news is i managed to get seats for block 0 row a seats 00 and 00 which i am satisfied with .
negative	what happened next disgusted me the most .
negative	i decided to have a look at see tickets site this afternoon only to find that the original seats i got ( which i couldn_'_t have because of ' production change ') were back on sale on there site but at a higher price .
negative	i did a screen_shot of these tickets being back on site which i '_ve attached on this email .
negative	i also have the email of confirmation of the original seat booking and also the reallocation email .
negative	i am very upset with the stress see tickets have put me through just to what seems to me get more money out of the tickets there selling .
negative	i ordered a pair of headphones of the site .
negative	after i received the headphones i discovered that they didn_'_t work .
negative	so i emailed wowcher and the advised that i needed to contact the supplier ' chimp electronics ' so i emailed the seller about the faulty pair .
negative	a day later they emailed me back advising that they '_ll send another pair if i supply them with an address so i sent them an_email with my address .
negative	a week_later i still had not received the new pair so i sent another email to which they replied_saying they haven_'_t received my address so i resent the email with my address .
negative	after another week and still no headphones i sent another email to which they didn_'_t reply to for a few_days .
negative	so i emailed wowcher it '_s self who haven_'_t even replied to me .
negative	chimp electronics did eventually reply_saying they '_ve sent the replacement pair but will send out another pair this was 0_days ago and i '_m still_waiting and i reckon i never will see a working pair of headphones or see my money .
negative	after saying they were dealing_with a company who was taking 0_months to pay cashback - they then refused to ensure payment as promised .
negative	after point_blank refusing to help in any way , ignoring my pointing_out how they '_d said they were resolving it ... it had been paid anyway .
negative	previous customer service used to be excellent , but this experience was a big let_down .
negative	i would give it no stars if i could !
negative	wrong order and no customer service .
negative	i have paid and received the wrong_colour of powder .
negative	rubbish service .
negative	my sister put an order in for an easter_egg to be sent to me , i didnt find out about this till a month after easter when my sister asked me what i thought of it and my reply was ' what easter_egg ?'.
negative	it turns_out the courier service was to blame and their courier didnt even seem to know where he had delivered it !
negative	he repeatedly changed his story saying he had , then he didnt know , and he didnt even get a signature so we have no idea who ended_up with the gift .
negative	my sister then contacted thorntons to ask them for a replacement or a refund , and the cheeky bugger tried to worm their way out of it !
negative	my sister eventually got her refund after many snotty emails and an eventual threat to get their amazon store taken down .
negative	never ordering from them again , hotel_chocolat on the other hand were excellent .
negative	after ordering on thursday before mothers_day my mum still has not recieved her bouqet six days on !
negative	after trying all day to get_hold of someone finally they refused to help saying they couldnt offer a refund and if the flowers still didnt turn_up they would resend them .
negative	i paid_extra for a sunday delivery also .
negative	i wanted to talk to a supervisor and was told no one else could help mke after sending emails i still have not had an_apology or refund or any flowers
negative	i wouldnt even give them half a star !
negative	poor_excuse for a company !
negative	have now recieved an_email from some rep called jamie after a week of getting no where .
negative	prestige_flowers have blamed royal_mail but still cant tell me where my flowers are . was advised they could send another bouquet and a £ 0 . 00 voucher fpr next time !
negative	pah next time !
negative	i have been advised by trading standads that as they have breached their contract to deliver the said flowers on the said day i should write and request a full_refund .
negative	i have emailed them to inform them but surprise_surprise heard_nothing again from them .
negative	i have also contacted_watchdog and explained the situation > please report them if you are disappointed with the service , so we can stop another family_members day being ruined !!
negative	!
negative	came damaged left on the doorstep with no card !!
negative	then when i looked at emails from them it said signed for by someone called brooks at my neighbours address , !!!!
negative	my neighbour is my daughter who was out at work all day and she is not called brooks nor is anyone_else on my street .
negative	shocking service well disappointed .
negative	bought a pressure_washer through_groupon , and it arrived promptly and everything was working well .
negative	after using the washer 0 times the gun split and i could no_longer use .
negative	i emailed ask to get a replacement but was told that physical damage was not their responsibility .
negative	i then have been sitting on the phone daily to speak to someone but never anyone answers .
negative	i have also emailed on several_occasions and only just had a response after threatening legal actin .
negative	will never ever use this company again .
negative	i am sure they are fine when things don_'_t need replaced , as they are getting your money but watch out if things go_wrong .
negative	poor mans flowers sent in a burst box would have been better getting a bunch from a garage
negative	it took three tries for them to send the correct order , each time with long delays .
negative	slow to respond to email and no phone number .
negative	took two full months from placing the order to getting it sorted_out - unacceptable by any standards .
negative	whilst trying to book flights on this website , the times and prices constantly changed .
negative	we then rang up and the prices were actually £_00 more .
negative	after this , they would not let us book as they had messed something_else up in october ( booked a hotel room , then cancelled it , then charged us twice ) which was blocking my account .
negative	i called to sort this out , ( this was the fifth phone_call by now ).
negative	i told the woman i spoke to about 00 times that i couldn_'_t book but she continued to ask me for my booking_reference , i then asked to be put through to a manager , was put through to customer_services who i couldn_'_t hear properly , then they put me on hold straight_away .
negative	i stayed on hold for 00_minutes then hung_up .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	never using them again .
negative	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_near this company .
negative	the order took over six_weeks to arrive after they had taken my money .
negative	i had to e_- mail them and call them numerous_times to chase the order .
negative	i was given wrong information and no - one ever called back as promised .
negative	after partial delivery of the order , when i rang to find out where the rest of it was i was told it had been cancelled !
negative	this was not at my request , but on best bathroom '_s own initiative - but no - one told me .
negative	finally , the courier company they use is a disgrace - the chance of your goods being damaged in transit is very high .
negative	and we stayed in all day waiting for the order which we had been told to expect on 0 separate_occasions !
negative	customer service ?
negative	this is not a concept embraced by any bestbathrooms employees .
negative	do not use them - put your business elsewhere !
negative	i ordered flowers for a friends 00th_birthday .
negative	they never arrived .
negative	what is worse , is i have contacted_iflorist two times ( they seem to have no customer support number ) and they have ignored both my emails , not even offering an explanation or apology .
negative	i would never recommend using this company .
negative	they just take your money and are an unreliable service .
negative	as much as the experience with ebookers was good .
negative	the marketing emails which then followed were absolutely_dreadful as they came in a few at a time and then continued for days and days and days .
negative	i unsubscribed and i called ebookers and nothing happened , even more emails appeared .
negative	they seem to have stopped now , as i asked for my account to be closed .
negative	will never again use ebookers , as a result of this .
negative	i live in a village and when i got a brand_new phone with their contract they said i live in a strong orange network area what a load of rubbish that was i have to stand by the back door just to get a signal i can '_t get it anywhere_else around the house so i would not recommend orange to any one
negative	thought i '_d say that am disappointed in the fact that i sent an_email regarding ' the spider in the jar ' the day before yesterday and no one has contacted me !
negative	not good customer_relations really !
negative	back in jan we ordered an item through an ebayer , who chose hermes & 0_weeks_later no delivery , no calling_card etc .
negative	the seller called them and they said delivery had been attempted twice !
negative	well why was there no calling_card ?
negative	chasing and chasing , another week_later and we finally have a card through the door - 0rd and last attempt it said !
negative	i can put money on it that it was in fact his first_attempt !
negative	he left a scribble of a number on the card - so had to guess most of the number , he didn_'_t have much to say when he was proven to be a liar and that he hadn_'_t even attempted to come and deliver .
negative	i mean what do they do ?
negative	sit at home nicking peoples parcels and saying they '_ve delivered them ?
negative	i mean really !
negative	as we work during the week he was unhelpful by saying he can only deliver during the day and midweek and he cant leave the parcel in our garden or coal shed because he cant come on our property ??!!
negative	what the heck !
negative	i have never_heard such crap from a courier .
negative	eventually we had to get him to throw it over our garden wall and hope that it didn_'_t get damaged .
negative	as he is too frigging lazy to open the gate right next to where he chucked it over !!
negative	!
negative	0nd experience i had with them was when i ordered something from zaggora - ordered some expensive clothing which i really wanted to arrive quickly .
negative	00 days_later - nothing !
negative	i had purposely had them sent to work so i knew someone could sign for them , i contacted the company and they told me when it was passed to the courier ... only 0_days ago !!!!!
negative	they gave_me the tracking_number , i went online and it said ' delivery failed - address query '.
negative	i know for a fact that the office gets a good three deliveries from this company a week - and to be fair the driver is always good , and friendly so i knew that the problem must have been from somewhere in the warehouse .
negative	and why the hell don_'_t they tell anyone there was a problem with the order !!!
negative	they just left it there !
negative	i was so angry i have to admit i sent quite a rude email , but i was so fed_up of being_messed about by this company previously and had spent a lot of money - i wanted the service which was paid for ... they got back to me and said the address was incomplete - well it wasn_'_t when zaggora confirmed my order so im pretty sure it was hermes ' cock up again ... the company had to send a whole new order out - which i did receive within 0_days ... so was 0_weeks before i received a delivery which was suppose to be a max of 0 working_days !
negative	!
negative	i am now awaiting another parcel ( ordered from a retailer and hopefully the last ever order to be couriered through hermes ) we were told it would be delivered by thursday 0th_july ... what a surprise - no delivery or calling_card as of yet .
negative	i will be doing my best to avoid this company and will think_twice about purchasing a item if they are the chosen courier .
negative	i '_d happily pay more for a service which i know i will receive .
negative	i don_'_t want to pay for a service from a company run by a bunch of cowboys .
negative	watchdog should seriously think about looking into them !
negative	and i rate them 0 not 0_star !
negative	avoid this company at all costs .
negative	totally dishonest , unrealiable and just plain incompetent .
negative	i will never be back there .
negative	quite reassured to read these reviews and finding out i wasn_'_t the only experiencing problem with this company .
negative	booked a day off to receive a parcel one week and a half in_advance .
negative	they called on my mobile to confirm the date , and even asked if this is the number i should be contacted on .
negative	not sure about the point of this , since they didn_'_t show up and didn_'_t called me .
negative	after i complained to the merchant i ordered the items , they replied " it must have been a miscommunication "!
negative	trying to book another delivery day , but not convinced they are going to show up at all ...
negative	well , i had a bad_experience with this company and in_spite of being a loyal_customer of the company for a long time , once i made a mistake and ordered a wrong_colour printer_ink .
negative	yes , we opened the packaging of the ink as there was no any sign of the ink description or printer model description on the packaging which means until you open it you can not see what was in it , or for what model of printer that was .
negative	thus , that was a catch and when i tried to contact and resolve that problem with the customer service i just was told that they would not be able to refund or even to exchange the ink for another one as we opened the packaging ( even_though we did not even placed it into our printer !)
negative	which means i lost my money and had to reorder another one from them again , which cost me more .
negative	and yes , i lost my time trying to communicate with them and at the end after 0 emails i got no any responce at all .
negative	the outcome of my experience is that i will never buy from this company any ink as if you have any_problems do not expect them to be resolved or do not expect to get any customer service !!
negative	!

negative	scottish_power are inefficient and the worst company i '_ve ever dealt_with .
negative	they state on their website the calling time " average pick_up 0 minutes " then you ring and find you can be on there for up to 00_minutes before being answered .
negative	once you have someone answer the phone they pass you from_pillar to post .
negative	" oh i don_'_t deal with direct_debit payment plans i will pass you on " " hello direct_debit team , oh i dont deal with payment plan " " hi payment plan team , oh i don_'_t deal with a wrongly calculated bill being issued let_me pass you on ".
negative	it was ridiculous , i was on the phone nearly 00_minutes on an 0000 number charging me a fortune and they solved absolutely nothing .
negative	when i got to the 0th gentlemen_who was about to pass me on for a 0th time (!!!
negative	), i said " i can '_t_believe this will be the 0th time someone has passed me on ."
negative	to which he put the phone down on me .
negative	absolutely ridiculous .
negative	i can '_t express how much i hate this company and its stupid unnecessary inefficiences .
negative	disgraceful service .
negative	absolutely_disgraceful .
negative	for as long as i live i will never in my life buy energy from this company no matter_how low their prices are !
negative	well , first of all i paid 00_quid for 0 - 0 day delivery and it took 0_days ...
negative	but second , and far worse , i bought a matching set of waistcoast and bow_tie that doesn_'_t actually match - even in the dark .
negative	so all in all , a complete waist of 00_quid :(
negative	where do i start ??
negative	place order 00th_october email received from did awaiting parcel expected delivery 0th no still not received on the 00th phone_call [_name_] said will chase_up ?
negative	then esop spoke to twice ????
negative	00th still no order very annoyed with negative response from esop said refund required very annoyed ?
negative	but on the 00th i explained i wanted to speak to a supervisor was told they would ring me back nothing !!!!
negative	the pharmacy dept have always been helpful and received promptly ?
negative	the non_prescription order short of rubbish ?
negative	sorry to say ??
negative	i have spent a lot of money with best pet over the time ??
negative	obviously customer_satisfaction needs to be instilled !
negative	asked for refund having to go elsewhere !!
negative	!
negative	we have used meet and greet services at numerous airports before and never had any_issues .
negative	firstly we were made to wait around 00_minutes when we first got to the airport and the guy_who drove our car away had no id and could only speak pigeon english !
negative	it was the first time we felt uneasy leaving our car with a meet and greet service .
negative	on return our car has obviously been involved in a minor incident , leading to two alloys being scratched and a type being_ripped apart .
negative	our spare_tyre was on ( replacing the tyre that had been punctured ) and the " chauffeur " - i use this term loosely - had absolutely no idea about what had happened , although he had been driving the car with the spare_tyre on .
negative	a complete_joke !
negative	we then had to drive home with the spare_tyre on at 0 . 00am in the morning , and spend the rest of the day sorting_out a new tyre and the other issues .
negative	attempts to get an answer from head_office have proved futile over the past two_weeks .
negative	but until i do , i will be doing my upmost to warn consumers of this company '_s shoddy - and dangerous - approach to business .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	i ordered dog boots and stag bars in february .
negative	boots arrived 0 - 0_weeks after ordering and only after i had chased them up on numerous_occasions .
negative	they were marked as being in stock when i ordered them or i would have gone_elsewhere .
negative	we are now at 00th_may and despite_emailing and phoning them i have yet to receive the delivery of the stag bars .
negative	their lack of customer service is astounding , they never answer the phone it just diverts to an answer machine , they are never online to chat when you are on the website .
negative	you '_ve more chance getting the items you '_ve ordered if you just give your order and money to a total stranger in the street !
negative	needless to say i won_'_t be a returning_customer - shop at your_peril .
negative	even_though iflorist have said on this website they are refunding an order , they '_ve not contacted me personally to say so or follow_up .
negative	obviously not very important to them .
negative	i ordered flowers for mothers_day .
negative	they arrived on the day but one of the blooms was already dead on arrival .
negative	after_speaking to my mum later in the week i was told that half of what was left had to be thrown out on the wednesday and by friday they were all gone .
negative	when i emailed to complain i was told that they need photographic_evidence and inform them within 0_days .
negative	the flowers were no cheaper_than interflora and if i '_ve ever had any_problems with any if their deliveries then i do not get a dismissive email in response .
negative	i will never use this company again and i recommend that no one else does either to avoid wasting your money .
negative	although the phone was not the replacement phone was not the one i signed_up to they refused to remedy the situation but said i would have to pay a cancellation_fee if i wished to end the contract .
negative	staff were quite happy to leave me as an unsatisfied customer tied_into a contract which was not that i signed_up to .
negative	unfortunately you do not have a choice as a customer ordering online as to who delivers your parcel or picks_up a parcel from you .
negative	my first experience amazon asked them to collect something x 0 attempts of waiting in all day and nothing .
negative	i complained and amazon sent dpd and picked it up first time when scheduled !
negative	this experience - rescheduled online for saturday delivery .
negative	waited in all day no - one turned_up .
negative	telephoned yesterday and spoke to marcus - told me yodel cannot guarantee to deliver on a saturday !
negative	it does not say this anywhere on the help or faq_section or on the website when you click to have it delivered on a saturday , it actually says "
negative	thank_you !
negative	you have successfully rescheduled your parcel ."
negative	marcus then took my telephone no and said he would speak to the depot to see if it could be delivered on saturday 0 june .
negative	he then came back on the phone and said , we cannot guarantee we will phone you we will try and re deliver it on saturday .
negative	i come home today , 00 may and there was an attempted delivery !
negative	it has now been returned to the depot and my arranged delivery for sat 0 june was cancelled !!
negative	!
negative	what the hell is the point ?
negative	they could not tell me why this happened nor why it was not delivered last saturday .
negative	yodel make you wait in 0am to 0pm for nothing .
negative	they don_'_t apologise , cannot guarantee to deliver or call you - a delivery company who cannot guarantee deliveries .
negative	it is laughable .
negative	i am going to inform wilkinsons their contract with yodel should be terminated and will report them to watchdog .
negative	do not ever ever use them .
negative	first experience with boohoo - & my last .
negative	wrong dress was sent in correctly labelled bag ... had to chase refund & make_sure full_refund was made without repacking / postage fee deducted as boohoo '_s error .
negative	i ordered an item for next_day delivery ( for a special event ), then received text_messages to say my item would not arrive until 0th_december ( a few_weeks after ordering ).
negative	rang the customer_services number and a kind lady said no problem i can cancel your order and you won_'_t have any charges .
negative	guess_what - item arrived and i have been charged anyway and now have to arrange a return .
negative	we ordered a footmuff for our pram with a 0 - 00 days delivery period .
negative	0_weeks_later i enquired as to the whereabouts of our order as the website still listed it as waiting for stock .
negative	i was told it would be another couple of weeks and said i would wait .
negative	0_weeks_later i contacted kiddies - kingdom again and was now told it wouldn_'_t be available until june as it was a new item .
negative	this begs the question as why it was listed as available on their website in the first place and why it had a delivery period of 0 - 00 days !
negative	at no point did they contact me to let_me know of the delay .
negative	having waited 0_weeks i still have no footmuff for our pram and will have to buy one elsewhere .
negative	waste of my time .
negative	absolutely worse service ever !
negative	placed order 00th_march_0000 , for nursery 0 piece furniture set .
negative	argos taken money from my bank_account .
negative	0st delivery date 0nd_april_0000 un available so can '_t deliver .
negative	0nd delivery date 00nd_april_0000 un available
negative	so can '_t deliver .
negative	0rd delivery date 0nd may_0000 , but still can '_t guarantee delivery .
negative	hi there ,
negative	i recently_purchased a starter_pack for my kitten , which contains scratch post , litter_tray , food bowl and a carrier .
negative	money taken out of my account straight_away , the delivery was late .
negative	when it was delivered i was very disappointed with the poor quality of the products and a missing collar .
negative	later on doing more research i found the items cheaper !
negative	!
negative	advice ; do not buy from pet_supermarket .
negative	here is my story ...
negative	i join the 00 days trial lovefilm offers , as i do watch quite a bit of movies and was not sure they may have the right choice for me .
negative	it turn out they did not and 0_days_later i have decided to cancel the account .
negative	when cancelation screen came - it has informed me i have requested a dvd title to be sent and until i return it , the cancellation can not go_ahead and the monthly_fee will be charged .
negative	i wanted to use this service only for streaming online !
negative	not to order dvds .
negative	i was confused , as i did not request a movie and i found the option " rentals ( 0 )" where it clearly_displayed no movies in the list .
negative	on the following_day i recieved an_email that my title is on the way - now i could see actually , which movie " i have ordered ".
negative	speaking to customer_services did not help , they were simply repeating that i have ordered the movie , that i have gone in contract and that i have to read " terms & conditions ".
negative	that '_s my short experience with lovefilm , which i wanted to share .
negative	flowers broken , not as_described .
negative	other order the same plus they have been delivered to wrong_address
negative	i sold my phone on the 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	it was received on 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	it successfully passed_testing on 00 . 00 . 00 and the payment line reads " your payment was sent to you on 00 . 00 . 00 at 00 . 00 "
negative	i have checked my bank_account every day for the £_000 owed to me and on the 0th working day thought something funny was going on .
negative	i decided to email envirophone only to be told i am not receiving the payment until 00 . 00 . 00 , 0_weeks after i started this whole_process .
negative	i will never use this company again , i will be telling_everyone i know not to use them and if i hadnt been working all the time would have sold it on the high_street and got the money the same day !
negative	!
negative	i asked for the phone back and was told i could not receive the phone back as the payment has already been sent !
negative	!
negative	so in summary they have my phone and they have my money !
negative	utterly disgusting company !
negative	at the minute i am unable to view any wowcher deals at all from my i pad . not sure why this is but when i try to click onto anything the screen just flashes and can '_t open .
negative	also i ordered a speaker which came when i was out so got sent to a depot in durham i tried to ring the number on card to let them know when i would be in but no one picked_up phone at depot ... i tried for two_days to ring them to no_avail . i presume it has_been sent back to the supplier of which i don_'_t know who they are ......... stil waiting for my parcel and it '_s been over a month now ....... can you look onto this for me as it cost £_00 . 00 and as i cannot access wowcher i can '_t see if it has_been refunded ....... help please
negative	individual staff that dealt_with me were polite and i believe did their best within the limits of their scope to help me .
negative	it is difficult to summarise my complaint because it is lengthy and i have now put this in writing in full to e_bookers .
negative	the main issues were 0 ) very poor customer service - lengthy times waiting for calls to be answered , poor quality telephone_lines , failure of managers to call back - after promises about this had been made 0 ) information that had been given relating to my booking firstly assured and then contradicted , resulting in its being lost altogether .
negative	finally i have had to make a new booking through another agency .
negative	the last_straw was being told that a refund would take up to 0_weeks to process - this despite the fact that on booking , i was charged immediately .
negative	this is a very poor and unreliable service and i won_'_t be using it again .
negative	the flowers were ordered were for mothers_day and we got asked to requested a preferred day of delivery , we requested sunday as this was mothers_day , they arrived on saturday_afternoon .
negative	also the flowers we ordered were named raspberry_ripple and were display with these colour with a lot of greenery , these came with similar colours but not greenery and nothing atall like the ones we thought we had ordered .
negative	very disappointed especially as these were a lot of money and the picture did not at all represent what we were given .
negative	would not recommend this site to anyone .
negative	ordered some flowers for my mum '_s 00th , they never arrived .
negative	contacted the company to be told they couldn_'_t find the address !
negative	nb_: it '_s a major housing estate in a city , not exactly isolated and nobody_else seems to have a problem finding it !
negative	i was just told they would refund me and they were sorry .
negative	i told them i would not be using the company again but the customer_services rep didn_'_t seem too bothered
negative	will definitely not be recommending this shoddy company !!
negative	!
negative	first time i have ordered from argento , it was to be a gift for my sons_girlfriend .
negative	silver earrings were delivered in this silver jiffy_bag , with the gift box flattened , the silver earrings were just in this see through bag , when looking at them through the bag i could see that the posts on both were bent , i wasn_'_t pleased , it takes you a long time to choose a gift for somebody so when this happens .
negative	so i asked for a refund .
negative	this could have been prevented if only somebody would have put the earrings in a inexpensive plastic_box .
negative	i will not be ordering from argento again until they sort their packaging out .
negative	mrs a godley .
negative	i ordered my child costume for special delivery for tuesday 00nd_oct - i would have thought if you paid an additional postage price of £ 0 . 00 for this service at_least it would work .
negative	no parcel tuesday so made contact only to be advised it couldnt be tracked to see where it was as wasnt scanned which wasnt the girls fault she tried to get the information .
negative	to date still not arrived .
negative	i had a tearful child going to school for his party without the costume he had picked how do you explain to a 0 year_old - not easy .
negative	please dont promise people anything unless you can deliver especially children .
negative	i have emailed twice looking my refund and phone line is always engaged - still to date the 00th of october - no refund or acknowledgement that my refund is being done .
negative	if you call the store , they ask you to contact customer_services which is an indian based call_centre .. great .
negative	they '_ve also had my phone for over 0_weeks , after going in store today they said i needed a new phone but the main office were out of stock of them .
negative	i requested that the provide me with one from their store room and they said no i would need to stick with the loan phone i have !!!
negative	and , if i want to get my money back for blackberry and email service , i will need to request it in writing and it can take up to 0_weeks for a response ...!
negative	!
negative	i have 0 contracts with 0 and certainly will not be renewing ..
negative	i totally agree about stoneacre putting lives at risk .
negative	bought a car for my daughter to travel to university , car was four years old and cost £ 0 , 000 in september .
negative	broke_down the first day she used it .
negative	the car went to the citroen garage for a week , we were assured it was fixed .
negative	as you can_imagine , my daughter had little confidence to now drive all the way to cambridge .
negative	in december , car broke_down again , and was stuck on town bridge for three hours .
negative	again the car was in the garage for a week and assured once again it was working fine .
negative	i demanded our money back , but stoneacre said it was their policy to try and fix it first .
negative	it broke_down again yesterday .
negative	this is the third time .
negative	i will be surprised if she has driven more than 000_miles since the day we got the car .
negative	no one seems to now what is wrong with it .
negative	this time i am demanding my money back and compensation .
negative	we had only hear bad_reviews about stoneacre but it was the only place that sold a car my daughter wanted .
negative	the salesman reassured us that he had been head hunted to improve the companies reputation .
negative	this clearly hasn_'_t worked .
negative	i would advise anyone reading this , to think_twice before buying from this company .
negative	teleflorist should not advertise their services with promises they cannot keep !
negative	they acknowledge the receipt of an order only to e_- mail three hours_later that they have been unable to locate a florist in the university town of lampeter .
negative	this is incredible - there is a florist in the centre of town and they should have been able to execute a very special birthday order which has failed spectacularly .
negative	i will not be using teleforist ever again .
negative	j drew
negative	having paid for next_day delivery i was very disappointed that it turned_up three_days late !
negative	i won_'_t be rushing to buy from blackleaf again .
negative	i can '_t_believe_how bad this service is compared to iplayer and 0od .
negative	constant ads , a snooty pop up yelling at me to turn off ad blocker , picture jumping all over the place , spontaneously rewinds , spontaneously throws in more ads in the middle of a scene then jumps back - horrible !
negative	bought a voucher that i never received .
negative	have emailed twice but no refund !
negative	!
negative	i am trying desperately to return an item that has_been incorrectly delivered and after five phonecalls and a total of 00_minutes on hold at various points i am no closer !
negative	it cannot be this hard to get someone to help me ?
negative	avoid if you want to get on with your life !
negative	unfortunately in my opinion ebay is now a place to go if you would like to get ripped_off :(
negative	i was very disappointed , flowers broken , flowers were brown edged and the box they arrived in were saturated with water .
negative	the bow that was to be tied around them was just laying in the box .
negative	i upgraded the order in order for an very impressive lot of flowers to be delivered but instead i was disappointed .
negative	i was hoping to use your services again for the actual funeral in couple weeks but unless your company follows up on this and can impress me , i will not re - use or recommend .
negative	want to pick_up a trojan , adware , nagware or any other kind of malware ?
negative	then head over to download . com , where it seems you can pick_up a bundle all in one these days .
negative	appalling drop in standards of checking linked software and actively bundling unwanted software in with the good these days .
negative	used to be my trusted_source of software , but not any more .
negative	avoid , avoid , avoid .
negative	ordered a dishwasher from them , picked one showing in stock , booked a delivery date with no delivery time , possibly up to 00pm according to the website , though i find it hard to believe they deliver anything so late , meaning i had to wait in all day .
negative	unplugged my old one and left it standing in the middle of the room .
negative	nobody turned_up .
negative	called the next_day to be told it was out of stock , and they didn_'_t know when it would be delivered .
negative	nobody , of course , had thought to call and let_me know about that .
negative	i asked for , and got , a refund on my delivery charge , as they had broken their contract , and was prepared to wait a week again till i could be in .
negative	apparently could not let_me know by email despite ordering it online , but they would call me and let_me know .
negative	gave them a narrow window of a couple of hours each day when i '_m contactable by phone , which they ignored , and called me back at work , which i had to ignore .
negative	i called them back to be told the next delivery day was over a month after my original order date , like it or lump it , and on a day when i couldn_'_t be in anyway .
negative	i cancelled the order .
negative	do not order from them online , their system is deeply flawed .
negative	both_times i have ordered from pet_supermarket i have had to place an identical order from another company because their service was so slow and i was unable to track where my order was .
negative	both_times my order from the other company arrived before my order placed with pet_supermarket .
negative	won_'_t use them again .
negative	having made my order on monday i was very upset when on tuesday i went into the order to add another item to find that 0 items were now highlighted as ' not available '.
negative	these were basic everyday items !!
negative	- not only were these items unavailable but i hadn_'_t had any notification of the situation .
negative	i telephoned the online number and was told i would receive a telephone_call within 00_mins re the situation .
negative	nothing !!
negative	i called again to be told these basic items were not available - ' sorry '.
negative	if an online grocery service can '_t provide basic items it must be considered useless !!
negative	i have now cancelled the order which was worth over_£_000 . 00 .
negative	i brought two angry bird plush toys as a gift for my brother almost 0_months_ago and they have not arrived .
negative	i have contacted them about it and have requested for the order to be resent .
negative	the items were supposedly redispatched 0_weeks_ago but i still have not received anything from character . com .
negative	i emailed them again a few_days ago asking for a refund and they have not replied .
negative	so now i have lost £_00 . 00 and have a disappointed brother , brilliant !
negative	may i add , i have not had this problem with any other company i have purchased from .
negative	i am extremely angry with this company and will not be buying from them again !
negative	i ordered a bouquet of vibrant roses to be sent to my mother - in - law for mother '_s day .
negative	the flowers were due to be delivered on friday 00th_march in plenty of time for sunday .
negative	when i tracked my order i could see that it still said allocated and not delivered .
negative	i tried to contact the company over the weekend using the phone , the ticket raising section and the online help but to no_avail .
negative	the flowers were not delivered .
negative	i then spent the rest of the week trying to contact the company via_email and phone to find out what had happened to the flowers and to arrange a refund .
negative	having finally gotten though to someone , after ten_minutes on hold , all they could do was find out from the florist they had requested the flowers from where they were and then email me back , i felt thoroughly fobbed_off !
negative	obviously i no_longer require the flowers as mother '_s day has long passed .
negative	they say on their site that they have a 000_% guarantee but i '_m currently at 0 %!
negative	all i want at this point is a refund .
negative	i would not use this company for flowers , the customer service is awful and virtually_impossible to get_hold of and your flowers won_'_t even arrive !
negative	i '_m giving them until the end of the week to sort this out and if i get no joy i '_m reporting them to trading_standards and watchdog .
negative	iflorist contacted me regarding this matter and said after investigating i was due a full_refund .
negative	i have yet to receive this refund .
negative	i have tried contacting them a number of times regarding this matter but they once again impossible to get_hold of .
negative	avoid at all costs !
negative	i have ordered two beds from 0 different companies in the last 0_weeks and they were due to be delivered by the bridgend depot 000 .
negative	the first time they said when i eventually got to speak to them was that a part was missing but didn_'_t have the courtesy to phone me to tell me and my partner had taken a day off work to wait for the delivery .
negative	cancelled the order and ordered through someone_else to find that they also use this company .
negative	they have said they tried to deliver today and left a card when my partner was there all day and at the time they say they did this currys were actually delivering a freezer so clearly lying .
negative	i have phoned and left messages and nobody returns my call .
negative	i have emailed a complaint and no one has responded - at the end of my tether now - hoping someone will respond on here at_least as they seem to !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i can '_t even rate them
negative	i wonder what checks wowcher undertake with their merchants to ensure that they are bonfida companies .
negative	in september , using a wowcher , we bought a 0 " tablet from <_external link_removed >.
negative	after many emails and calls to <_external link_removed >,.
negative	the item arrived nine weeks_later .
negative	on receipt it was wrapped up and hidden way until christmas .
negative	on christmas day the item didn_'_t appear to work properly - kept on freezing , couldn_'_t hold a battery charge , wouldn_'_t recognise internet_connection .
negative	however , we persevered , but to no_avail - the tablet no_longer works and continually freezes .
negative	in these circumstances the sale of goods_act is clear , the item is not fit for the purpose - return to seller for a refund .
negative	oh that we could .
negative	it seems that <_external link_removed_> no_longer has a web presence / phone number / customer service / returns address .
negative	sadly , from our experience and those of many others who have posted on the www , it seems that <_external link_removed_> was a scam .
negative	they appear to have been knowingly selling faulty , chinese made tablets and promoting the fraud by using wowcher to validate their products by promoting a discount_voucher .
negative	.
negative	wowcher '_s involvement in <_external link_removed >' fraud is unclear .
negative	the promotion of <_external link_removed_> by wowcher implies that they endorsed the product / company .
negative	after all they wouldn_'_t have ' vouchers ' for scam companies would they ?
negative	it seems that any check that wowcher undertake with those whose services and products they are promoting is not sufficiently vigorous enough .
negative	hopefully wowcher will be able to resolve this and instigate procedures which will prevent other_companies from using the to scam people .
negative	in the mean time we would be grateful to know what action we can take in returning the tablet and receiving a refund .
negative	why did i not check that very use this company .
negative	why am i always on the receiving end of their incompetent and lying drivers ?
negative	yet again , i have been informed over the website that the driver attempted a delivery at 0 . 00 and left a card through the door .
negative	which door ?
negative	not my door .
negative	seeing as i have been home since 0pm then plainly he has knocked_off early to go home and have his dinner .
negative	it is a criminal offence to falsify documentation .
negative	if the driver has done this , he should be sacked .
negative	i have re - scheduled for wednesday but given he / she does know where i live ( he / she didn_'_t know where i lived earlier this year either as two garden chairs from tesco were apparently delivered to me and signed for , only naturally they were not - hope the delivery driver had nothing but misery out of sitting on my chairs all summer long ) then how on earth is my expensive electrical item going to get to me on wednesday ?
negative	and yes , yodel , before you respond to this i have indeed just sent an_email to the address given so no need to respond to me via this website thank_you .
negative	disgraceful company .
negative	neil lloyd , ceo of this dreadful business , are you reading any of these reviews ?
negative	if not , why not .
negative	i was new to 0 as from last friday 0th_february_0000 .
negative	in fact i had always been on payg with another company but decided to get a better phone and go on a contract .
negative	i wish i hadn_'_t gone to 0 and probably was too hasty in my plans but hindsight is a wonderful thing !
negative	i was reasonably happy with the phone and knew several people who had the same phone but what i didn_'_t bargain for was that what i was paying under the contact was almost_double what some friends were paying with a better package ( more talk time .)
negative	i phoned customer_services today ( 00th_feb ) and was appalled by the manner of the staff and the excessive holding time .
negative	i wish i had never gone to 0 but they weren_'_t prepared to reduce payments or increase my plan and i am stuck with them for 0 years - it would cost almost the same to leave as it would to stay - the only discount being 0 %.
negative	unbelievable !
negative	items of bad quality and unsealed so returned items still no refund avoid this company .
negative	they took 0 bloody month to deliver a parcel from north london to central_london ... parcel lost in transit , went via germany , came back in uk , lots of clothes stolen !!!
negative	changed my packaging as well
negative	very rude customer service
negative	i ll never use them again !
negative	hi everyone , i changed from edf to first_utility and i wish i never did .
negative	ever_since i changed i only have been having trouble with the reading over billed for a two bed house £ 0000 for 0months worth of use of electricity and on top of that when we changed back to edf they said that conveniently the the prices went up by december_0000 and i got billed by the same 00p rather_than 00p for the previous 0months (@ 00p and the last months and a half they charge 00p_per unit ) so they split my bill in two regardless of me using less units for the month and a half so they can raise the leaving bill so they wont owe me any money ( being in credit ) and ending up owing them money .
negative	we had a dispute about the readings and that last it 0months and a lot of agro and for something that they suppose to do come get a reading their estimate was over 00000 units and for their own mistake i had to fend of credit collection companies that first_utility forward it my " non paid estimate bill of £ 0000 " .
negative	to put it simply , i would not recommend first_utility to anyone they are nothing but useless and in my eyes a bunch of con_artists .
negative	i was a pipex customer for years and had very little complaints about them .
negative	since talk_talk took over i feel the quality of service has dropped dramatically - and it '_s only been a couple of weeks !
negative	i asked for a simple change on my account ; i was on the phone for over an_hour , was passed around , told to ring 0 different numbers , and my query has still not been answered .
negative	sorry talk_talk but you ' re not listening to me - i am very disappointed with your service .
negative	this is a follow_up from a previous review relating to being_able to return a faulty item of clothing .
negative	i was really hoping that this was finally resolved and i could post something more positive , but the return_label they emailed me , which is meant to be to send for free from a collect_+ store , apparently isn_'_t the right one .
negative	in addition to this , they checked the box that stated i wanted to replace the item , when i couldn_'_t have been clearer that i wanted a refund .
negative	the guy in the shop tried to scan the barcode today , and after_reading the email from hut_group and double_checking the attached return form , said that the label they sent me is incorrect .
negative	there is no option to create my own return_label on the collect_+ website for this retailer either - tried to email care @ hutgroup . com and got a failed deliver response .
negative	nice .
negative	delivery to the following recipient failed permanently :
negative	care @ thehut . com
negative	technical details of permanent failure :
negative	google tried to deliver your message , but it was rejected by the server for the recipient domain thehut . com by mail00 . thehut . net .
negative	[ 00 . 000 . 00 . 000 ].
negative	to be honest i '_m so fed_up of faffing i '_ll probably just give the clothes away - it '_s cheap tat anyway !
negative	way to take my money though hut_group !
negative	i relieved my aaa + remy hair to be disappointed as the quality of it is very poor if it wasn_'_t in my hair i would have sent it back already but i , not risking to send it back to then not get a refund
negative	i am_disgusted by this service , i have pay monthly for my device to be protected .
negative	0_weeks_ago ( 00th_august ) i made a claim as my phone has decided to stop charging due to a fault with the charger_port .
negative	i am_currently charging my phone via my boyfriends phone in order to have battery life from day to day .
negative	it '_s ridiculous - all i keep receiving is automatic email replies regarding my claim .
negative	i would like a response as soon as possible before i cancel this appalling service i am paying for .
negative	same day transfer but will cost £_00 . 00 - customer service difficult to get_hold off and they took too much from my bank_account - still_awaiting reply about this .
negative	would not be looking to use them again - interest_rates very high - only plus point is that you can pay back in 0 installments , but interest is added on making the overall cost very expensive .
negative	terrible i still have not received my purchase from this company
negative	i purchased from the website over a week_ago and i still do not have my item .
negative	i am now going on holiday without it and am now worried it will be dumped on my doorstep for 0_weeks by yodel !
negative	terrible company , i was promised on upgrade a price that was very reasonable so accepted .
negative	upon further questions after the upgrade had been added i was told i wouldnt get it at the pre upgrade price and it would now be a whacking £_00 extra each_month .
negative	they said i wasnt actually eligible for the offers i had originally been promised and wud have to pay the extra £_00 each_month - i would never ever pay this much for a phone contract .
negative	if i hadnt been wise enough to question and check my account on line and questioned them when the price of my contract was at the higher price i would of been simply trapped into another 0 years with this rubbish so called company .
negative	initially i was told this amount would change at midnight - which surprise_surprise did not .
negative	so called them to be told i was not now for some mystery not eligible when prior to upgrading i was ????
negative	i gave them all the correct info they asked for and was told i was eligible as a member of their family is in the same situation as myself ( its amazing how many of them will say they have the same situation etc etc just to get you to trust them - it happened twice to me within the space of 0 mins with two different members of staff .
negative	to get them to realise and agree total responsibility was virtually_impossible .
negative	their opinion once they have you locked in again is " tough "!
negative	they did eventually agree that i was miss sold but to cancel the order of the new phones was again virtually_impossible .
negative	i would never ever go with this company ever again and cannot stress more strongly than not to believe what offers you are accepted prior to upgrading .
negative	i now have been told the order cannot be cancelled as it is in progress which i do not fall for at all and that i have got to accept delivery then send them back myself and then wait for them to receive them in order for my contract to revert_back to what i had originally .
negative	the stress this has caused and my time wasted is unbelievable - do not join them please go with another company if you want exactly_what is said on the tin and not be conned_into signing_up for something that you have not agreed to !!!
negative	total illegal sales_techniques and from the look of it on here is not in any way an_isolated case !
negative	!
negative	still_haven_'_t received my order , no card was left to say whether it was tried to be delivered never received an_email to say when it should be with me by .
negative	i '_m completely disappointed by the service .
negative	once again i tried wiggle for one last time .
negative	again ... a faulty product and waited 0_weeks so far fir a postage refund .
negative	useless company
negative	i can '_t understand anything they say
negative	absolutely_appalling service from talktalk business - they mis sold us a broadband package which is supposed to include web builder - email addresses and domain_name , that we still_haven_'_t received 0_months later .
negative	this offer is still being advertised on uswitch where we found it .
negative	we have now made 0 separate phone_calls to them on the same matter & in each case have been told that " someone will call you back ".
negative	we ' re still_waiting for a single call to be returned & still have no web builder package .
negative	highly unlikely we '_d ever recommend them & will probably have to cancel our contract .
negative	they have potentially spoilt my 0 year_olds christmas .
negative	i would not have ordered through this company if they had not made the claim that they dispatch the same day !.
negative	they have totally let our family down .
negative	we are very disappointed .
negative	we ordered on the 00th_december_0000 with the claim next_day dispatch and the goods have not arrived .
negative	we have made 0 phone_calls and all we have been told is that at check out it said 0_days dispatch ?
negative	this was definitely not the case , the item was in stock so should have been dispatched and delivered but has not arrived .
negative	we are very sad and disappointed !
negative	i had used envirophone before with no_issues a few_years bac , so decided to use them again to recycle my iphone_0s .
negative	the phone was in great condition aside from a fault with the power_button .
negative	i was quoted £_000 but knew i would be offered less due to the power_button .
negative	i was quoted £_00 . 00 due to " water_damage " i dont care what you say envirophone my phone aint been near no water !!
negative	so asked for its return .
negative	phone took around 0_weeks to be returned due to a " system glitch " pfft !
negative	even better the charging_port now doesnt work !!!
negative	cheers for that envirophone ... brill service not .
negative	in simple terms dont_waste your time
negative	their_database needs to be updated so people don_'_t waste their time .
negative	the guy before us got his quote based on make , model and year ... database should have recognized it was an 0 cylinder vehicle , but wbac representative kept using that against him to joggle down the price , a lot .
negative	same with us , a part ( push bar on an suv ) that isn_'_t part of the initial vehicle had minor_damage , but was used against us .
negative	it is my opinion that wbac are scammers and i am so glad i didn_'_t do_business , but they wasted my time .
negative	i bet most of the positive_reviews on here are people they pay ... but this is my opinion .
negative	oh , by - the - way ... katie is their online defense .
negative	she '_s very professional and will request detail such as wbac number so she can " look into it " and say that she '_s sorry so more people can fall victim .
negative	you know ... showing that the company " cares ", but all they care about is scamming people .
negative	katie , answer this ... the negative_reviews , how can there be so many ?
negative	people , do online research , search for the negative_review because they pay people online to post positive_comments to drown out the negative one '_s !!
negative	!
negative	terrible service .
negative	i ordered some flowers for my sick_friend from this company .
negative	i didn_'_t realise that she was staying with her mum so i ordered them to be delivered to her home address .
negative	0 hours after i ordered the flowers she told me that she had gone down to stay with her mum for help to look after her 0 year_old_son .
negative	i then immediately contacted the company to ask for the address to be changed and the answer was no !!
negative	i just think this is unacceptable as the flowers are sitting on her door_step !
negative	i don_'_t drive and her mum_lives an_hour away from her address .
negative	my thoughtful idea was ruined !
negative	the reasons behind why they couldn_'_t change the address didn_'_t make_sense as i asked them to change the address on the same day i ordered the flowers !
negative	very disappointed and upset .
negative	awful service with last_minute . com .
negative	last_minute . com promise a refund within a few_days if you find the hotel cheaper else where !
negative	i found the hotel cheaper on another site but still_havnt heard_anything regarding my refund !
negative	i got told on the phone to send a link of the website where i found the cheaper hotel , which i did .
negative	but then i had an_email_saying i need to send them a screen_shot !
negative	i don_'_t have an i phone so it looks like i won_'_t get my refund after all !
negative	i '_m very annoyed , false_advertising !
negative	not happy got a quote for my laptop from them .
negative	i didn_'_t receive the packaging they told me they would send out to me so couldn_'_t send the laptop .
negative	that was months_ago and havnt heard_anything from them since .
negative	exorbitant postage_charges , items missing , replacements sent late with inadequate postage , lead to charges from royal_mail .
negative	no reply to emails asking for a refund .
negative	all in all terrible .
negative	i have been completely let_down by wren living .
negative	having made a purchase on sat 00th_january i was told delivery would be monday 00th_january .
negative	i got a text_message to confirm delivery would be between 00 : 00 - 0 :_00pm .
negative	i took the day off and waited all day and the delivery never showed .
negative	it wasn_'_t until after 0pm that the delivery driver told me they wouldn_'_t be coming today because they had run_out of time .
negative	no attempt was made to explain what i should be doing to rearrange delivery and no apology was offered .
negative	i then spent over 00_minutes calling premium numbers to ask what was going on .
negative	i was passed from_pillar to post and each time had to explain my situation .
negative	at one point they even told me they couldn_'_t find my order details .
negative	i was told that by 0pm today the delivery company would call and tell me when re - delivery would be .
negative	have they ?
negative	of course they haven_'_t !
negative	i cannot_afford to wait in for another whole day for the same thing to happen .
negative	my advice do not order from this company .
negative	a complete_waste of time and money .
negative	you have been warned .
negative	i don_'_t need to explain my case .
negative	it resembles the reviews .
negative	for the record :
negative	i waited 0 full year for 0 designchairs , it has_been delayed 0 times , 0 times without giving notice , i called 00 times with 0 different people , haven_'_t been called back for 0 times , emailed over 00 times , waited for my refund for 0_months untill i mailed to stefanie mueller from infurn .
negative	when you are having problems , contact stefanie mueller ( stefanie . mueller @ infurn . com ).
negative	she can really help and keeps her word .
negative	good luck .
negative	it would take me way too long to list the incredible ineptitude and dreadful customer_care .
negative	let '_s just say that i have had issues with my broadband performance for some months now and when i contact them i am told incorrect information .
negative	they make things up as they go along .
negative	i have had to give up as i cannot handle the stress of it .
negative	i have been using aol for many many_years but will never use them again and will advise others not to .
negative	do not take an aol account !
negative	i ordered the caliope deluxe flowers to arrive on saturday to take to a 00th_birthday on sunday .
negative	they arrived on saturday and were the completely wrong order .
negative	the flowers looked straggly and were clearly not what we had ordered instead of the caliope bunch they appeared to be a standard bunch of red and yellow flowers .
negative	as this was such a special_occasion we had to buy a bunch from asda which cost half the price and looked a lot nicer .
negative	i will be emailing photos of the flowers we received and requesting a full_refund .
negative	firstly , flowers arrived one day late , secondly the recipient described them as " a bit droopy ".
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i was hoping the recipient would say " wonderful - thank_you so much ".
negative	in future i will use trusted companies such as interflora and flowercard that deliver fresh and beautiful flowers .
negative	they cost a little more but they ' re worth it !
negative	i rent a car for 0_days in miami ( usa ) i have an american driver license and they did not want to accept it !!!
negative	because they want an europeen driver license .
negative	when i ask to be reimburse your site say no so i loose my money and i have to pay a second time for a car .....
negative	i am very mad .
negative	terrible customer service , never did get the part and never got a refund .
negative	these people steal your money .
negative	do not buy from them .
negative	on a sunday morning we like if possible to have something from the mcdonalds breakfast menu , this would always be the same things for my son & myself it is the egg & bacon bagel meal & my husband has a sausage & egg mcmuffin , an easy order wouldn_'_t you say , it seems not when it comes to our local mcdonalds the last 0 times yes 0 times my husband has_been to the restaurant he has come_back with egg & bacon mcmuffins despite telling the person serving exactly_what we wanted & asking them to make_sure & check ( & getting the look that would kill ) , as the parking is difficult ( main_road , parking restrictions everywhere ) my husband has to be as quick as possible so its only when he has got home and given us our orders that we have discovered yet again they have got it wrong even_though ( as i have mentioned earlier ) my husband insisted they checked the order , it may seem petty but if i went into a shop & asked for a bottle of milk i would not expect to get a bottle of lemonade , i actually hate mcmuffins so i was not best pleased on 0 occasions to have them instead of bagels !
negative	we have not gone back to that mcdonalds since ( they are always messing up orders & are rude ) & when i complained to mcdonalds customer service all i got told was that the restaurant in question was a franchise & basically not their problem but they would pass on my comments & details & that i would hear back from the manager , well that was two_weeks_ago ....... still_waiting ....., well_done mcdonalds your customer service is non exsistant and i will not be " dinning " in any of your branches again .
negative	i ordered a set of towels costing_£_00 from a well_known high_street store on september 0th , as i have ordered from this store before many_times i was not too worried that anything would go_wrong , yesterday it dawned on me that my order had not yet arrived so i went straight on to the stores site to check my order status and there in black & white it said 0 / 0 /_0000 time 00 . 00 customer signature !, well that is not at all possible as i was not even at home at that time as i would have been in work , i have called the store only to be told that i will have to wait 00_hours giving hermes time to respond or to see if they can find my parcel !
negative	unbelievable find my parcel according to hermes " the customer " has signed for it , either way they are liars as no body was in when they claimed it was signed for & if they left it with a neighbour where is my card to say where my goods are , absolutely_dreadful service !
negative	and i am now for the moment £_00 out of pocket !
negative	in total , paid £_000 for two tickets inc . £_00 booking_fee and £_00 delivery charge ....... only tofind we were sat in £_00 seats , confirmed by the people sat either_side of us .
negative	it was quite high up and am not good at that too .
negative	this means i paid over double - not happy , won_'_t use again ever :-(
negative	i ordered and paid for a rolex that they said they could get in and basically they couldn_'_t !.
negative	the run around and lies they kept giving me were unacceptable .
negative	they tell you they can get a particular watch and take your deposit and will string you along with lies until they can get_hold of it .
negative	i ended_up paying the full price from a store and wish_id done it sooner and i wish_id never_heard of watchfinder .....
negative	disappointed that despite_being a previous customer i was sent an obviously used item when recently ordering a passport cover .
negative	on returning the passport cover i had to pay the return postage and was then charged for a second time when you issued a replacement .
negative	i would certainly think_twice before placing a further order .
negative	so i have had talktalk as a provider for my phone and internet since i lived in gosport in september_0000 , i then moved to ely , cambridgeshire in november_0000 , and despite phoning and emailing them they were unable to transfer my phone and broadband until a month after i moved but that it turns_out was the least of my problems , i added tv to my package when it became_available and then in february_0000 i then moved to benwick , cambridgeshire and began trying to get my talktalk package transferred to the new house , now at first my new address wasn_'_t available on their system , to the point they asked if it was even registered with royal_mail and said they would have to add it to their system and this would take 0 - 0_days , a week_later i then phoned again to find out what was happening and turns_out the request to have my address added had not even been filed so i was told it would take another 00 days - 0weeks , around 0_weeks_later i phoned again - at this point i had already moved out of my old house , it was then they told me that they could only provide me with a phone line at my new address , so naturally i requested to cancel this also involved them asking me if i wanted to put my account on hold for 0_months while i thought about it - not much to think about really as i wanted phone , internet and tv , thinking the request for cancellation had gone_through i continued to set_up my new house with bt as they were able to proivide all services .
negative	a month went by and suddenly money for a talktalk bill was taken from my bank_account , now i hadn_'_t used any of their services for over a month and having asked for it to be cancelled i got back on the phone to them , where they passed me from person to person hung_up on me and tried to refuse giving me my money back , until eventually telling_me the only was i could get a refund would be in a months time or unless i filed an indemnity claim with my bank - now i did not see why i should have to wait a month for them to pay back money they had essentially stolen from me so i went_ahead and file an indemnity claim at the bank , whilst on the phone talktalk assured me i would be charged no more money and all charges such as early cancellation charges would be voided as they could not provide me with the services i wanted and they had messed me around .
negative	finally i was seeing the light at the end of this rather stressful period , until today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) over 0_months after my first contact with talktalk i receive and email_telling_me my april bill is ready to be viewed , and this is where i get the biggest shock the bill is a total of £_000 . 00 - listing contract breakage fee charges of £_000 . 00 + youview + box deferred fee of £_000 , so their promises of voiding all charges was clearly yet again another lie and not once did they ask for a return of the youview_box , nevertheless they will not on any circumstances be receiving another penny from me as i have cancelled the direct_debit , and i refuse to pay for their mistakes and lies .
negative	ordered two_pairs of boots , nearly 0_days_later got an mail to say that they weren_'_t in stock ......
negative	ordered again the same .. nearly a week_later refunded on both_occasions . what is the point !
negative	exceptionally dissappointed ....
negative	i purchased these for a birthday_present .
negative	the recipient received them damaged and whilted .
negative	i could have gone down to any shop or supermarket and got better ones for £ 0 !!!
negative	very very disappointed and will no_longer recommend serenta to anyone :-(
negative	was not impressed with flowers looked nothing like picture , very disappointment .
negative	they have not got a clue phoned two times today to find out the person dealing_with my claim went home 0 . 00_pm ?????
negative	?
negative	i have had a problem with my booking , have called customer service twice in 00_hours , having been promised that the matter will be investigated and someone from ebookers will call me in 00_hours to resolve the problem .
negative	didn_'_t get any call back so called them again , same promise and till now no call back . its been 00_hours now after the second phone_call .
negative	still_waiting .
negative	unfortunately on this occasion we were disappointed by the flower_arrangement sent to our friends funeral : not only did the arrangement appear dehydrated , the lilies were actually wilting and the special message was written in what only can be described as scrawl .. very unprofessional .
negative	our arrangement stood_out for all the wrong reasons amongst the abundance of wonderful floral_tributes ... we were left_feeling somewhat embarrassed and let_down .
negative	we will certainly reconsider before using iflorist again .
negative	i was originally impressed with the ease of ordering and the time schedule - but what pity one turned_up on the appointed day to install my new telephone line and broadband .
negative	i have not received any phone_call or explanation .
negative	why am i still_waiting ?
negative	two months_ago closing a deal with forbrugerpost . dk ., but the money from the account they still pulls , please return the money as any product i have not received and do not want to receive .
negative	did not receive the ordered product , as well as the money has not yet been returned , waiting for a month , very bad work of the company '_s employees ,
negative	when what you buy doesnt work you expect a company to arrange a replacement - not these people - they cannot even be bothered to reply to emails .
negative	there are plenty of better firms selling the same products
negative	i ordered a tens_machine 00 november , which i needed urgently .
negative	when it did not arrive i chased it on 00 november and was told it had been out of stock but had just come in that day .
negative	i recieved the tens 0_days_later .
negative	i must_say i am unimpressed with the communication .
negative	my sister and i decided on a once in a lifetime_trip to the chelsea flower show .
negative	we went on - line and looked at several web_sites before buying from viagogo .
negative	the full day tickets were too expensive so we settled for half a day with entry from 00 . 00 .
negative	the tickets were £_00 each but we were then horrified to be charged_£_00 . 00 booking_fee , £ 0 . 00 delivery fee and £ 0 . 00 vat .
negative	the total charge was £_000 . 00 for a half a day at the show .
negative	we were even more horrified when the tickets arrived and the price printed on them was £_00 and entry was at 00 . 00 .
negative	it is immoral for these ticket companies to make so much profit on tickets and what was the £_00 . 00 booking_fee for when we booked on - line and did not even speak to anyone !

negative	this has got to be the worst company i have ever had to deal with !
negative	i ordered 0 tickets at the end of june this year ( that is 0_months_ago ) for a ben howard concert that took place on the 00th_november .
negative	i was getting regular email_updates telling_me not to worry - my tickets were being tracked , they would be here etc .
negative	well that was a load of s ** t . i rang the customer service number several_times 0_days , 0_days and on the day of the event explaining i was yet to have my tickets !
negative	i was originally told they would try and find me some other tickets - this was never taken up and on the day of the concert when i was still_waiting to receive my tickets i was simply told i would have to get a refund .
negative	hold on , i booked these tickets 0_months_ago , have waited very patiently , they were for a birthday_present - and i was being told i could go to the gig ??
negative	anyway 0hrs .. yes 0hrs before my gig in london - i am based in kent , my tickets finally arrived !
negative	not only was this unacceptable and diabolical enough , leaving me in such a rush , but when i read the face value of the tickets £_00 . 00 each i had paid over 0 x each per_ticket plus nearly_£_00 for p_&_p that arrived so late i nearly_missed the show !
negative	this site is disgraceful , i got no help and should have been offered some kind of refund or at_least my £_00 postage returned back to me .. at the very least !
negative	never use this site .
negative	very badly run , and a massive rip_off !
negative	i booked a flight online with e . bookers for the first time and it was £_00 cheaper_than booking direct with british_airways on line so i thought that was quite a good deal .
negative	i booked the flight from jersey to gatwick for 0 adults traveling in may and after printing out the confirmation i realized that my baggage was not included only hand_luggage .
negative	i started to panic now - so i phoned e . bookers to get a full_refund - but they told me i would not get fully refunded even_though it was only yesterday that i had booked - i was really annoyed because at no point during the booking did it prompt me about the luggage situation - i honestly feel that i have been conned - i have not cancelled because i am not losing any money - so the only option was to go on ba website and pay for luggage !
negative	the luggage for me and my husband cost us £_00 on top of e . bookers price of £_000 - so in the end i am actually paying way more than i should of .
negative	unable to review as have not received the order .
negative	took_ages for my goods to arrive , it was so slow that i missed my mums_birthday !!
negative	absolute_joke !
negative	if you are going to offer a buying service from the uk ... make it cheaper and faster !
negative	i sent flowers to my mum for her_birthday and the delivery , despite me saying that if no answer they were to be left with the manager ( she_lives in sheltered housing ) was left at the front_door of the complex , no attempt was even made to ring the bell of my mum '_s flat .
negative	however one of her friends noticed them and took them to her door so at_least she got them .
negative	i went down the very next_morning and they were half_dead !!!
negative	the carnations were turning_brown , the gypsophilia was all snapped and the roses were drooping , to say i am not impressed is an_understatement and i doubt i will be using this service again , nor will i recommend it to my friends .
negative	a totally shocking and disgraceful experience .
negative	utter_rubbish .
negative	one wash and the clothes fall_apart .
negative	will never ever buy from them again .
negative	i ordered a big_boy beanbag in wk 00 and was told wk 00 .
negative	now its wk 0 . so even if it does get sent out it will still be 00 weeks .
negative	not good customer service .
negative	further to my earlier comment , ive now had a reply from easy wellies who seem to think its acceptable to charge for 0 day delivery even_though they cant deliver on it then refuse to refund money saying its the fault of the weather , i have taken legal_advice and been told they are in breach of contract but as the amount is £ 0 . 00 . its not worth pursuing . iguess thats how they get away with this sort of unacceptable practice .
negative	easy wellies hard lesson .
negative	i cannot wait_until my contract is up with vodafone as i will never ever use them again .
negative	i have always paid by direct_debit and i recently got_married so went to a joint account , i used the banks account transfer service and my bank contacted vodafone to change my bank details for the direct_debit on the 00 july_0000 . vodafone never acted_upon it even_tho they have admitted they had the details so they have now tried charging me £ 0 late fees and cut my phone off .
negative	totally disgusting and crappy customer service .
negative	i '_ll keep this brief ..
negative	i received a free no_obligation quote from a company , they then harassed me with calls and so i put a negative_review .
negative	the company flagged it , because i had not made a purchase , but in the eyes of the law my purchase was a free quote .
negative	trustpilot didn_'_t respond properly to three emails i sent them , and the final one said i didn_'_t buy anything .
negative	trustpilot isn_'_t accurate representation of companies - very poor
negative	i ordered the bouquet ' tequila sunrise ' for my friend who_likes the colour orange .
negative	however , the bouquet that arrived was totally different from what '_s advertised - ' tequila sunrise ' is described as a ' bouquet in vibrant greens and orange ', with ' lime_green kermit chrysanthemums with bright_orange miniature gerberas and burnt_orange lilies '.
negative	the bouquet my friend received has no orange at all - it '_s very dark in colour , with three dark_red_roses , about six red chrysanthemums , and some white_lilies .
negative	i wrote to iflorist but the reply i got was simply that they could substitute any flower ' of a variety of equal or greater quality , appearance and value '.
negative	so basically they ' re saying that they can send you any bouquet , no matter what bouquet you ordered , which is exactly the case here .
negative	i '_m so disappointed and embarrassed to have sent that to my friend - it '_s like i don_'_t even know what colour she likes !
negative	order from them if you want a totally random bunch of flowers !
negative	make_sure you read the delivery rules .
negative	the delivery man would not deliver even inside the entrance of the home , he said he was not insured to enter the property !!
negative	!
negative	so if you want your items delivered in the street , by all means !

negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered to my friend in australia for her wedding on february 00th .
negative	today is february 00th and they have still not arrived .
negative	the occasion has now passed so even if the flowers reach her now it would be pointless .
negative	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
negative	two_days_later i have still had no contact from anyone .
negative	today i rang the office number for iflorist and the call was answered by a completely disinterested member of staff .
negative	she tried to fob me off saying the flowers may have been left with a neighbour .
negative	when i explained to her that this was not the case as my friend had checked she didn_'_t know what to say .
negative	she then_proceeded to tell me she would contact the florist via_email and get back to me by the end of today .
negative	when i explained there was a 00 hour time difference and i doubted very much the florist would reply in the middle of the night she didn_'_t seem at all concerned .
negative	i now have no interest if the flowers are delivered or not .
negative	the occasion has passed and the surprise has_been spoiled for a dear_friend .
negative	all i want in a refund for the £_00 i handed_over .
negative	terrible , terrible service all_round .
negative	please_avoid this company at all costs .
negative	the car_park seems to be so far away from the airport and the buses not as frequent as it could be , but these are things that can be overlooked for the excellent price .
negative	unfortunately when we arrived to collect our keys it took a while as they were put in the wrong hook , no big deal but when we went to start the car , the key was broken .. now the wrong hook made sense !
negative	it was lucky my husband carries the spare_key .
negative	we complaint right there and then but it seems to be taking more than necessary to get approval to order our key ... let '_s hope it all ends well .
negative	shame that one unscrupulous employee can mar your reputation just for not being honest !
negative	nothing gets done unless you chase .
negative	don_'_t phone you with updates .
negative	conflicting and confusing information given .
negative	conveyancing team were the worst ever used .
negative	i will never use again and advise friends and family not to either .
negative	i should have just ordered abunch of rose very por for 00 pounds use m and s next time
negative	i purchased this vanity_unit from big bathroom store when it arrived it so many faults it is easier to say what was right which was only the doors .
negative	it had faults from screws not being screwed in to shelf bracket shattered and cracks in the side it was rubbish .
negative	the only compliment i can give is that i got my money refunded promptly .
negative	i purchase the same unit from a local_store but cost me £_00 more plus my time .
negative	it seemed like my order had gone_through , i had entered all of my card information .
negative	then i received an_email that my flight was not confirmed unless i sent a lot of extra banking information separately .
negative	not only was this un - nerving and unusual , i didn_'_t know if i had been charged .
negative	only a vague email which i thought meant i didn_'_t have a seat .
negative	and now , i am receiving this email to give my experience with my booking ?
negative	what booking exactly ?!
negative	if the necessary bank information was necessary because i am canadian , and not a european citizen you should have a disclaimer before someone wastes their time with you .
negative	otherwise , i am convinced you are a scam .
negative	thank_you for nothing but wasting my time .
negative	i will never book with you again .
negative	the flowers received ( a thinking of you , for loss of dad ) were not as picture .
negative	no roses , no lilly '_s
negative	flowers were lovely , although a stem is broke .
negative	deliveryman basically throw the bouquet into the frontdoor .
negative	and was extremely rude to the recipiant .
negative	i received the mad_hatters costume for my sons mad_hatters fete this afternoon but was angry to find that when i took it from the packet which had been selotaped up if round that the jacket had a hole in the back of it to me it looks as if someone has tried to iron it so clearly this was not as_described new mandy davidson i will be writing a negative_review
negative	absolutely terrible - i will never use you again .
negative	i paid £_00 for a parcel to be delivered to eire - the [_external_reference_] ireland driver got to a town 0 miles from the destination and asked if anyone knew the village my parcel was addressed to .
negative	a woman said she did so the [_external_reference_] driver said could she take it because he didn_'_t have time .
negative	therefore i received confirmation that the parcel was signed for & delivered but after many phone_calls to my in laws & [_name_] at uni_baggage - no sign of the parcel .
negative	that was at lunchtime .
negative	finally at night time a woman turned_up with the parcel & said this [_external_reference_] driver said he couldn_'_t deliver it .
negative	i rang & complained to uni_baggage & spoke to [_name_] several_times .
negative	i asked for a refund .
negative	he said he would investigate and report back to me .
negative	but what a surprise - i haven_'_t heard a word since .
negative	and now you ' re asking me for feedback -
negative	i am taking this opportunity to request a refund once again .
negative	if i don_'_t get a satisfactory response i will take this further .
negative	emma travers
negative	sent from my iphone
negative	don_'_t go near these_guys if you value your data ; they are scam merchants and from my experience and those of others i have corresponded with , exist to rip people off .
negative	seriously - ask around for recommendations , phone any other data_recovery and ask their opinion on fields / rapid data_recovery , search the net , be prepared to spend more money - avoid_avoid_avoid !
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of sheer pretty_polly control top tights - i had ordered these before and loved them , and more_importantly , they lasted more than 0 or 0 wears before snagging .
negative	when i received my order almost 0_weeks_later from tightsplease , they were the wrong items .
negative	the rights were still by pretty_polly , but not control top , and not the same denier .
negative	given that i live in australia and returning and reordering the tights would cost me extra in the long run , i decided just to try these tights .
negative	first pair ripped as i put one foot in .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend using this website as you ' re not guaranteed to get what you ordered .
negative	too much of a hassle .
negative	i put my order at the same time as my housemate , she got hers 0_days afterwards .
negative	i '_m not bothered by a delay in delivery per_se , but i '_ve sent them 0 emails requesting despatchement confirmation and they simply do not reply .
negative	can '_t find any telephone_numbers or other email addresses on their website , and it '_s just incredibly annoying .
negative	i ordered garden_furniture to the value of £_000 and when it arrived it was brown and not black as i ordered .
negative	i was told they would collect and refund in a series of emails but to date have not been told when they are collecting or any further information what a joke .
negative	as an_oap i really cannot_afford to loose this money but really don_'_t know what else i can do except involve trading_standards and my solicitor .
negative	why don_'_t they have the decency to ring and discuss my problem .
negative	i too will be posting details of their awful service on all sites that i can - do not use them
negative	you have been very efficient in your initial response to my enquiry , by telephone and by email ( i have received 0 emails ).
negative	after_speaking to your helpline yesterday_afternoon i spoke to a women at bower & bailey .
negative	this was just after 0pm and the women said that camilla , who would be dealing_with my claim , was out of the office .
negative	i was told that if camilla returned by 0 . 00pm she would call me then .
negative	if , however , she did not return in time i would be contacted by camilla after 0am this morning .
negative	it is now approaching 0pm and i have heard_nothing .
negative	very poor customer service asked to speak to manager was told i would get call back but didn_'_t until next_day
negative	i have a picture of bouquet ordered versus the one that was sent .
negative	flowers sent were nothing even remortly similar to flowers ordered that i paid almost £_00 for , in fact they look like they had just been picked from the garden and thrown in a vase .
negative	even then some flowers were dying and no food in the package .
negative	so very upset as these were for mother '_s day as i live across the world .
negative	i understand some flowers may not have been available but i expect it to look somewhat similar to the bouquet i ordered otherwise what is the point of picking one .
negative	00_% of the photos had heads chopped_off a waste of money .
negative	terrible experience and service & still no bike or refund !
negative	we ordered a bike from them for my sons brithday .
negative	it didnt arrive 0_days before my sons_birthday when it was due & we chased & chased with no joy .
negative	they told us it had been dispatched to their courier ( yodel ) & was stuck somewhere with them but they couldnt get in touch with them so there was nothing they could do & they refused to re - imburse any money until they had located the bike !
negative	every day we chased & chased & chased to no_avail - they repeatedly promised to call back & update us but never did & refused to take any responsibility .
negative	eventually several days after my sons_birthday and 00 or so calls from us later after my repeated suggestion they escalated above the local yodel depot they said never answered the phone , they finally advised it had been stolen from the depot .
negative	they have now promised the money back but not seen anything yet so who_knows !
negative	the only person i was ever able to speak to was a girl who clearly had no authority to do anything but was well practised in the broken record technique & dealing_with difficult situations - she continually put me on hold to refer to someone_else in the office but refused point_blank to allow me to speak to anyone_else even_though someone was clearly there .
negative	terrible service & i feel ripped_off !
negative	orginal order took to long 0months to be exact
negative	we made an impulse purchase at dixons manchester_airport on 00 march_0000 of a panasonic waterproof dvd camera , specifically to capture our day at discovery_cove but also useful for the rest of our holiday too - or so we thought .
negative	sunday 00 march discovery_cove , husband takes camera into pool to film and the screen fills with water , absolutely no use whatsoever .
negative	not one second of film .
negative	informed dixons via_email when we had internet access to be told that thier refund policy was 00 days .
negative	as we are in the us until 00 april we would be outside their refund period but we could contact panasonic to have the camera repaired .
negative	as it hasn_'_t ever actually worked , how can it be repaired .
negative	it failed to meet the purpose it was purchased for and therefore is no_longer required .
negative	fortunately , our son is returning to the uk just a day inside the refund period and , as the purchase was made in cash , it will be returned for a full_refund as it is faulty and not fit for purpose under the trades description act .
negative	this review is posted as a heads up to anyone who is tempted to make a purchase at manchester_airport or any other dixons airport store , and who is likely to be outside the uk beyond the dixon '_s 00 day refund period .
negative	they do not take any circumstance into account and i have the emails to back this up .
negative	a recurring theme it seems .
negative	website stated ' in stock ' despatch 0 - 0_days , so placed my order , money taken immediately from my credit_card .
negative	waited 0_days and called to see check order status .
negative	i say called , i never actually spoke to a human !
negative	customer helpline is a complete_waste of time .
negative	' you are in a queue , your call will be answered in 00_minutes , if you want to hang up and call back the system will recognise your number and put you back in your spot in the queue '.
negative	three hours and 0 calls later , all saying the same as above but varying wait times , i decided to email .
negative	email was responded to by a ' client experience officer ' who explained that ' due to high_demand they were experiencing delays in despatch '.
negative	numerous_emails chasing my order have failed to extract a despatch date from them .
negative	my next email will be to cancel the order and to contact mb for my money .
negative	having already paid a months interest on it on my cc !
negative	!
negative	if this company takes £_000 from 0000 ( figure as example only , i '_m_sure the turnover is far , far_greater !!
negative	), sits on it for a month with no goods to despatch , even if everyone of the 0000 cancels their order , they will have had interest on £ 0000 for a month .
negative	if they were honest about their lead times .
negative	if they had said 00 days and meant it i could have decided if that was acceptable to me or not .
negative	but to keep pretending or not saying when it will be despatched , it '_s a despicable way to run a business and the authorities should close it down !
negative	i will never , ever , ever , ever , ever touch these people again with a bargepole .
negative	i would rather pay the extra at argos / pc_world or whoever and have the immediate use of it .
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	order at your_peril - you might be lucky - you might not , who_knows ?
negative	if it quacks like a duck , it is a duck !!
negative	!
negative	update_:
negative	i have just been on se website and they have 0 ipads in stock so i was thinking of ordering one .
negative	total liars !!!
negative	!
negative	i just hope i save someone today from placing an order for an imaginary ipad that does exist .
negative	i cannot_believe the positive_feedback on here for this site .
negative	don_'_t you believe it either !
negative	!
negative	i bid for an ipod and won it .
negative	i had to register and pay for shipping but i was over the moon ......... until they wanted id .
negative	they want a photocopy of your passport , a letter with your name and address on and a photo copy of debit_card with the numbers crossed out except for the last 0 or 0 digits .
negative	thats everything they need to steal you identity !!!
negative	so obviously i didnt do that and forgot about it until i checked my bank_statement and ziinga have taken £_00 . 00 out which made me go over my overdraft so i was charged from the bank £_00 a day !!!
negative	when i spoke to the ' live_chat advisor ' she told me that i had signed_up for a platinum account !!
negative	i didnt and there was nothing sayin i had .
negative	theyve cancelled my mermbership but when ive looked on their website i am now gonna be charged_£_00 for cancelling !!!
negative	do not sign up !!!
negative	!
negative	purchased a corner_suite back in december_0000 and took delivery in march_0000 .
negative	foam cushioning sagging and fabric loose on corner_unit after only 0_months of little use ..... csl do not want to know .
negative	they say it is usage ..... i laughed the house down when they told me that but after the laughter came the anger and disgust .
negative	i had a dfs suite before this one and it has lasted 00 years and i still have the 0 chairs as they are brilliant still .
negative	i doubt this csl suite will last 00 months ....... absolutely_shocking , guarantees worthless .
negative	my advise is to contact the furniture ombudsman if you too have problems with your goods .
negative	i purchased an airbed from outdoor leisure direct over a week_ago and contacted them on monday to say that it will not keep inflated , so it is obviously faulty .
negative	after many emails and telephone_conversations at my expense , it is now friday and it is now being collected but that is not the end of it .
negative	i have had to pay an extra courier cost for collection and they will not give me a replacement or refund until the product has_been returned to them for what they say ' testing '.
negative	on their website it does not state that this will be the case if you have to return any product on the contriary it states the opposite as it says " dont worry , if you have a faulty item we will arrange to either replace or refund , standard 00 days no_quibble returns_policy ".
negative	i '_m afraid this is not the case at all .
negative	they also trade on ebay and on viewing the feedback there , which i wish i had before purchasing anything from this so called company , there is alot of negative_feedback which just confirms my experience , no goods , no refund , extra costs ......... buyers_beware .............
negative	very disappointed with my canvas .
negative	the colours are darker_than my photo .
negative	i ordered a game for a christmas_present 00th_december_0000 .
negative	needless to say it didn_'_t come through in time , and upon_checking the website it was out of stock .
negative	no communication , nothing .
negative	i emailed asking for a refund .
negative	no response .
negative	0st_march_0000 , i finally receive the game !!
negative	that '_s almost three_months with no communication whatsoever !!
negative	what a joke .
negative	appalled at the customer service , i bought an item in store as a gift it was the wrong_size , so i went back to exchange for larger_size there were none available in store but it was available on line , but the store could not order from online or transfer stock from another store , so all i could have was a credit_note which i could not use online either , i just had to hope that the size i required came in stock at the store .
negative	i e_- mailed the customer service , after 00 days i got a reply and all it kept going on about was the returns_policy for unsuitable gifts .
negative	the gift was not unsuitable i just required a larger_size .
negative	while waiting for a response to my e_- mail i contacted the customer service by phone i was told i could purchase the size required on - line and pay again and have it delivered to my home address , then for me to go to the store with the correct sized item , invoice and credit_note , the store would then refund me for the delivered product and for me then to purchase back the product with the credit_note .
negative	i was told the store would be contacted and informed on what had been agreed .
negative	when i went back to the store i explained what i had been told , i was informed that nothing was noted regarding this and if this had been agreed they would of been informed so they would have to ring through to customer_services to confirm this agreement , i was made to feel that i was trying to pull a fast one .
negative	i cannot_believe the messing_about i have had to do all because the product was the wrong_size if i had purchased the product on - line to start with and it was the wrong_size i could have taken it back to the store and got a refund straight_away .
negative	i would not recommend purchasing any clothing from a superdry store unless the person_who it for has tried it on before purchasing .
negative	booked online and paid but the parcel never got collected .
negative	when i rang to complain i wasn_'_t given an explanation .
negative	would certainly never use again .
negative	horrible company will never use ever again not customer based just god awful in general not plesant at all .
negative	very condisending .
negative	signal problems never listened to the problem and just presented written excuses .
negative	poor company in general .
negative	i have only just found the list of people disatisfied with this company ... too late as i too have experienced the same probems ... no reply to emails .
negative	premium number phone number with no ability to speak to anyone and no goods ... so do not use this company
negative	i have used serenata before and they have been great .
negative	i decided to order some flowers for my grandma '_s birthday last_week and they didn_'_t just come very late in the day but the quality of the flowers were awful .
negative	they ' re already dying and only received them on thursday .
negative	i have been really impressed with their service but unfortunately after this i will not be using them again .
negative	0 visits to the store .... 0 hours 00_mins on the phone to customer_services , this is my last attempt to call them as i type this i am on song no 0 !!
negative	have listened to 0 advertisements .
negative	you are talking to someone in india .. they put you on hold constantly while they ' talk to a supervisor ; ( speak for wait while i talk to other customers !!)
negative	they will ring you back in an_hour .. thats happened 0 times and still_waiting for a single call back .....
negative	they will prioritise you complaint and sort it within 00_hours ... now onto song number 0 !!!!!!
negative	avoid at all costs !!!!
negative	the only_reason they have 0_star is because you cant leave a review without leaving at_least 0_star otherwise it would be - 0
negative	placed an order and paid for next_day delivery .
negative	got an_email the following_morning to say that the order was delayed .
negative	emailed beautybay ( who have still not replied ).
negative	order received but a day late , no reply from beautybay and no refund of my postage cost .
negative	ordered on thurs_00th was informed item was despatched on the 00th first_class_post .
negative	hadn_'_t recieved item on the 00st so i phoned stitcher .
negative	i was told they had a problem with internet_connection so it wasn_'_t despatched until 00th .
negative	needless to say i won_'_t be shopping with stitcher again .
negative	very poor service !!!
negative	!
negative	bought an item and used credit_card to pay , seller failed to deliver .
negative	took it up with paypal who refused to refund because he was no_longer an ebay member .
negative	then they closed the dispute and stopped_talking .
negative	so i took it up with my credit_card and got money back !
negative	then funnily_enough paypal wanted to talk again when they lost their money .
negative	so i stopped_talking to them !
negative	beware , don_'_t pay for anything over_£_000 with adebit card their money back guarantee means nothing !
negative	i ordered a seal for my washing_machine , on the website the picture_shown was exactly_what i needed and it stated it was a genuine part however upon fitting this seal to my machine it was missing an integeral part , i emailed part_master with no response so i called them to find out they wouldn_'_t refund me or send me the correct seal , as i had fitted it into my wachine , which any one would do thinking the right genuine part was sent , it was part masters mistake for sending me the wrong part , and they won_'_t refund or replace this redundant seal i spent over_£_00 on , i held up my end of the bargain by entering all the correct info and paying so it '_s only fair they send me what i paided for , if you want to be ripped_off and fobbed_off then part_master is the place to order !
negative	!
negative	tried to order .
negative	told card blocked .
negative	contact bank .
negative	bank say card not blocked company not processed properly .
negative	company would not accept this and said bank at fault .
negative	i said i therefore wished to cancel order and received email cancelling so i ordered with another company who processed payment without a problem and delivered order .
negative	i then get messages from city_link that the appliance direct company order was on its way .
negative	i contact them to ask why when i have cancelled and they sent another email_confirming it was cancelled .
negative	city_link then try to deliver and i refused to sign for it and told them to return to company .
negative	then whilst on holiday company deliver to neighbour and take money from my bank_account the same bank_account they argued was blocked and now i can get no reply from the company whatsoever .
negative	i ordered a bag mid_october for a present .
negative	several e_mails saying the order had been delayed still no bag by november .
negative	so i asked for a refund , 0 e_mails later still no refund and they had stopped_replying to my e_mails .
negative	even after a phone_call they were unable to e_mail me back to explain_why the money had not been refunded .
negative	after 0_months i have not received my money back !
negative	would not use this this firm as they are incapable of doing what they say .
negative	wish i had spotted these reviews 0_weeks_ago !!!!!
negative	when i placed an order ......................... which guess_what ?
negative	i haven_'_t received , like the other people on this site i have telephoned and sent emails - no response . the phone line just tells you to email them .
negative	do not use this company !!
negative	!
negative	the new capsules don_'_t fit on the my coffee_machine .
negative	i was very disappointed with the daffodils i had purchased especially as i had upgraded the bouquet to a larger one .
negative	they arrived and were all fully open and dying with some already dead .
negative	i had expected the daffodils to arrive in a similar state as you would purchase them in a shop , a mixture of unopened and just starting to open flowers so they could be enjoyed for a number of days .
negative	when you send flowers it is usually for a significant reason and i was disappointed to find out the gesture was of shadowed by the poor quality of the flowers .
negative	couple this with the expense of sending daffodils ( in comparison to the couple of pounds you can buy them for in a shop ) i would not recommend serenataflowers . com .
negative	i purchased an item on 00th_november delivery within 00 days , even_though they were charging extortionate £ 0 . 00 for a small item you would think it would be sent first_class recorded .
negative	however since then nothing , obviously the two_weeks has past and i have sent two emails and i am still none the wiser .
negative	in times of recession people can '_t afford to have their money taken from them especially when the voucher was a gift for a date which has now passed .
negative	not acceptable and not worth the risk .
negative	i don_'_t see how hard it is to reply to an_email surely the profit from p_&_p is enough to pay for a customer_services team .
negative	i originally thought this was a good site but that '_s when you redeem from 0rd_party suppliers .
negative	when you redeem direct from wowcher you '_ve basically lost your money !
negative	flowers came with brown patches , flowers looked like they were already dying , set them up for my mum for when she returned home and she asked if i had hidden them in a cupboard for a few day without water !!
negative	when they had only just been delivered , card was all bent !!
negative	was not worth the money , and has put me of ordering again :(
negative	they refused to guarantee a driver who rude and intimidating to myself ( i was alone in the house with my baby ).
negative	would not be allowed to deliver to our house again .
negative	after sending written confirmation my monthly pass would be cancelled in nov_0000 they have just taken 0 payments for may and june_0000 despite not having ordered anything from them .
negative	do not use !
negative	got the bed and mattresses , better quality with 00yr guarantee from ikea at just over half the cost of this place .
negative	i used to love the bbc but lately i would not trust anything they say .
negative	all there reports are just to stir up trouble and cause unrest , to give them something to report on i suppose .
negative	marion my good friend had a significant birthday and i wanted to surprise her with a bouquet .
negative	she was delighted and rang me as soon as it was delivered .
negative	i can always_rely_on serenata for the wow_factor .
negative	do not buy anything off this company , once they have your money they wash their hands of you , ordered a fitted kitchen from them , free delivery , they couldn_'_t give me a time so i had to take a day off work , they came after i should have finished work so i lost a days pay for nothing , then an extremely rude little man dumped everything by my front_door and said they were only paid to deliver that far , i am a 00 year_old lady , i had to drag all the boxes in myself , i am_disgusted with b_& q thus is not customer service , i phoned them and they said it was the delivery firms fault and out of their hands , shame on you , avoid this firm at all costs !
negative	we have 0 0_seater leather_sofas .
negative	( eiger model ) only had them 0_months and find them very uncomfortable .
negative	sitting on the metal bar and springs and huge gap at back of cushion when sat on it .
negative	contacted customer_services who sent their inspector .
negative	he informed us that there was nothing wrong with the sofas and this is to be expected if you suit on them for more than 0 minutes .
negative	so now we have to go into debt to buy replacements .
negative	despite having an ann_summers in my area , i thought i would save myself some time by ordering online for my first valentines with my boyfriend .
negative	i placed an order for a lingerie set on the 00st of january , allowing plenty of time for valentines .
negative	my voucher_code wasn_'_t applied in my confirmation_email , so i rang customer_services to sort it out .
negative	a lovely lady made the necessary amendments and i continued to wait for the products to arrive .
negative	after 00 days ( on an apparently 0 - 0 working day standard delivery ), there was still no sign of the item , so emailed via the website .
negative	no reply .
negative	so i rang up and spent a good 00_minutes on hold .
negative	still no pick_up .
negative	so i rang the next_morning , and still spent 00_minutes on hold .
negative	so i emailed again .
negative	still no response .
negative	after 0 more emails and another 00_minutes total time on hold , i eventually got hold of a man from the team , at about 00pm on the 00th - only one day before valentines .
negative	he was very unhelpful and said that my order had been on hold .
negative	later on in the conversation when i questioned_why my package hadn_'_t been delivered , he blamed it on royal_mail ( contradicting his previous comments ).
negative	he then_proceeded to tell me that if ann_summers hadn_'_t been notified of a problem , they couldnt fix it .
negative	im not sure what else i was expected to do , having already sent 0 messages and clocked up a whopping hour ( plus ) of time on an 0000 number .
negative	eventually , after much grovelling , i had still no empathy , nor compensation for the fact that my valentines surprise for my boyfriend was no_longer arriving .
negative	he finished off the conversation by saying that the cancellation was fine , but the refund may take up to 00 days to get back into my account .
negative	he was very unapologetic and didn_'_t seem to care about my loyalty to the company .
negative	i am so gutted to have been treated so badly by what i had previously considered to be a fantastic company offering great products .
negative	i am still_waiting for my refund and wouldn_'_t be surprised if it took over the 00 working_days to get to me , considering the previous standard of service i have been subjected to .
negative	with a growing number of competing companies , i '_m surprised to have seen such appalling customer service .
negative	my advice : in store service is great , but if youre considering buying online , go elsewhere .
negative	its not worth the hassle .
negative	am £_000 down as returned 0 pairs of boots , no refund issued and company no_longer exist !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i tried my 00 year_old_son '_s costume on him and noticed it was ripped around the arm and it had a stain on the back . i sent it back for a refund and had an_email back stating that i had done the damage so i would not get a refund . i was appalled that i was accused of doing the damage and that i was not telling them the truth . i have neither a costume or refund now . i will never order from this site again .
negative	i would have given them zero star_rating if i could have .
negative	i have ordered 0 times over the last 0 years .
negative	with the first order , the price / quality / timescale and service were great .
negative	the 0nd order was good too .
negative	however our recent order has received a very poor level of quality and service .
negative	we ordered 0 specs and 0 extra cases .
negative	0 case was sent within 00 days but other 0 took several weeks of communication - and they seem to be sent from within the uk .
negative	glasses - quite another story - 0 pairs coming from hong_kong .
negative	0st pair took 0_weeks , arrived unusable as the nose_pads fitted serously incorrectly - the rma asked me to send pics , which i have but still_waiting on reply weeks_later .
negative	0nd specs arrived after 0_weeks and one lens was rattling loose in the case .
negative	not good .
negative	asked to send pics of it ... then asked to return them - postage would be refunded if it '_s a bonafide problem .
negative	specs arrived back 0 week_later but still not a great fit .
negative	0rd specs ( according to online progress ) sat in quality control for several weeks .
negative	they were eventually despatched and have still not arrived 0_weeks_later .
negative	really poor service .
negative	online chats always led me to being told to wait another 0_weeks for delivery .
negative	this was not a cheap order (£_000 ) to summarise :
negative	0 really unusable pair of spectacles
negative	0 uncomfortable pair of spectacles
negative	0 missing pair of spetacles ( the expensive ones )
negative	0 cases after several online conversations .
negative	and they , of course , took full payment up front .
negative	i have tried to contact select_specs but unable to as their site is down .
negative	i wonder_why they don_'_t have a telephone_number that they can be contacted on ...... just email .
negative	fax or online_chat , when available .
negative	i read the numerous recent poor reviews ( here and elsewhere ).
negative	we decided to ignore them as we have had good service in the past .
negative	we seriously regret placing business with them a 0rd time .
negative	granted they do offer apparently good frames at a resonable price .
negative	however that is if the goods arrive and in a usable condition .
negative	problems with one pair could be considered unlucky .
negative	of the 0 items ordered only 0 case arrived promptly without hastle , 0 pairs of specs are not being used and 0rd pair are still awol .
negative	are we just unlucky or has this company now got a problem with quality control and timescales ?
negative	i doubt we will be returning customers and definitely can '_t recommend selectspecs .
negative	there are plenty of other_companies to try .
negative	i am so disappointed and shocked at the treatment i have received from this company .
negative	i had been visiting a close friend on the occasion of her 00th_birthday and ordered her a bouquet in the hope that she would receive it whilst i was with her .
negative	unfortunately despite waiting all day it did not arrive .
negative	i immediately dispatched an_email asking what had happened , i received no reply .
negative	the flowers did arrive the following_morning along with a small box of chocolates by way of an_apology , the van had broken down .
negative	how this could result in the complete_lack of service on the specified day i fail to understand .
negative	my main_reason for choosing this company was the use of local retailers .
negative	despite sending a second email requesting some response i have still not heard from them .
negative	it is really against my nature to post a bad_review , but a response from the company was in my opinion the least i could expect .
negative	i thought i would try a new company for having flowers delivered and wish i hadn_'_t bothered !
negative	the problem started off as my fault but it was not handled as i think it should have been .
negative	i did not enter the full delivery address , missing the street name as i thought it was automatically inputted it .
negative	it turns_out this is not the case !
negative	however i did provide a contact telephone_number which was switched on and with me the entire day .
negative	i figured that if there was a problem that i would be contacted ..........
negative	sadly this was also not the case and i then spent 0 hrs in the late_afternoon trying to discover why my mums_birthday flowers had not been delivered to her and eventually found out that the next time this could be done would be monday meaning that they would sit for 0_days in a box in the depo !
negative	i was extremely upset about this and would be very much put off using the service again or recommending it to others .
negative	for months ive been advised i an eligible for an upgrade by text , i do as the text says , call in to which i wait for 00 - 00 - 00_minutes .
negative	i sit patiently ( remember i have a day job and dont sit on my backside all evening ) and still dont get through to anyone .
negative	like any sane human_being , i do eventually loose patience - and dont get me started on their choice of music .
negative	i am reminded my call is important to them !
negative	( apparently ) so after many months of trying i still have no luck ( obviously my problem as i dont have the patience to wait for over 00_minutes ).
negative	so i go to their wesbsite and see ' chat ', i think wow , this is amazing i can get immediate answers and actions .
negative	silly me , i am told i am eligible for an upgrade after we '_ve gone_through security ( well_done , i explained this in my opening paragraph ).
negative	i am then told theres a 00 minute wait times to speak to someone in upgrades ( on chat ).
negative	at this stage im at boiling point as it seems impossible to speak to anyone and get what i need .
negative	considering how painful this has_been and after over 00_yrs of loyalty i decide to leave o0 !
negative	i ask the person serving me how i do this , he states that theres a 00min wait for the cancellation team for chat and call .
negative	brilliant !
negative	so as we speak i am now waiting on hold ( on chat ) to speak to someone to cancel my contract .
negative	this is not customer service and its certainly not something i '_m willing to pay for month on month .
negative	my vodaphone contract and service is pretty_much golden in colour , whereas o0 and the lovely telefonica are a rather unpleasant brown !
negative	i would never recommend and will never use them again !
negative	dont buy from this company flowers are nothing like advertised on website totally disappointed might as well of gone and picked some weeds out of back garden .
negative	vase was ok . had instructions to leave with neighbour which i did not ask for , and didnt bother to even wait for door to be opened .
negative	they sent me an extortionately high bill stating that my energy use has tripled !!!!
negative	when i called and stated that i cannot imagine how i could have used that much energy , i was told that i simply have to pay the £_000 within the next 0_days .
negative	i refused this and cancelled my direct_debit .
negative	i was then offered to monitor my meter and take a reading at the same time of the day for the next 0_days , which i did .
negative	this showed my daily usage to average 0 units and not the alleged 00 !!!
negative	when i called back to report this , i was told that i still have to pay the £_000 but that i can spread this in my direct_debit over the next 00 months .
negative	i had to agree to this as the guy stated there was no other option .
negative	a couple of days_later i noticed that my meter had dropped more than 0000 units .
negative	again , i called edf and was then told that the meter might be faulty and that i now do not have to pay the £_000 and my monthly direct_debit has dropped right back down .
negative	no apology , no nothing .
negative	i will be changing energy_supplier !!
negative	!
negative	the worst customer service i have ever came_across .
negative	ordered a rocking_horse as xmas_present for my little_boy which have never received and now can not get my refund for 0_weeks !!
negative	first horse we ordered was delivered to the wrong_address and we been called liars as we apparently have received it and just saying we did not get it . after we have managed to prove it wasn_'_t us who signed for it they promised to send us a new toy , which again didn_'_t arrive on time .
negative	ended_up going to the shop and buying one as it was xmas_eve and still no horse for our boy .
negative	now we can not get our refund as it is apparently too difficult to give the refund for orders ordered online !!!
negative	thieves that '_s all i can say .. no toy no money and massive telephone bills after a number of phone_calls with no result still .
negative	shame on you mamas and papas !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered to my mother who_lives in the usa .
negative	she received them today and i am_disgusted to say that the flowers were wilted , half_dead and were in a vase of brown water !!!
negative	!
negative	i am_appalled by this and was not only irate when she called to tell me , but embarrassed and humiliated also .
negative	needless to say , the flowers looked nothing like they did in the pictures online and i would not recommend this website to anyone !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	to cut a long_story_short , do not use this website !
negative	to sum up in a few points :
negative	- flowers don_'_t look anything like what u see on the website , i mean totally different !
negative	- late !
negative	my sister didn_'_t receive her flowers until 00 : 00 !
negative	( birthday over )
negative	- no offer of compensation or even a discount on future_purchases .
negative	- didn_'_t even try to retain me as a customer .
negative	in summary don_'_t do it !
negative	contact interflora as i should have and will be doing from now on .
negative	i phoned to order part no .
negative	l0dab00 - 000 ( an instruction_manual for a logik dab_radio l0dab00 purchased for my husband for christmas ).
negative	i have been told that you are not able to supply this for me .
negative	i find this impossible to understand .
negative	; i am unable to set_up the radio for my husband and am desperate to obtain this instruction_manual .
negative	surely someone at partmaster could obtain this for me ?
negative	i placed an order fro over_£_000 of items .
negative	they seemed like a great price at first .
negative	i then paid for my items and waited for the order confirmation .
negative	i received the email and to my surprise there was an extra_charge of £_00 because i paid by mastercard . what a joke !
negative	this did not show clearly on the last ordering page .
negative	i phoned them within 0 minutes of placing the order and asked to cancel because of the card charge .
negative	they said i could cancel but i wouldnt get £_00 refunded !
negative	they also said that the order would still be dispatched as they couldnt contact the warehouse . i then asked what courier they would use so i could reject the parcel , and they couldnt give me those details either !
negative	john sharma the sales_guy , then said if i do sign for it accidently .
negative	then i would have to send it back at my cost , plus pay the cost of original delivery and then when it was received at the ilgs warehouse , i would have to pay an extra restocking charge of 00_% the total value of the order .
negative	never use this company .
negative	and if you check other forums , no one has anything good to say about them , i wish i checked before hand .
negative	at_least ive try to warn other people !
negative	we are still_waiting for our mattress !
negative	it was ordered on 00 march_0000 for deliery on
negative	00th_march .
negative	we then had a phone_call telling us that the mattress was out of stock
negative	and we would get an_email when it was available for delivery .
negative	im very annoyed about this delay as we should have been made aware that the item was out of stock before we made payment !
negative	terrible service i ordered flowers in good time and didn_'_t arrive on specific day i contacted eflorist who just told me i should have read small_print and used a florist if i wanted them for a specific day i felt the adviser was having a laugh at my expense .... they arrived a day late but wasn_'_t left even_though i left clear delivery instructions emails haven_'_t been answered .... please read other review sites to get a clear picture of this company ... they just don_'_t care about the customer when things go_wrong and ignore you
negative	it was reported back to me that the sympathy flowes that you delivered were very poor , the card that arrived with the flowers was blank so they didn_'_t know who sent them , thay had to be wrapped and ribbon put on them to make them anywhere_near presentable , you have caused severe embarrassment to me and iwill odge an official_complaint with your company , you only have one star to enable meto submit this review
negative	really happy with the quality of my product and it '_s the cheapest i have found them however , i did not appreciate the delivery driver leaving my product in the dust bin outside and not even leaving me a note to say he had been or where they were !!
negative	i had to phone customer_services to find out where my order was as i hadn_'_t heard from them for 00 days .
negative	the box was soaking_wet from the rain but luckily the boots were not damaged !
negative	management at tesco alloa , appalling .
negative	bitchy and getting other staff into trouble .
negative	good job there is employment lawyers .
negative	one rule for some and another rule for others .
negative	how come when all staff doing same thing and management being told by employees of this .
negative	one is dismissed .
negative	compass and tesco , have u even read the ethics policy at heart of your business ???
negative	?
negative	i ordered an item for my daughter but she did not receive it .
negative	the money was taken from my credit_card .
negative	i emailed you but did not get a reply . where is my item !
negative	?
negative	i put my watch ( tag_heuer alter ego ) with watchfinder to sell in january - they said they were confident that they could sell the watch within 0 - 0_weeks ........ however 0_months later there had been no sale or offers and no contact from watchfinder unless i contacted them first !
negative	i have since requested the return of my watch .
negative	i have been trying for 0_weeks to find out what is happening to the 0 orders i have made for flea and tick_treatment for my dogs .
negative	the phone is generally not answered , my e_mails do not get acknowledged or replied to .
negative	as things stand i have paid this company nearly 00 pounds , have not seen any goods and am rapidly running out of any hope of doing so .
negative	we measured all our ushers for their waistcoats and every one of them we ordered came up a size smaller and so non fitted , we were able to shuffle round and order more but its been a nightmare to be hones ... very unhappy customer
negative	awful experience bad customer service too
negative	after making my booking and payment , i didn_'_t receive any notification of when the fitter would arrive .
negative	i made several calls and sent several emails .
negative	i was treated as if i was an annoyance , before the fitter finally arrived at 0 :_00pm .
negative	the tyres were fitted in the dark which i was not happy about .
negative	i received a half - hearted apology and that was all .
negative	i will not be using etyres again and i would not recommend them based on this poor experience .
negative	item turned_up in a shoe box , not an " attractive gift box " as_described .
negative	the bottle of red_wine was missing and the box was far too_big for the contents so the glass_jars knocked around against each other .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	flowers arrived , roses contained 0 limp roses .
negative	lillies were closed and not bloomed , looked really ugly displayed in a wrapped up brown sheeting , which was really crinkled by the person wrapping , lots of selotape tied around the bottom , looked total disgrace .
negative	would never order from here again .
negative	waste of money .
negative	ordered 0 pairs of glasses .
negative	received one pair 00 days after ordering .
negative	rubbish quality - cheap is not the word .
negative	lenses fabricated incorrectly , absolutely unusable .
negative	waited for the other pair of glasses to see if they were the same , but they never turned_up .
negative	on the packaging of the pair that i did receive , i saw that the glasses were originally made in pakistan , then sent to a uk organisation , then another uk organisation before being dispatched to me .
negative	if i would have known about this , i would never have ordered anything with them .
negative	if i buy a product off a uk website then i expect the product to be fabricated in the uk unless clearly_stated otherwise .
negative	this was not the case here .
negative	i do not consider glasses made in the back of beyond in pakistan to be acceptable quality at all .
negative	i have been in touch with customer service tonight , so have yet to sort this out .
negative	i get the impression that this is not the type of company that will take my complaints and concerns on board and refund my money though .
negative	so , i have lost my money .
negative	but hopefully my review here can prevent others making the same mistake .
negative	avoid at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	i have wore this perfume for years and this is the only bottle i have had that loses it '_s scent after 00mins of putting it on , don_'_t waste your money on a snide
negative	i was incredibly disappointed with the mytub service & would not recommend them .
negative	we ordered our item without choosing to pay extra delivery charge for a speedier order , but were nonetheless promised a lead time of 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	in the end we had to wait over 0_weeks for delivery , with mytub '_s suggested solution being that we shoiuld pay the extra delivery charge for quicker delivery anyway !
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	because of this poor service our bathroom work was severely delayed .
negative	incredibly disappointing - and no reimbursement or anything_else offered by way of apology .
negative	flowers were sent half_dead and very small , ordered balloons but they didn_'_t even turn_up .
negative	very difficult to get_hold of them on the phone , waited for an_hour to finally get through , sent a pic like they asked but they wouldn_'_t refund !
negative	do not use this company !!
negative	very bad service and terrible flowers !
negative	waste of £_00 !
negative	the title is what i see too often on the argos website .
negative	why advertise products that are not in stock online and not available in store .
negative	a completely_different product was sent than i ordered .
negative	then i had to return it and wait for the correct order .
negative	from ordering to completing was several weeks .
negative	i also ordered a cd which took 00 days to arrive .
negative	i will be using amazon in future .
negative	is that true ?
negative	i want to write a negative_review of dietchef as i am very angry about the service i have received and you won_'_t let_me .
negative	not sure_whether they sell second - hand good as ' new ', but i ordered a phone and it came with just the phone and charger in a box - no instruction_manual or anything .
negative	they really screwed_up my delivery by failing ensure that the correct instructions were on the parcel .
negative	this caused me immense inconvenience and ruined a weekend ( it was a birthday_gift for a friend ).
negative	i paid a large_amount for next_day delivery for the privilege .
negative	when i complained , they were rude and sarcasitc and did not deal with my complaint in a professional_manner .
negative	they also absoutely refused to answer my question about whether the phone should have an instruction_manual with it .
negative	they did not refund any postage either .
negative	incredibly incompetent people , and zero customer service .
negative	the way that a company treats their customers is one of the best indicators of whether they are worth dealing_with .
negative	it is fine to have cheap prices , but i would rather pay more to have the confidence that any_problems will be dealt_with satisfactorily .
negative	i would advise anyone against using this company , as they are only interested in the sale , absolutely no regard for their customers , or take any responsiblity in the event of a problem .
negative	i purchased beyonce_tickets row a .
negative	0_days before they concert i receive an_email_saying they can '_t contact the seller so they are offering me new tickets which are not as good seats .
negative	i say i will accept these but i expect the price difference back .
negative	they are currently refusing to give me the price difference !
negative	i paid £_000_per original ticket , the tickets they are offering me now are still on their website for £_000 each so surely they have to refund me the difference ?
negative	apparently not !
negative	i am so upset and so disappointed in this service .
negative	i have been looking_forward to this for months .
negative	my flight time got pushed back by 0_days and i asked for a refund and some compensation towards booking a new flight since they notified me last_minute and flight costs have doubled in price ( i couldn_'_t take the new flight since i had a connecting_flight with the original flight ).
negative	the customer service lady ....( name ) ( sp ?)
negative	was very rude and confrontational saying they are not responsible since it '_s the airline '_s fault and won_'_t do anything to appease the situation .
negative	finally they agreed to issue me the refund but said it will take 00 days to get the money back !!!!
negative	worst service ever ...
negative	i will never book with them again !!
negative	!
negative	here '_s my feedback of which you ask me to comment on , you don_'_t say which product im supposed to be commenting on , normally i receive good service on whatever i purchase , the most_recent_purchase which was a dog_harness , was usless , and dangerous as it would unclip itself as i was walking my dog , although you sent another to replace it , it is exactly the same , and i wouldn_'_t recommend anyone to purchase it , sorry but its the truth
negative	i ordered at 0 :_00pm , because the website promised same day delivery for orders placed before 0 :_00pm .
negative	received an_email late_afternoon saying delivery not possible .
negative	offered me an ' upgrade ' for free for the next_day ....
negative	but i declined and asked for a refund .
negative	same day delivery should be same day ....
negative	the next_day would have been the wrong day , so that was useless for me .
negative	refund will apparently take around 0 to 0_days ... don_'_t yet know if that will happen smoothly .
negative	i hope so .
negative	will not be using this company again .
negative	i had a very bad_experience with iflorist and will never use them again .
negative	i arranged for a sympathy_bouquet to be sent to a friend , ordered sunday 00th_december for delivery 00rd , which was the funeral of my friends husband .
negative	suffice to say it was not delivered ....
negative	i spoke to people on the ' live_chat ' and they were almost mechanical in their response ....
negative	i was told it would be delivered christmas_eve , again nothing .
negative	then they closed for christmas and the promise of an upgraded bouquet was ordered for the 00th ... again nothing and the same thing for 00th_december .
negative	after this i demanded a refund , which was done promptly .
negative	but , i am amazed_at the appalling lack of customer service .
negative	there was never any contact and i was never told why they hadn_'_t gone and no apologies .
negative	i would steer well clear .
negative	i bought a pair of shoes at a remarkable discount .
negative	received the shoes , didn_'_t fit .
negative	now as anyone will know who shops online , the usual procedure is that you let the company know the shoes didn_'_t fit , and they come and collect them whilst delivering another pair .
negative	i had no clue how to get a refund with groupon , so i contacted them and a week or so later i got an_email requesting details and to reply back to help @ groupon . co . uk ( or something like that ) and then a week_later i was informed i had sent it to the u . s groupon ( even_though i did send it to the uk ) so i emailed the uk again .
negative	after a lot of timely and annoying back - and - fro i eventually got the info i needed to contact the vendor .
negative	the vendor then informed me that i would be charged to send my shoes back as the postage would be at my own_expense .
negative	this was about 0_weeks after receiving my shoes and to avoid hassle i never returned them .
negative	groupon need to make_sure they have the vendors refund policy clearly_stated on groupons website , and have a more efficient help system .
negative	i am very dissapointed and will never buy from them again in fear of not liking the product .
negative	the good deals are countered by the rubbish service .
negative	beware .
negative	in april_0000 , i ordered a double sink vanity_unit , back to the wall_toilet and back to the wall cupboard unit from onlinebathrooms , at a total_cost of £_000 . 00 including shipping .
negative	i was very happy with my items .
negative	last_week , i went back on to the website to order the matching mirror unit .
negative	to cut a long and infuriating story_short , the mirror was only available as an add - on to the vanity_unit at a cost of £_000 .
negative	when i rang to try and order it separately they updated the website to list it as a separate item but increased the price to £_000 !!
negative	i make that 00_% increase .
negative	when i complained they said they '_d had a price increase from their supplier which they hadn_'_t known about until i called .
negative	despite me explaining that surely that wasn_'_t my fault they refused to sell the mirror at the advertised price and i have been forced to contact consumer_direct for advice .
negative	there are so many bathroom companies selling online so my advice is avoid this lot and shopping elsewhere .
negative	the gift didn_’_t turn_up
negative	they took - stole ?
negative	- my money
negative	they didn_’_t answer emails
negative	useless company with less_than poor customer_relations .
negative	mage til dårlig service skal man lede længe efter !!
negative	jeg_har handlet en del på_nettet og altid fået varer leveret til_tiden og_har_jeg returneret noget , har_jeg fået mine penge promte retur .
negative	men ikke hos zalando .
negative	her skal man åbenbart ringe forgæves mange gange , hvor man_får at vide , at pengene er på kontoen om et_par dage , men nej !
negative	nu har_jeg ventet , ringet , skrevet og_der_er gået en måned siden , jeg returnerede min_pakke .
negative	øv !
negative	et skod firma !
negative	det_er første og sidste_gang , jeg_handler der !
negative	i was depending_on these flowers and cards to arrive in time for my grandmother to see them before going into hospital for a risky operation .
negative	i paid_extra for same day delivery and had a note from all the members of my family to my grandmother that we all were banking on her being_able to read in case she didn_'_t make it through .
negative	i then get an_email just before the cut_off time for same day delivery saying the address was wrong so the delivery had not been made and asking me for yet more money to cover the costs as apparently the company had driven out to the address to deliver the flowers before realising it didn_'_t exist .
negative	having sent many many packages and flowers in the past to this address with no problem or lack of delivery before i called the email sender to enquire how this had happened .
negative	the automated process for local deliveries was explained to me as was the policy .
negative	very upset that the package wasn_'_t going to make it in time for my grandmother to see it , i spoke to the manager who repeated the same policy and process .
negative	no solutions were offered to actually provide the service i had asked of them , i was just told the policy over and over and informed that the flowers would go out the next door and " hopefully " would arrive by 0pm when i told them already that of course no one would be in to receive the flowers as she was in hospital .
negative	the whole service was poor and the experience even worse .
negative	not only is the automated process of taking only the postcode from an address and giving that to a local_florist fundamentally flawed but the customer service was extremely poor showing no sign of understanding , empathy or service ( aside from getting more money from me to pay for a service they hadn_'_t delivered ).
negative	if i had had this problem before with the address then fine , but i have not .
negative	if they checked the full address beforehand instead of half the postcode , they also would have avoided this unfortunate situation .
negative	to then just repeat the policy and process at me over and again instead of looking to find a solution especially when i was clearly upset just showed the poorest service and lack of care .
negative	i didn_'_t find them rude as they dispassionately told me about the policy and the process but i did find the whole_experience unreasonable and totally_unacceptable .
negative	i ordered some flowers for my mum for mother '_s day , and picked next say delivery , i was told they would be delivered sat 00th_march and also had an_email_confirming this .
negative	saturday went and i sent 0 emails chasing them up with no reply , sunday came and went and another 0 emails with no reply !!
negative	the flowers finally turned_up on monday after mother '_s day and as they had obviously been in transit for days we ' re half_dead !!
negative	a phone_call made and staff were so unhelpful but have me a managers email , i emailed saying i wanted a refund , had no reply !!
negative	disgusting service !!
negative	surfice to say i will be taking this further
negative	had a very bed experience with e_- bookers and not sure i will ever use them again .
negative	i had lots of charges going off my account , including an 0 pounds charge to e_- bookers which i had no knowledge about .
negative	after_reading all the great reviews about menapol_plus i was hoping for great things !!!
negative	almost 0_weeks on im still_waiting !!!
negative	!
negative	ordered 0 big_boy bean_bags for my daughter '_s for christmas on 0th_november .
negative	told they would be with us week 00 before christmas and they didn_'_t arrive .
negative	then told week 0 but that has now gone and now have heard it going to be by end of february .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	they keep offering me vouchers but i would never ever use this company again .
negative	they are a total let_down , the customer service is nil and they make promises they cannot keep !
negative	do not order from this company .
negative	they took on too many orders and cannot now deliver .
negative	they should have stopped the offer when they reached a level they could cope with - not rocket_science just sensible trading !
negative	!
negative	ordered a se bo vacuum on line which said was in stock and would be despatched and that the courier would email delivery !!
negative	a week_later no email so i called customer_services to be told it was out of stock !!
negative	why didnt the computer at time of sale , state out of stock , instead of in stock !!!
negative	after many calls to customer_services and threatening to cancel my order , to not very helpful employees , i received my vacuum_cleaner 0_weeks_later !!
negative	wouldn_'_t buy from them again , dreading if anything_goes_wrong !!
negative	after care service - don_'_t think they have one !!
negative	!
negative	i order flowers for my friend to cheer_her up , but they never arrived , and when i tried to find out why and get my money back the aftersales service was even worse .
negative	i will never order from this company ever again and will tell everyone else not to either .
negative	they cut_off my father '_s phone for non - payment when he had just come out of hospital .
negative	he died at home alone 0_days_later , unable to use his community alarm because his phone was cut_off .
negative	i had contacted them but they would do nothing on my say - so , wanted to hear from an ill 00 year - old .
negative	my dad was a decorated ww0 veteran with a heart of gold , but they didn_'_t care
negative	( social worker and home care manager plus nhs also at fault , but that does not excuse bt .)
negative	used to give me a really hard time because i wouldn_'_t set_up a direct_debit .
negative	if my bill wasn_'_t paid the day it was written i was blamed for late payment .
negative	finally , over 0_months after i left them they twice used my debit_card_details to take money from my account - " by mistake ".
negative	they did return it , but why were they retaining my card_details ????
negative	?
negative	ps - they may deny it but they are part of british_gas - the amounts debited from my account were listed as british_gas .
negative	failed me completely .
negative	i have a perfect 000_% rating after over 000 transactions but they believe a seller who failed to deliver hence i lose £_000 and repeatedly close my case .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	they first uplifted my parcel in november - failed to deliver but claimed they put a card through my door - they did not , i have a metal mail box , nothing gets lost .
negative	i had to pay the sender to send again .
negative	next uplifted on 00th_dec - now they claim they delivered on 00th to my workplace - nothing but lies !!!
negative	after hours of fruitless calls and e_-_mails i went to their depot .
negative	manager there admits that they accidentally loaded it with amazon returns , but their tracking continued to claim they delivered to be .
negative	ebay ( where it was unfortunately bought :- customer protection - don_'_t make me laugh ) says because yodel tracking shows it was delivered , i must be lying so they repeatedly close my case .
negative	this item is antique , rare , irreplaceable , fragile , lost !
negative	i am £_000 out of pocket with no hope of making a claim .
negative	i '_m going to police .
negative	i placed an online order on 0 december , trusting the online statement of " free 0 day delivery "... this is not the case ... and is totally misleading .
negative	it is now 0 jan_0000 and l am still_waiting for the mattress for the bed .
negative	constant phone_calls and unanswered email messages all to no_avail , l am still_waiting .
negative	will never use these people again nor will l recommend them to anyone .
negative	i was thinking i needed to get new nets but hadn_'_t got around to it when i saw some samples you had sent to my daughter - in - law and i liked what i saw so went home , measured and ordered .
negative	couldn_'_t be more pleased with the result .
negative	i ordered them a little over a week_ago .
negative	my son_loves this brand and the price was very reasonable .
negative	well maybe not so cheap if you don_'_t actually get any shoes after_spending over_£_00 .
negative	i was going to email and ask for a refund to be honest if they didn_'_t arrive within the next couple of days
negative	i placed my order with blackleaf , having seen the particular lingerie set in a feature with hello magazine .
negative	that hello article gave a discount_code that could be used if the order was placed within a specific timeframe . my order was placed in that timeframe , but the discount_code was not accepted on line so i did not get the 00_%_discount . i still went_ahead . i knew when i placed the order that the item would not be dispatched until approx 00rd feb , which was fine . i then received an e_mail from customer_services asking if i did still want to proceed with the order in view of dispatch delay . i immediately replied to that e_mail , to confirm the order . in that e_mail i asked that someone should please look into and contact me to explain_why the discount_code was not accepted . to date , no one has bothered to do so . this was my first order from blacckleaf . at this rate , i am unlikely to place another order
negative	i purchased a beauty treatment through wowcher over 0_weeks_ago , it was cancelled by the client and wowcher emailed me to let_me know i would receive a refund within 0 - 00days .
negative	i have yet to receive any money back despite sending them 0 emails and calling twice and requesting a call back , but still nothing .
negative	i would rate this company a 0 .
negative	i ordered the arrangement a week before christmas to be delivered on the 00nd .
negative	it was not delivered until the week_later .
negative	this was a christmas center piece which was useless after the holidays .
negative	there was no card or note from us in the delivery so my parents did not know who sent it until i asked if they recieved it and ther was no name of the florist .
negative	i would have appreciated an e_- mail if they knew they would be late and figure_out a way to change the order to something that was more appropriate for the new year !!!
negative	i will never use this web_site or florist again unless i get a refund !
negative	never received my order , when they kept emailing me , i gave them an order for my dog flea_treatment , was told next_day it would arrive , and 0_days_later nothing , it took them all afternoon to email back , i wont use them again , but the emails were polite .
negative	i had flowers delivered to my friend and neighbour on thursday 00nd aug by lunch_time friday_00rd roses were dead and carnations were not far behind .
negative	i was also very surprised at how small the bunch was .
negative	could have got similar size for around £ 0 . 00 at a supermarket .
negative	i am very disappointed .
negative	i have ordered from serenata_flowers before - i know one lot was fine as they were for my daughter and she would have made me aware of any_problems .
negative	i just hope the others were .
negative	not sure if i would use again .
negative	i would not recommend oak_furniture_land after the very poor customer service .
negative	it took several telephone_calls and emails before the issue was resolved .
negative	after promising to deliver the furniture within 0_weeks , i had to chase them for a delivery date , only to be told they could not deliver for a further 0_weeks and would not deliver on a day that was suitable for me .
negative	despite me offering 0 different and reasonable delivery solutions , i was basically told either take the day we ' re offering you or leave it .
negative	when i asked for my complaint to be escalated to a senior level , they refused .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	unacceptable experience .
negative	now the weather you cannot do anything about , however , information and customer service , that is another matter .
negative	poor quality food .
negative	poor attitudes of staff .
negative	overall waste of money , product sold ( mini_cruise ) not what was delivered .
negative	whitewash when highlighted to customer_care team , blanket response , wholly unacceptable .
negative	was so pleased when i saw the item i wanted to purchase on your item was in stock and ordered it on the 00th of dec as your colleague said it would arrive in time .
negative	however the day after it was dispatched ( so snowing said ) i tried to track it for four days , when i contacted snowing they took days to find out it was lost and by that time it was too late to order elsewhere , very very disappointing for my husband .
negative	i would never order anything from your company again
negative	can i have an e_mail to confirm my hotel is booked ?
negative	i asked for next_day delivery in time for sons_birthday - but didnt come until 0_days_later
negative	i ordered 0 games on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	one arrived and there was a note to say the other one more or less would be posted around 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	i have phoned 0 times and this morning the person i spoke to said she would get in touch with the warehouse and get back to me .
negative	she has not .
negative	i am totally fed_up with the service i have received and if ever i get this game i shall not be ordering from them again .
negative	order hp000000 .
negative	bitterly_disappointed and the florist was extremely rude
negative	this was one if the worse holidays i '_ve ever had completely miss sold it was told a 0_star hotel was more like a 0 my complaint was brushed under the table will never use these again
negative	terrible bunch of flowers , dead or dying .
negative	for nearly_£_00 i '_m massively disappointed .
negative	the flowers finally arrived past 0pm and we stayed in all day waiting for them .
negative	the driver did not speak a word of english !!
negative	upon_opening the box i thought that someone had replaced the bouquet from the local_garage .
negative	there were about 0 flowers only , for £_00 ?
negative	neve use them again
negative	if only i '_d read the reviews before i placed my order .
negative	i ordered a special thank - you gift of sunflowers , prosecco & a teddy_bear for my daughter and family at vast expense .
negative	i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered yesterday evening but they didn_'_t arrive ( i had of course to spoil the surprise as i had to ask my daughter if anything had come ).
negative	i emailed and phoned and after hanging on for ages and then being cut_off i finally got through to someone_who gave a half - hearted apology and said she would ring me in the morning to tell me what had happened .
negative	no - one rang .
negative	i emailed again and then rang them myself .
negative	no - one could explain what had happened but i was told that the delivery would be made this evening instead .
negative	surprise_surprise !
negative	no delivery again .
negative	i have just spoken to them and have been promised a re - delivery next tuesday !
negative	( with fresh flowers ) they say they have refunded the delivery charge and also the cost of the teddy_bear but after_reading all the reviews i '_ll believe it when / if it happens .
negative	i agree with everyone else - always read_reviews first , and never use this company
negative	shocking to be ripped_off £_00 at airport to get boarding card because i could not download it a home , through confused message about the password .
negative	also nearly_missed plane because the admin of purchasing a boarding card took so long .
negative	never travel with you again .
negative	jo robinson
negative	.
negative	wow congratulations towsure for the worst customer service i have received in a long time !
negative	in stock items didn_'_t arrive so i phoned to chase_up the order .
negative	told it had been out of stock but assured it would be sent out that day for delivery 0_days_later .
negative	shock and surprise no delivery so i phone the next_day to find out where it was and told very sorry but they had lied , my order had not been sent out and they would call to let_me know what was going on .
negative	an_hour later , still no call back , eventually they leave a message to say my order is still out of stock and what would ilike them to do .
negative	obviously fuming , i phone the next_day to cancel and get a refund only to be told that i can '_t get a refund for my whole order because part of it had been sent out yesterday .
negative	funny that i can '_t get a refund on an item that i don_'_t have , haven_'_t signed for and up to the point of delivery is not my property by law !
negative	trading_standards will be getting a letter from me about the company .
negative	in short .
negative	they just stopped my internet one day ( the same day i paid for the previous month ).
negative	it just stopped , nothing .
negative	i spent about a week back and forth with their customer service who blamed my computers and router constantly ( despite the problem happening on multiple computers and 0 routers ).
negative	when i finally got to speak to technical_support they laughed at the customer support and then told me they haven_'_t done any of the internal tests they said they were doing .
negative	after technical_support done their tests they told me it was their problem as their system wasn_'_t accepting my username and password and if it wasn_'_t fixed the next_day to phone them .
negative	i phoned the next_day and i was back to square one , they were asking me to reset my router and other stupid tests i had already done .
negative	i got my mac code from them and it never worked so i had to outright cancel it .
negative	avoid talk_talk
negative	evil company , take your belongings and do not honour the agreement and do not pay you any of the money you are owed , and refuse to have contact with .
negative	i will be taking the company to a small - claims court , so look_forward to hearing from me soon jack williams .
negative	theft and fraud is illegal , and you won_'_t get away with it .
negative	bottelino '_s - yate .
negative	has_been open about 0 - 0_weeks so thought we would give it a try .
negative	arrived at about 0000 without booking and we were told there would be a 0 min .
negative	wait while they cleaned and set a table .
negative	asked to wait in the bar area and get a drink .
negative	ok so far .
negative	on ordering our drinks we were told that it could not be added to our meal bill as we did not have a table allocated to us yet .
negative	on saying that we were told to wait in bar while the table was laid there must be a tablke number allocated and please could the drinks be put on bill .
negative	refused and had to pay for drinks at bar , had just paid when we were then shown to a table .
negative	ordered food 0 x calamari fritti starters £ 0 . 00 each 0 x linguini marianari @ £_00 . 00 0 x sirloin_steak med / rare @ 00 . 00 and a misto ( mixed salad ) @ £ 0 . 00
negative	calamari arrivedi in cold bowls , with wedge of lemon and mayonaise .
negative	no garnish ?
negative	0 bowl contained 0 pieces and the other 0 0 / 0 pieces effectively £ 0 per piece .
negative	it was obviously from frozen and had been deep fried badly as was soggy , not nice at all and most was left .
negative	mains arrived linguini marianara ( clams , prawns , tuna garlic and tomato_sauce .
negative	again cold bowl and food only just tepid the ingredients were not fresh , tuna tinned as you could taste and smell brine as you bit into it , clams i suggest were from a jar as tasted of vinegar , prawns frozen rather_than fresh , garlic and tomato_sauce watery and linguini was swimming in it .
negative	steak was ok med / rare , chips were ok but again both steak and chips arrived on cold plate and cold bowl .
negative	misto salad arrived yes this time correctly in a cold bowl but was drenched in olive_oil even_though it had not been asked for and believe me it was floating and quite unedible .
negative	my husband asked for some english mustard and on arrival the ramekin which it came in had 0 huge chips out of the edge of it , although i am sure it had been cleaned it did not look so .
negative	whilst attempting to eat our starter we were asked if our food was ok . both my husband and i had our mouths full and therefore did not reply immediately , by the time my husband had finished his mouthful to reply we had been tutted at as if it were us that were being rude for not replying and the waiter was walking away .
negative	my husband commented that the starter was not thst good and the waiter ( who we later found out was the duty_manager ) came back and said he wasn_'_t walking away .
negative	my husband explained that both he and i had a mouthful of food and were therefore unable to reply and he simply walked_away .
negative	at the end of what was a grotesque meal we asked to speak to the manager and we were somewhat surprised when the same chap arrived who had been so rude earlier .
negative	we started by again saying that the quality of food was very poor and our complaints had gone unnoticed .
negative	we pointed_out the state of the crockery and were told that he hadn_'_t noticed the chipped edges when he brought to the table even_though they were unmissable due to their size , he said he only brought ot and the chef was resposible for filling the ramekin so he obviously had not noticed either .
negative	we complained about serving food on cold plates .
negative	this manager guy was very rude to us and did not accept that they had done anything wrong , he did agree that the chipped ramekin would be thrown_away , but would not accept that the food was served on cold plates .
negative	he also said that the policy is for people to pay for their drinks at the bar or leave their credit / debit_card behind the bar incase " people did a runner " our point was that we were waiting for a table and wanted 0 bill .
negative	after cheap frozen , canned , jarred and cold food .
negative	i would avoid at all costs .
negative	finally no reduction on bill or anything complimentary , really bad service / food / place .
negative	placed order on 00thmarch 0000 .
negative	item showing as in stock with 0 - 0_days delivery , ( i therefore chose not to pay for next_day delivery ) and expected the watch within a week .
negative	on 0nd_april_0000 i was informed that the watch would be with me beginning / middle of next week , this would mean at_least ten days delevery .
negative	on 00th_april_0000 ( 00 days since order ) still no sign of watch i therefore raised ' a support ticket ' to find out what was happening , asking why it was taking so long , why web did not show when out of stock , what did they mean by beginning / middle of next week etc . etc .
negative	00th_april_0000 reply_saying sorry etc .
negative	etc_., but having supply problem .
negative	not answering any of my questions .
negative	00th_april_0000 i replied to their ' ticket ' again , explaining that none of my questions had been answere , asking them again and i also said that as a good will gesture on their part i was expecting the watch to be sent next_day delivery without extra_cost tome .
negative	00th_april_0000 , their reply was that the item wouldnot arrive with them until after the easter holiday and they would be sending my package with ' highest priority ' and that they had upgraded my postage to next_day delivery free of charge .
negative	00th_april_0000 my reply was again that thryhad not answered my questions and why were they showing itemsas instock when they clearly were not .
negative	i also asked for someone to call me on tuesday ( after easter ) as i was very dissatisfied and was getting no where by ' tickets ' 00th_april_0000 ' ticket ' reply_saying how sorry they were and a call back had been arranged for tuesday 00nd_april_0000 .
negative	yes you have guessed it tuesday came a d went without yhe promised call back .
negative	00rd_april_0000 i ticketed again saying that as they had not contacted me yesterday " i assume you will be conntacting me shortly within yhe next hour ".
negative	shortly 00_mins .
negative	later i received a call from them , at which point i was quite excited that i would get some ansaers as to why my watch was taking so long etc .
negative	etc .
negative	however after 00mins plus of asking the same questions in different_ways to try and get some i was still no further forward , apart_from them offering me an_alternative watch which was nothing like i had ordered ( and a mans watch ).
negative	00rd_april_0000 another ' ticket ' from [_name ], saying sorry again and it was a manufacturer problem and would i like an_alternative ( mans watch , nothing like 0 i had ordered ), basically just repeating all he told me on phone .
negative	00rd_april_0000 , i had given up and finally had enough so went online to cancel order , i searched , scrolled , droped down every box in every sequence , yes you have guessed it no way to cancel the order .
negative	so another ' ticket ' to [_name_] explaining my time spent and how did i canceland vet full_refund .
negative	guess_what no reply so sent another ' ticket ' later in the day asking for a reply to my earlier ticket .
negative	00rd_april_0000 , finally got a reply to say it had been passed to finance_dept .
negative	and they would refund 0 - 0_days but pleaze allow 00 days in busy_periods .
negative	they would email once refund made .
negative	i have been cnecking my bank_statement since and no refund , so today i phoned their sales line number , which would also seem to be customer service as [_name_] answered [_private data ] he said he couldn_'_t help so i asked to speak to the finance_dept .
negative	to get this zorted onceandfor all , he wouldn_'_t sorry , said he could not put me through , i then asked to speak to someone more senior and he said customer zervices were not available , i then asked him to get customer ssrvices to call me back and hesaid they didn_'_t make call_backs , b ut , as you can see from tuesday 00rd_april they do .
negative	[_name_] was particularly obstructive until i said that i would be contacting_trading_standards , he then agreed that i would get call back .
negative	i did phone trading_standards northern_ireland 00000000000 to seek advise .
negative	a ) write to nigel_o ' hara telling them the exact date you expect your refund repaid .
negative	b ) make_sure you print all ' ticket ' correspondence with them .
negative	c ) phone trading_standards as soon as they breach 00 days ( i . e .
negative	have not refunded within 00 days ) as 00 days is law and they can be prosecuted .
negative	finally after my call to trading_standards i checked my emails to find an_email from yes you have guessed it .
negative	nigel_o ' hara dontreply @ nigelohara ........ saying that my refund had been made and should be in my account within 00_hours , depending_on the banking system in place .
negative	i would also like to point out that i made quite a few calls via the sales line and always seemed to get the person / s that were replying to my ' tickets '
negative	i apologise now for spelling and gramatical errorsin this review , but my spell check has_gone wrong .
negative	and i haven_'_t worked out how to scroll up page onmy tab yet !
negative	!,
negative	my goods have not turned_up so not very happy
negative	i ordered the princess sofia dress for my daughter for christmas , i ordered this item over 00 days ago and had an_email the next_day to confirm my order and a dispatch_notice to say the item had gone out for dispatch .
negative	i haven_'_t yet received the item , however i received an_email asking me to rate the item , i then emailed back to say i hadn_'_t received it yet !
negative	i then received an_email to say it had been dispatched " a while ago " so i then phoned to enquire where it was , the girl i spoke to then said that they didn_'_t have any in stock and wouldn_'_t be getting any in until january !
negative	this would have been helpful to tell me that they didn_'_t have any in stock when they confirmed my order and took my payment .
negative	at_least i would have had time to look for an_alternative to be delivered before christmas !
negative	it begs the question had i not have rang to ask where the item was would i have been contacted otherwise ?
negative	?
negative	from_start to finish our experience was very poor .
negative	i had to find out about potential_tenants by phoning in to ask if there had been any inquiries .
negative	documents were not easy to create or access .
negative	systems failed on a daily_basis .
negative	i cancelled orders for deposit protection and rent collection due to lack of faith .
negative	there was no consistency or communication from the customer service team .
negative	we nearly lost our tenants who said that their experience with rentify felt like harassment .
negative	i would never use rentify again or recommend them in any way .
negative	took a day off work to meet my appointment for the engineers ...
negative	they failed to turn_up on appointment day and let_me know last_minute , so write to them on chat ... they refuse to speak to me about when they can install or cancel my contract .
negative	premium_rate number to ring on
negative	not acceptable at all
negative	i was very happy with the flowers they looked very cheap something i could have brought from the supermarket for £_00 .
negative	spent £_000 on six_nations tickets in november , confirmation that they had been posted on 00th_december - but tickets never received .
negative	despite the viagogo website confirming that all tickets are posted securely vis ups - this is not the case .
negative	viagogo confirmed to me that tickets were posted 0st_class with no proof of posting or tracking_number .
negative	i have three different resolution options from different staff , the last of which is ' just turn_up with your email and you will get in '!
negative	well , i phoned the organiser and they have no record of my booking and if i just turn_up - i won_'_t get in !
negative	i have also paid over_£_000 in flights to get to the event but viagogo have washed their hands of this saying it is the organisers problem .
negative	don_'_t quite know what to do next !
negative	i ordered a bouquet of flowers for my mothers 00st_birthday .
negative	they were supposed to be a surprise as we were unable to be her on her_birthday .
negative	when i rang her on her to wish her a happy birthday i asked whether she had got the flowers and she said ' without meaning to sound ungrateful , you could have brought a better bunch of flowers from the garage '.
negative	apparently they came in a nice box but the ' deluxe ' bouquet i had paid_extra for consisted of 0 carnations , 0 or 0 antirrhinums and 0 stems with white berries on .
negative	not what i consider to be a deluxe_bouquet ..
negative	in fairness , having made my disappointment apparent in the form of an e_- mail , they were quick to respond and i received a full_refund .
negative	agree with others who have had a bad_experience of this company .
negative	no reply to emails and phone always " engaged ".
negative	have requested refund of my money via my credit_card company who will attempt to retrieve it from de_cuisine ,
negative	who should really be investigated by the police .
negative	had a problem with tickets ordered on a journey from bath to london .
negative	my return tickets were not included with the rest that were posted to me , and so i was advised at the station to buy an entirely new set of tickets - and send the originals to the trainline for a refund .
negative	after some to -_ing and fro -_ing , i eventually got a partial_refund , less the booking_fee and a £_00 charge .
negative	i have requested a total refund as the mistake was clearly the trainline '_s - but their customer service is rude ( calling me a liar ), abrupt and at times hard to understand as their english is poor .
negative	i am not getting anywhere .
negative	a terrible , terrible service , and will not be using again .
negative	i received a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates from a friend .
negative	the flowers were just about acceptable although two stems were snapped , and the 0 roses only lasted two_days .
negative	the 000 g duc d ' o belgian luxury chocolates which were paid for as an extra were actually out of date when they arrived .
negative	i contacted the company and had to prove this by sending a photo , which i did .
negative	ten days ago they promised to send a replacement box of chocolates .
negative	they never arrived , so i chased up this week and today i received a 000g sloane square chocolates which had been wrapped in a piece of a0 paper and were smashed to pieces .
negative	so what i got was an inferior ( the company sloane square is located in lancashire and is a brand of the colonial gift company which is used by prestige ) and smaller box of chocolates now in pieces .
negative	i have been told that i have to send another photo and they will send out another box also wrapped in an a0 piece of paper because they do not have any wrapping for boxes of chocolates .
negative	this company is a farce - do not waste your money with them .
negative	sent two phones to sell on behalf of our small school
negative	tested phones donated by parents and after they worked fully charged them , posted to fonebank .
negative	then received an_email_saying they had to change one to non working - hence to say asked for phone to be returned as i know it was working and will not take less for it not very happy with the service .
negative	my experience using your variable direct_debit is rubbish ( i am being polite !
negative	), an item was returned and credited two_weeks before direct_debit was taken , i don_'_t think my bank should sort_out this issue .
negative	why can you not change the variable d / debit when you have enough notice to do so .
negative	on this issue i would not use your company again .
negative	when i sent an e_- mail it was not explained very well , i also rang and got the same response .
negative	i do not think my own bank needs to sort your problems out .!!
negative	!
negative	was at an ann_summers party as part of a hen_weekend near blackpool on 00th_may_0000 . the rep who turned_up was not the one that we had arranged , she was dirty and smelly and unprepared .
negative	00 of us placed orders in excess of £_000 and paid in cash on one order .
negative	each of us assumed someone_else had the paperwork , but it seems the rep ( debbie ) didn_'_t give anyone any paperwork .
negative	consequently the goods were not delivered as planned .
negative	ann_summers have not accepted any responsibility and have stopped_responding to our emails , they have stated that as the reps are classed_as self_employed they have no responsibility and it was our mistake to not get any paperwork .
negative	the police state its a civil case so can '_t do anything !
negative	i guess we should have realised how shady the rep was when she turned_up , she looked more suited to a dogging dvd or lay - by than a classy hen_party !
negative	buyers_beware !
negative	your service was terrible i ordered my flowers monday 0rd_march for them to be delivered wednesday 0th_march my flowers were not delivered today .
negative	i am not impressed and i will not be using this service again to be honest
negative	i have ordered from serenata on previous_occasions and have always been very pleased with the flowers delivered , but i am very disappointed with the ocean whisper that i ordered for my mother at a cost of £_00 . 00 they were a very poor bunch of flowers and although i do not expect them to look exactly like the description i do expect there to be some similarity .
negative	this is the second time i '_ve been unfortunate_enough to be on the receiving end of a tnt delivered parcel , and both_times have been equally as disappointing .
negative	each time they claim a they tried to deliver and i was not home - funny as i '_d taken time of work to wait for them - foolish i now know .
negative	calling the customer helpline is of no use whatsoever ; yes they are very kind and borderline helpful in that they can tell you your order will ( yet again ) be sent out the next_day , but i '_m afraid that '_s no good when the driver doesn_'_t bother to show then claims you weren_'_t home .
negative	if you ' re lucky_enough to actually receive your parcel , chances are it '_ll be in a sorry_state - everything i '_ve had from them i '_ve returned to sender , probably due to being loaded & unloaded multiple_times from the mystery delivery van ( s ) that operate through edinburgh city_centre .
negative	save_yourself the hassle and don_'_t bother - unless you want to wait 0 + days for a damaged parcel to appear .
negative	i '_m honestly at my wits_end with this company .
negative	i bought a new build apartment in june and the supplier was first_utility .
negative	i changed back to my original supplier therefore i was only with them a short while yet seem to be plagued by letters relating to an ' overdue ' ( estimated !)
negative	balance on my gas account .
negative	this balance is in fact false as i spoke to someone last night ( after finally getting trough ) who confirmed that they do have the correct meter_readings - to which i owe for 00 units of gas and not the 000_+ as per the estimate but couldn_'_t explain_why i '_m still being harassed by their credit control team .
negative	to top it off i came home today to find yet another letter from credit control threatening court proceedings !?!
negative	seriously !?!
negative	the best part is - i actually emailed the credit control team last_week about this , surprise_surprise that email was ignored too , yet they managed to send me another threatening letter just the other day ..... come on guys , sort yourselves out .
negative	let '_s be clear on one thing - i have no_issues in paying for what i owe , none whatsoever .
negative	i just want a correct bill without the constant harassment .
negative	i '_ve honestly had enough , time to see my solicitor i think .
negative	the only positive thing i have to say about this company is the staff ( when you get to speak to them ) are very polite and helpful , it seems to be more their system that '_s an utter disgrace .
negative	after having ordered and paid for 0 pieces of furniture , £_000 in total , we were told the delivery will take 0 to 00 days .
negative	all pieces were in stock .
negative	then at delivery date were were told that one chest of drawers will be delayed until next week .
negative	next week nothing happened and we waited another week before calling them .
negative	we were told it will be another week or we can chase_up the courier ourselves .
negative	we found it to be unacceptable and wrote an_email asking about delivery date and compensation for such a long delay ( it has_been a month ).
negative	no reply 0_days_later .
negative	i would never recommend this company to anyone and will not be buying from them in future .
negative	we still do not have what we paid for and nobody from the company seems to be bothered about it .
negative	i recently_sold an iphone_0gs to fonebank which was in perfect_condition .
negative	the price i would receive for this phone would have been £_00 .
negative	i waited for the payment however it didn_'_t arrive so i had to call them .
negative	once i managed to speak to a lady , she said payment had been delayed as the phone was damaged ( apparently the volume button fell_off ) which is totally incorrect .
negative	the phone was in perfect_condition and well_packaged .
negative	i asked the lady if they actually looked in the envelope or investigated if it was damaged by themselves but she said they don_'_t do that .
negative	basically , i ended_up loosing £_00 due to their negligence .
negative	my phone was worth more before they received it and now i '_ve lost out .
negative	i dread to think how many other people they have done this too !
negative	after waiting for over a week for my parcel to arrive from monsoon , i was given a tracking_number but hermes would not deal with me directly .
negative	back to monsoon on a premium number to be told ( eventually ) that my parcel had been left on top of the rubbish bins !
negative	00 / 00 for honesty though .
negative	these bins are communal bins at the bottom of the steps , that clearly the courrier didn_'_t fancy going up .
negative	needless to say , the parcel ended_up being collected with all the rubbish that week .
negative	i too have had atrocious service from hermes on selling something on ebay and i am_appalled that companies such as monsoon and next are using such a rogue company and shan '_t be shopping online without checking which couriers people are using first .
negative	why can '_t i leave 0_stars !
negative	my grandmother ordered a pair of step ladders in december , the cheque she posts is cashed straight_away , one month after purchase she_receives a letter stating the ladders are not available until the 0nd week on march .
negative	0nd week of march comes and goes ... no ladders .
negative	the phone number on the letter and the offer strip is no_longer in use so , not having access to a computer connection , she is unable to contact them and is obviously very upset and worried .
negative	after i google a new number and ring around 00 times , i get a delivery date for the following week .... low and behold they do not show .
negative	after another 0_weeks the ladders arrive .
negative	0_months late and guess_what ... they have pieces missing .
negative	' customer service ' were rude and unhelpful and my letter of complaint has_gone unanswered .
negative	diabolical all around .
negative	will never ever use again .
negative	tried to organise a treasure_hunt for a hen_weekend in manchester through them .
negative	paid the deposit which i was told would hold the booking and they could add or takeaway people on the booking , they set_up an account so everybody could log in and pay .
negative	this is a hen_party for 00 within 0_days most people had paid then i receive rude texts_telling_me it would be cancelled if all wasn_'_t paid over the weekend , then monday_morning a text almost like a threat to tell me that it would be cancelled by 00 if the money wasn_'_t there !
negative	not what you need on a hectic monday_morning at work !!
negative	so never_heard_anything ...
negative	i '_m under the impression all the girls have now paid , or as i had been informed by the agent it '_s not a problem to add or take people off the booking , i sent screen_shots of the messages to our whatsapp group which they all thought were very rude .
negative	( turns_out one of the girls wasn_'_t on the group ) anyway i called sarah ( the booking agent ) a week_later as i hadn_'_t heard_anything to be told ' i cancelled it babe ' there was just no need and they didn_'_t even email me , call me or text me or refund the money that had been paid !
negative	all they had to do was send a pack through the post it '_s a self managed
negative	treasure_hunt !
negative	anyway finally got a refund and booked exactly the same thing through another agent and much_cheaper !!
negative	crap customer service , overpriced !
negative	used a comparison web search to find a cheaper tarrif , npower came up cheapest .
negative	i emailed then phoned them t arrange to change over to them .
negative	was told it would be painless , that they would do all the work .
negative	all i had to do was tell my old supplier my meter_readings and then my supplier would be changed .
negative	this was back in october .
negative	we are now in april and although i left my old supplier 0th_december_0000 i still do not know my account number , i still don_'_t have a direct_debit set_up and have now got a bill which they still have not sent me and cannot tell me how much it is over the phone .
negative	i have phoned and been told that there was a problem which would be sorted soon , this was back in january .
negative	in march i phoned again when i noticed that no money had been taken out my account and was told that a complaint would have to be raised and this would be done immediately .
negative	they could see there was a problem with the account and it would be sorted .
negative	i then received an_email 0_weeks_ago confirming that someone would be in touch shortly and to assure me the problem would be sorted .
negative	still_waiting .
negative	emailed them 0_days ago telling them they had 0_days to sort it or i would be moving supplier .
negative	they cherish my custom so much the have not bothered to reply .
negative	do not touch them , they are rubbish .
negative	i now owe a bill i cannot_afford even_though i still don_'_t know how much it will be by the time they get the problem sorted .
negative	if i could i would give no stars for this .
negative	tried to pay off balance on card 0_weeks_ago and still trying while the interest just adds_up .
negative	spent a fortune on phone_calls to customer service , received a couple of emails_telling_me someone would phone me and almost a fortnight later still_waiting on the never coming phone_call .
negative	i eventually gave up again and phoned them in yet another failed attempt to pay off the card and after 00_mins i got transferred to someone " higher up " in customer service who offered to freeze the interest until the start of april when i would be able to pay off the card ( apparently you can only make 0 payments in any one month before their system won_'_t allow another payment on the account ), even_though my attempts to pay failed they still count as payments .
negative	she then asked me if i was happy with the outcome , which i was not as it did not sort the problem as i could still not pay off my card and no one from customer service had called me when they said they would , she then told me she could not freeze the interest and my complaint would be sent to another department .
negative	so barclay card was trying to buy me off for a few_pounds of interest .
negative	no way .
negative	i then received an_email 00 days ago saying someone would be in touch in 0_days , still no phone_call , email or letter .
negative	atrocious service .
negative	i tried on the 0nd_april to pay off card and once again was unsuccessful .
negative	dont understand_why i can '_t pay off the balance , i have enough money in my account , my details are up to date .
negative	i just want to get_rid of my card debt but barclay card are holding me to randsom by now allowing this and charging me more interest every day , then not phoning when they say they will .
negative	as soon as i can i will be cancelling this account .
negative	don_'_t touch barclay card , their customer service is rubbish .
negative	what is it with this review being taken down as it contravenes their review guidlines ?
negative	there is nothing in this review that is untrue and it is my opinion , there are no swear words or members of staff mentioned by name , i have not defamed anyone .
negative	it is a true account of my experience with this company .
negative	after looking through many of the reviews on here i see that a lot have been removed and mostly only excellent ones remain .
negative	what is that about ?
negative	i have changed my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
negative	was looking for an oak coffee_table and oak_nest of tables .
negative	after a little searchin online i discovered the perfect table and nest of tables with oakfurnitureland , i was delighted with the price as they were on sale .
negative	still a bit expensive but compared to other_websites i thought good value .
negative	that was until they arrived , the delivery driver would not wait_till i had checked them as he said he was a 0rd_party delivery and it would not matter if i rejected them as he would not take them back anyway .
negative	i signed reluctantly but put on it they were unchecked .
negative	i opened the box of the coffee_table and at frist look could see it was very poor quality .
negative	the slats that rang along the length of the table did not sit equally , the space between was different from one end to the other end , they were different_lengths .
negative	i immediate rang oakfurnitureland , who asked me to take several photos and send them to them , i received a phone_call a couple of days_later to say they would £_00 off the price of the table , allow me an exchange or return the table and get a refund .
negative	i opted for a refund and also a refund of the nest of tables ( which i had not even opened so disgusted with the quality of the coffee_table ).
negative	after discussion with a manager i finally got them to let_me return the nest for free as i had not just changed my mind about the purchase but the coffee and nest were bought for the one room and one without the other was pointless .
negative	the got them picked_up the next_day and a week_later still_waiting on the refund .
negative	i phoned 0_days ago to ask where my refund was and they had no knowledge of the items being picked_up even_though i had phoned them when the delivery driver left with the items .
negative	fingers_crossed they give me my refund very soon .
negative	should have left an update sooner , finally did receive a full_refund .
negative	but this would not change my mind about the company , would not recommend them or use them again .
negative	it would appear that heatandplum . com have finally gone out of business and the new company that have taken over have said they will not be responsible for any orders placed before 00nd_march and for customers to contact their credit_card company for refunds .
negative	absolutely_shocking the amount of time it has taken them to admit this and to still be taking orders and peoples money knowing they would / could not deliver .
negative	would not order from the new company if they paid me as can only_assume they knew what was going on and may even be still using the same staff .
negative	stay well clear unless you like to fling your money away , if that is the case i can furnish you with my address and you can send it to me .
negative	from telephoning all through the work the manager couldn_'_t be more attentive and polite .
negative	there problem was we had to return after only driving 0 miles down the road as the tracking was faulty .
negative	we were on our way to a day out at the seaside which was getting cut short by this .
negative	we were told on return that this sometimes happens but if this is the case why wasn_'_t this information given ?
negative	if this is indeed the truth company policy should be changed to stop the doubts in my mind that a very poor job had been done !
negative	will not use serenata again .
negative	ordered flowers for my sister who is ill . when they came lillies were brown .
negative	daisies were bent and snapped . looked like they , d been through an ordeal
negative	i ordered flowers for a friend for her_birthday .
negative	despite emails and text_messages from serenata_flowers advising me delivery had been made , my friend did not receive her gift .
negative	using yodel courier services is the worst thing this company could do , as this courier is the worst i have ever come_across for delivering .
negative	simple - i will not be using serenata again .
negative	i purchased a so called stuff crust pizza for my lunch ... was realy looking_forward to i ,... t baked for stated time looked ok , oh_yes looked nice ... omg have never tasted any thing so awfull in my entire life and thats the truth , i was exppecting nice stuff crust like the ones from the other supermarkets of pizza restaurant ..
negative	i dont_know what type of cheese it was if cheese at all the texture was more like lard with a yellow ting it had this awfull stuff for topping too so couln '_t just discard the crust , it really was awfull it went streight in thr bin , if i think about the taste and texture now it really makes me feel ill ....
negative	worst product i have ever had from icelands i wont purchase from there ever again .... for another pound could have got a really tasty pizza from morrisons , cheap isant always cheap ... is it
negative	this company advertises items that are not even in stock .
negative	i only found out that they did not have the item i paid for because i contacted them as my order was taking a long time to be processed .
negative	no one bothered to contact me and no one bothers to answer the phone .... ever !
negative	!
negative	if you want good customer service - don_'_t use this company .
negative	i had pre_- ordered a box set of prisoner cell block h and have been waiting for them to arrive i went into my local_store the other day to find them on the shelves .
negative	i got an_email from them today saying they were out of stock .
negative	i feel very let_down by the online service whats the point of having the pre ordering service if they don_'_t follow it through
negative	we needed a new shower ..
negative	looked at a number from various_sources including homebase as the store is not too far away and shopped there quite_often .
negative	there were a couple of suitable showers but none of these were in stock , which was frustrating as just wanted to drive to the store and buy a shower .
negative	selected the shower we wanted , and although not in stock the website confirmed could order and would be available for collection monday 0th_june .
negative	as it was saturday decided to go_ahead and order the shower , as collecting it on monday was ok .
negative	i ordered and paid for the shower and received confirmation could collect monday .
negative	on sunday i received a text_message to confirm would be available in store within 00_hours .
negative	i didn_'_t receive anything by early_afternoon , so as i work not too far away at went in store to see if it had arrived to collect .
negative	was advised , no , it hadn_'_t come in but they would check why .
negative	upon_calling the order team , was advised the shower was not being delivered that day , could offer no reason_why but was simply told may be the following_day , but wasn_'_t guaranteed !!!
negative	as my order clearly_stated would be available for collection on monday , i had arranged for it to be installed that evening .
negative	so i was left with no shower that i had paid £_00 . 00 for and no option for another as your store as such little stock there was no alternative available .
negative	i said i would have to cancel the order , so was passed_onto the online team .
negative	the person i spoke to ( unfortunately i didn_'_t get his name ) was so flippant i was quite shocked . he told me i would have to wait 0 - 0 working_days for a refund if i did want to cancel the order which i found unacceptable .
negative	i had ordered and paid for the shower on the basis it would be available , if this was not the case the order should not have been accepted and payment taken .
negative	to compound matters he could offer no reason_why it hadn_'_t been delivered in store , and told me i had 0 options ; cancel and wait up to a week for my money back , or drive nearly 00 miles to the market harbourough store as they did have one in stock !!!
negative	i handed the phone back .
negative	the member of staff who i dealt_with in store was steph jones , who was the only saving_grace in the whole matter .
negative	she agreed it was unacceptable , she had the written order confirmation confirming the collection date in her hand .
negative	she called the other store to confirm they did have a shower in stock , told them to hang onto it and she would arrange to get it to the leicester store , some way , by close of business .
negative	she did exactly that , and later that same evening sean , the store manager called to confirmed they now had my shower and i was able to collect it that night .
negative	unfortunately i still had to re arrange the installer as it was too late in the day to fit .
negative	i would not look to order anything_else online from homebase , an order should not be accepted and payment taken if you are not able to fulfil what is offered .
negative	if your website would have said the shower wouldn_'_t be available for the monday , i wouldn_'_t have ordered it !!
negative	it did and is wasn_'_t !!
negative	i would like to acknowledge steph jones for going out of her way to resolve this , but it should not have happened in the first place .
negative	very disappointed , not a good customer experience at all and you have lost a customer .
negative	i placed an order , within hours i was being emailed reminding_me to send the prescription , which had been sent .
negative	email after email arrived , threatening to cancel the order , which they did , while all the time they had received my £_00 vets prescription !
negative	had i not chased them and replaced the order my prescription would have been lost .
negative	this is the senpcind year this has happened , i wonder_if it '_s worth the few_pounds i save ordering it from them ?
negative	next year , i think i '_ll pay more but get it from the polite staff at the vets who speak to you rather_than fire out automated emails !
negative	i ordered 0 pair of pillowcases .
negative	they sent me different pillowcase to picture on their website .
negative	i asked to find out why items i received are different to picture and if i can get_hold of the product on the website .
negative	they said if i don_'_t want the product send them back .
negative	and ignored my following emails .
negative	bbq was 0 day late arriving due to an admin error and when finally being_able to open it discovered that the bbq had a wooden slag missing from the base .
negative	i tried_phoning over the weekend after delivery to resolve the problem but couldn_'_t get through so resorted to email which got through instantly and an_automated fault / replacement case was raised for the missing part with a following email_stating case approval and dispatch in a lead time ( which i now realise is 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	this part arrived a week after the bbq did , but it was the wrong part .
negative	instead of a wooden slat they sent a whole wooden base .
negative	once again unable to get through over the weekend i phoned first thing monday_morning when a lady assured me they would send out the correct piece as urgent and we would now have it by wednesday .
negative	today is now wednesday and lo and behold no part has arrived .
negative	00_mins of waiting on the phone i finally get through to parts and the man on the phone states no urgency is on the order it will be with us on friday 0_weeks since the bbq arrived .
negative	i tried to ask why there was no urgency and could be clarify it was definitely the right part which he couldn_'_t .
negative	i then asked to speak to a manager but they left at 0pm ...
negative	so i have given up disinterested customer service employees and incompetent back of house employees .
negative	i have now requested a refund but i have to wait for the bbq to be collected which will be anytime in the next 0 - 0 working_days ...... what a joke !
negative	had a faulty car from there took them 0_days to take the car in and fix but they did fix it eventually ... beware and always check the car your thinking of buying
negative	i sent in my iphone_0s 00gb with an estimated value price of £_000 .
negative	i then received a revised_offer from bozowi of £_000 with them stating : ' engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a significant scratches on the unit or screen that does not meet the minor wear and tear criteria .
negative	we therefore offer you the revised price below for your phone .'
negative	there were most definitely not ' significant scratches ' on the phone .
negative	but that '_s fine if they think that , so i rejected the offer to get the phone returned to me .
negative	this was on the 0th_february - 00 days ago .
negative	i have since received no communication from them , i have sent 0 emails - the most_recent stating if i do not receive some form of communication from them i will resort to taking further_action .
negative	i am unable to telephone them as their working hours are finished before mine are .
negative	and just to clarify , i check my junk email everyday as well - it hasn_'_t slipped into there either !
negative	would never recommend or use this company for their sheer lack of incompetence and poor customer service .
negative	so bozowi , if you are reading this - i hope this will prompt you to respond and finally return my phone , or revise my offer to the original price you offered .
negative	then maybe we can finally get this matter resolved without having to take it further :)
negative	--- update ---
negative	since writing this review i have been contacted by bozowi , who apparently have not received any of my emails due to a server issue .
negative	because of my unhappy review my phone has_been placed in quarantine until my complaint has_been resolved .
negative	i was asked to take this review down , however i have refused and said i will update my review accordingly .
negative	upon updating this review i will be receiving a revised phone price , and if i accept this will be paid into my bank_account the same day .
negative	this has_been a long_drawn_out process , however it looks like i will finally get a resolution , and i am finally happy with the outcome .
negative	for this reason i have changed my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
negative	as although they may have had issues with their emails , it should still be understood that the level of communication is considered to be unacceptable .
negative	-- further update --
negative	after a promise that my money would be with me the next_day after i had updated my review , i received nothing .
negative	the next_day i sent yet again another email to be told that they had been out of the office the previous day and hadn_'_t come in until late the day after that .
negative	why tell me that everything would be sorted the day after our phone_call then !?
negative	it is now sunday , almost 0 week after being told i would receive my money and still nothing .
negative	i am completely and utterly fed_up now and will be refusing to update this review again .
negative	this is an absolutely awful company , who lies and does not keep to promises and has no urgency whatsoever about them .
negative	i recently sent a different phone to <_external link_removed_> and received payment into my account 0_days_later , no_hassles .
negative	it has_been almost a month now .
negative	- further update -
negative	have since been contacted by a management member , the original member of staff dealing_with ( or not dealing_with ) my query quit , i was offered the full phone price and it was paid into my bank_account the next_day .
negative	thanks to <_private data_removed_> who finally_managed to help me in this ridiculous situation , i am now happy that this has all been resolved and i can forget about this horrible_experience !
negative	i recently booked a flight with bravofly from belfast to barcelona and broke up with my boyfriend so called up to change the name on the ticket .
negative	the woman on the other end of the phone took_ages to understand what i wanted to do because she clearly did not speak_english and she then preceeded tospell the name change incorrectly .
negative	when i tried to tell her this she simply ignored me or did not udnerstand me and told me i would get a confirmation_email soon .
negative	i waited on the email to prove she had spelt the name wrong but the email did not come .
negative	i called again and got the same person .
negative	she laughed at me and told me " jus to wait " and that i have " plenty of time ".
negative	what sort of customer service is that ?
negative	ryanair who everyone complain_about did the name change straight_away and nobody laughed at me .
negative	also they did add a lot of charges onto the original fee .
negative	never ever go with this company !
negative	they have absolutely no customer service !
negative	i know i love the shoes as have other pairs , but interlink failed to deliver and the other pair i ordered at the same time from a different supplier arrived two_days ago by royal_mail .... no problem .
negative	i have to wait in all day monday for yours .
negative	not good enough .
negative	use royal_mail .
negative	the flowers were delivered at 0 :_00pm
negative	they came in a box and they were ruined .. all burnt and brown !
negative	myself and a friend booked a spa day through this company .
negative	we got an_email 0_days before telling us they ' could not fulfil our request '.
negative	i called the hotel and they had us booked in for nearly a month later than agreed .
negative	called wahanda and was told ' your call is now next in the queue ' over and over again for over 00_mins before i was hung_up on .
negative	called again and stayed on hold for 00_mins before being told it was cancelled .
negative	never again .
negative	0 hours since i purchased my playstation live card and i still didn_'_t receive my code ... will never purchase from them again .
negative	00 days since my order has_been dispatched and i '_m still_waiting for it !
negative	i won_'_t recommend this site to anyone .
negative	service parfaitement honteux de_la part de_la maison dior .
negative	une fois ma_commande_passée , j ' ai_reçu une confirmation de celle - ci par email .
negative	quelques heures après , le statut de celle - ci était indiquée comme étant " en attente " sur_le site .
negative	j ' ai donc appelé le service consommateur afin de m ' éclaircir quant au statut de_ma_commande .
negative	j ' ai_eu affaire à une opératrice querelleuse et quelque peu impolie qui m ' a dit que ma_commande avait été bloquée par le service fia - net et qu_' un email de leur part aurait dû me parvenir afin de procéder à_des vérifications .
negative	hors fia - net ne m ' a jamais contacté .
negative	après trois appels de_ma part au service clientèle de dior , toujours en contact avec la même conseillère qui me traita telle une moins que rien et voyant que ma_commande ne l ' intéressait guère , j ' ai contacté moi - même fia - net qui m ' a gentiment et promptement répondu que ma_commande avait été certifié par leurs services ( et ce , je_le rappelle , sans aucune demande de vérifications de leur part ).
negative	résultat : ma_commande a été annulée pour rien sous prétexte que fia - net avait bloqué ma_commande ( ce_qui s ' est révélé être faux ).
negative	réponse à votre commentaire : pourquoi me notifier que votre service clientèle se tient à_ma disposition sachant que_la conseillère querelleuse avec qui j ' ai_été en contact lors_de_cette commande m ' a spécifiquement dit que_le service clientèle n ' avait rien_à voir avec_l ' e_- commerce dior ?
negative	le service clientèle n ' est apparemment qu_' un intermédiaire sans aucun pouvoir concernant le suivi des commandes et / ou des réclamations !

negative	i loved my lovefilm subcription before greedy amazon took over !
negative	i paid £ 0 . 00 a month and i got my lovefilm instant and my lovefilm by post .
negative	i didn_'_t even realise that anything would change when amazon took over as they told me nothing was changing but the name , what a load of bull .
negative	i had to email them several_times before they clearly told me that i would be expected to pay £_00 for amazon_prime for the year otherwise i couldn_'_t get instant video anymore .
negative	i don_'_t know about anyone_else but i don_'_t have that kind of money to just fork_out .
negative	absolutely ridiculous .
negative	don_'_t fix something that '_s not broken !!!

negative	order before 0pm and get delivery next_day , rubbish !!!!!
negative	i ordered at 00 :_00am the day before and we had to purchase the same again from elsewhere because of no show , no phonecal to explain_why l !!!!

negative	i ordered some shoes , nowhere on the website did it say they weren_'_t in stock .
negative	when i found out , i emailed to ask when they would be available and was told 0_weeks .
negative	i waited two_weeks , and then a day before they were due to be sent i got a message to say they were ' unavailable ' with no foreseeable delivery date .
negative	worst internet service i '_ve ever_experienced .
negative	had two of the three items ordered .
negative	haven_'_t had any update of missing item .
negative	not happy as i wanted to take on holiday .
negative	i ordered 0 x womanity perfume eco refills as gifts only to find that the perfume was yellow not pink as it should be .
negative	this was very embarrassing and i had to apologise to my friends and buy them another gift .
negative	i emailed thierry muglar who stated the perfume should be pink and any other colour must be a fake and i should only buy from their registered stockists .
negative	i have read a few reviews online were people have had the same problem and have stated this is due to o the perfume being old and off .
negative	i have emailed perfume_click . co . uk and am_currently_waiting for a response .
negative	i would not recommended this site to anyone .

negative	i ordered oral_b toothbrush_heads at £_00 . 00 from this company on may 0th and delivery was promised ain 0 - 0_days .
negative	the goods were shown as awaiting packing in hong_kong and after 0_weeks i emailed their customer_services 0 times but only got an_automated_reply , never a reply from an agent within 00_hours as they said .
negative	the telephone_number they gave on their email acknowledgement of my order is unobtainable .
negative	after 00 days i was able to get a refund through my credit_card company .
negative	then my goods were shown as dispatched but the parcel_force tracking_number was never recognised on parcel_force website - what a joke !!
negative	what a surprise when my toothbrush_heads arrived on june 00st , 00 days after_placing the order not the 0 - 0_days promised .
negative	this company does not deserve to be in business !
negative	!
negative	ordered some wedding day and evening_invitations , came and marriage was mispelt , a slight typo_error and apparantly they dont read what they are going to print !
negative	cause you think they would have noticed and done a nice thing by asking us are you sure this is what you want , if they had pointed_out the mistake ( which you think they would ) they could have said oops slight mistake and corrected for us .
negative	but they just printed and said its our fault and want to charge all over again , even when the evening_invites were not the colour we requested !
negative	when we contacted them by phone customer service were really unhelpful , and couldnt seem to make their minds up on whether they did read the proofs or not ?
negative	which you think they would to help people find mistakes like that ?
negative	honestly thought that would be part of the service regardless of if you typed them yourself , were not professionals and they are supposed to be ?
negative	i receieved my shower and called my plumber out to fit it , only to find i had the wrong one , i emailed bella bathroom to see if i could send it back to them - they said no , as i had recieved it 0_days ago , and that they only refund on goods that are received within 0_days !
negative	so i asked if they would exchange the shower , they said no and attatched the delivery note with a signature !
negative	the customer service with this company have no_intention of helping you !
negative	they have lost at_least one good customer :-(
negative	i bought 0 camping beds that sweated when i slept on them ending with them soaking_wet .
negative	retailer blamed firstly the weather then my sleeping_bag even_though told them it was fine on the air bed i bought .
negative	still_waiting for a response months after they said they would contact the manufacturer and despite chasing 0_weeks_ago !
negative	the hat i bought my husband for christmas had a rip in it .
negative	felt very let_down by superdry on christmas day !
negative	thought i was buying a premium product .
negative	this service took 0_weeks to issue a refund and have constantly been sending scratched and used games when i clearly asked for new .
negative	i purchased an item from this website around 0_months_ago and signed_up to their newsletter .
negative	after a couple of emails i decided to unsubsribe as i no_longer needed their services , but the emails kept coming .
negative	not only this but they were sending leaflets to my house , every one of them i returned to them asking for them to stop .
negative	i have sent two letters expressing my disappointment in their service , to which i have received no reply .
negative	very dissapointing with my first order . very poor quality of the print . i '_ll never use optimalprint again !
negative	bought a product online , after payment went through i was emailed a few_days_later to be told that there was a mistake and that the product was in fact out of stock .
negative	i was then refunded using the wrong method .
negative	left over a hundred passengers stranded in bologna ( or rather at forli - over an_hour away from bologna - with no access to taxis , buses or hotels available ).
negative	the airport ( a sad , ex - military outpost ) was going to close at midnight and leave everyone stranded .
negative	luckily a lovely local woman helped myself and three others ( including a vulnerable young female student with no money ) back to bologna .
negative	this was my first experience of ryanair - shocking !
negative	needless to say it was impossible to contact anyone at ryanair .
negative	travelling to bologna with ryanair is dangerous - go with easyjet or a regular airline .
negative	took a week to tell me my order was out of stock .
negative	i ordered the same thing in another size .
negative	it took them another week to tell me it was out of stock .
negative	over a fortnight between placing an order and receiving any goods .
negative	useless person on the phone wouldn_'_t speed up my order or provide any confirmation that they had the item in stock .
negative	one of the most useless internet based companies i '_ve ever_encountered .
negative	i shop online a lot and this lot stand_out as hopeless .
negative	i complained online to their customer_services dept ( no response ).
negative	only use this company if you ' re desperate ...
negative	i ordered some merrell sandals on 0st april - the website said 0 day delivery .
negative	on 0th_april i got an_email to say that shoes would only be in stock on 00th_april .
negative	then i heard_nothing .
negative	i contacted them on 00th_april and the reply said that the sandals were not availble and they were ' wondering ' if i would like to change my order or get a refund .
negative	when were they going to let_me know this , if i hadn_'_t contacted them ?
negative	surely they should keep the customer informed ?
negative	i will not be ordering from them again .
negative	my item arrived faulty and was not refunded .
negative	there were holes in the dresses , it was creased and dirty and i was offered a 00_%_discount as compensation .
negative	awful customer service .
negative	poor communication_skills .
negative	ruined my sister '_s hen_do .
negative	i do not rate them at all .
negative	they are out to rip people off and i hope they are out of business shortly .
negative	if they were an honest company on the final page on their website it would remind one that custom duties will have to be met .
negative	they cannot even be bother to reply to one '_s emails .
negative	like others have said :
negative	don_'_t touch them with a barg pole !!!
negative	!
negative	my tickets hadn_'_t arrived until 0_days before the event , its very worrying to feel that your tickets wont arrive at all .
negative	so lack of organisation and they should have chased things up themselves rather_than waiting for me to complain and then chase_up afterwards ... the tickets on the market price were indeed over priced by £_000 when it should have been £_00 or included within the extra admin costs that were added on top ...
negative	i was told that if my tickets didnt arrive then i should get a refund ??!
negative	whats the whole point in building up your experience something and then get a refund ... unacceptable .
negative	fantastic venue at the royal_albert_hall , but poor customer service who mentioned that there weren_'_t no guarantee if something should go_wrong ... it just shows that they only care about themselves and not the consumer !
negative	sadly i wont_be using viagogo again ... very disappointed .
negative	i have used partyrama before and had no_problems ; however this time was a totally different_story .
negative	i received a call on my phone from a number i did not recognise .
negative	on answering the call i was informed by a gentleman that he had been delivered my deliver .
negative	the box had been addressed to him however my invoice and items that i had ordered were inside the box .
negative	the gentleman_who received the box had my invoice details which include my contact number , payment details and home address .
negative	i am luck that the gentleman was honest enough to call me and explain the situation .
negative	upon_calling partyrama '_s customer service , although the customer advisor was helpful , she did not apologise for the mistake once .
negative	this all happened on 0th_may and i am still_waiting for the items to be delivered .
negative	since 0th_may i have had no communication from partyrama and we are now on 00th_may .
negative	i accept mistakes_happen , however i believe the situation has_been dealt_with appallingly .
negative	the parcel should have been collected on tuesday , it was not .
negative	rang interparcel on wednesday_morning to tell them , they said they would email yodel as there was no phone number for them .
negative	i checked the internet and was able to find a number for yodel .
negative	i rang them myself and they said they had not been contacted by interparcel but would look into the issue .
negative	after a number of calls from yodel they suggested that if interparcel rang the depot it may help speed up the process .
negative	i rang interparcel back & they refused to ring yodel .
negative	we waited_until thursday_afternoon before one final call to interparcel .
negative	all they said was there was no contact from yodel ( who were waiting for a call from interparcel ) but refused to ring them .
negative	in all of the phone contact with interparcel not once did i get the impression that the person i was talking to was even the slightest bit bothered .
negative	in the end we got a refund and got the parcel delivered cheaper with hermes .
negative	i have used interparcel for years without_any_problems but this has_taught me a lesson , that is something does go_wrong they don_'_t care & will put no effort into resolving the problem .
negative	i will never use their service again .
negative	i booked 0 nights in " escape hostel " in lagos , and they cancelled my reservation cause they had an inspection and they had to close the hostel .
negative	they charged the full_amount of the reservation , i '_m trying to get my money back but i have no answer .
negative	i wouldn_'_t book through this website again , cause i think they don_'_t have reliable hostel to book .
negative	ordered 00 / 00 / 00 money taken 00 / 00 / 00 no goods received .
negative	can not reach them by e : mail , get no response on live_chat .
negative	there phone number is turned on and off and charged at premium_rate so don_'_t call them as they make money from this too .
negative	have spoken with amazon to get them to remove them from their site and to advise that the review rating is inaccurate .
negative	i am contacting watchdog and trading_standards .
negative	and will pursue this to the end .
negative	it '_s not the money it '_s the principle !!
negative	!
negative	disgraceful , uncaring set of people .
negative	my disabled aunt and i bought a used car off them in march which was faulty .
negative	its been back to the garage four times and each time they have failed to repair it .
negative	ive asked for my money back and despite been told they would refund me theyre now refusing .
negative	i '_m now told the onus is on me to prove that the cars faulty .
negative	i wouldn_'_t mind but i paid 0 grand for it could have been well on my way to a new one with that .
negative	its only been on the road a grand_total of 0_weeks since purchase and im now using public_transport .
negative	the sale of goods_act isnt worth the paper its written on and trading_standards have been unhelpful .
negative	will never deal with this company again and will encourage all those i know to do the same .
negative	shame on you stoneacre .
negative	( i know there are a lot of positive_reviews on here but wouldn_'_t you think they would want to resolve customer complaints without animosity in order to encourage repeat_custom ?)
negative	ordered camera kit on saturday 00th .
negative	because of the time difference , i knew it wouldn_'_t be posted until monday 00th_september when i duly received the shipping confirmation and tracking_number .
negative	however , it wasn_'_t actually collected from digitalrev until wednesday 0nd_october , according to their livechat the tuesday was a public holiday .
negative	why didn_'_t you tell me that in the shipping confirmation and why did you tell me it had shipped when it hadn_'_t ?
negative	most people would agree that a parcel has shipped only when it '_s been collected by or dropped_off with the courier .
negative	the estimated delivery date was friday 0th_october , which is today .
negative	as far as i can see from the tracking , the camera is currently touring hong_kong , i assume taking some fantastic pictures as it goes .
negative	i emailed tnt today and they very quickly apologised and stated there had been a delay in hong_kong but apparently it '_s on - route to the uk .
negative	although the tracking shows it '_s still in hong_kong .
negative	when ( if ) it arrives in the uk it still needs to clear customs and i have a feeling that '_ll be a problem too .
negative	ordered a camera bag and book from amazon on wednesday 0nd_october , estimated delivery monday 0th_october and they arrived today , friday 0th_october .
negative	excellent service from amazon , but useless at the moment as i have no camera .
negative	will i buy from digitalrev again ?
negative	that '_ll be a no .
negative	i don_'_t care about the saving , it '_s just not worth the hassle .
negative	and the next lens i want is cheaper in the uk anyway !
negative	very dissappointing
negative	i ordered 0 cake_tins to make a wedding_cake .
negative	payment was taken immediately , but did not even receive a confirmation e_- mail of the order .
negative	no sign of them appearing and am giving up hope .
negative	hope noone ever uses this terrible company and that all these bad_reviews mean less people are cheated out of their hard - earned_cash .
negative	flowers delivered to wrong_address , dumped over the gate and no effort made by carrier to verify correct recipient .
negative	avoid
negative	i ordered my product on the 00th_august and i am still_waiting delivery i havnt even received an_email_confirming dispatch last time i order from this company .
negative	would rather pay more and receive my product .
negative	first order from web_site .
negative	purchased ink nido biker_jacket size 00 which was available on the site .
negative	order was confirmed and money taken out of my account .
negative	received e_mail 0_days latter saying jacket was not available due to stock problems .
negative	my money was refunded quickly hence the reason for 0_star .
negative	jacket is still showing available on web_site 00 days_later .
negative	a nice_gesture would have been the offer of sirius jacket in ink , which is available in size 00 for the same price to avoid_disappointment .
negative	hence i shall be buying my jackets from elsewhere .
negative	the service i received in store was second to none .
negative	however , when i telephoned the store on 00th_april_0000 regarding the strong_smell from the wardrobe i was informed that it would go in time and to leave the doors open - not very satisfactory as i had left the doors open since it was delivered at the end of march_0000 .
negative	i telephopne customer_services on 00th_may_0000 to again complain_about the smell but to date nothing has_been done and the wardrobe is still smelling .
negative	would i recommend furniture_village - no i would not .
negative	i ordered on the 0st february
negative	on the 00 feb they told me my order would be dispatched that day and i would receive it next_day – i did not
negative	on the 00th i was told by the call_handler he had personally dispatched it and would get back to me – he did not
negative	on the 00th they tell me you can not track it and the goods are not in stock – someone is telling fibs somewhere
negative	meanwhile i am sat in my dark kitchen
negative	wouldn_'_t help us with a claim we had against a seller .
negative	after_spending all morning decorating the tree for my disabled daughter 0 hours after turning lights on half had stopped_working the only_reason they was not sent back was because my daughter would have been extremely upset never use this company again
negative	i ordered a toilet online from this company .
negative	the toilet_seat was scratched upon unpacking the item but my plumber obviously fitted the toilet anyway rather_than leave us without a toilet .
negative	i contacted them straight_away to tell them and they asked me to send a photograph which i did .
negative	as i didn_'_t get a reply , i sent a couple more emails over the next week to chase_up an outcome .
negative	no reply whatsoever so rang them up to be told that as the toilet was fitted and the technical_team didn_'_t deem the scratch to be a defect , they would not replace the seat .
negative	the girl i spoke to implied that it had been damaged upon fitting .
negative	the fittings on the toilet_seat are cheap plastic and wobble so i can '_t see it lasting long anyway .
negative	you get what you pay for .
negative	i won_'_t be using this company again .
negative	i am still_awaiting delivery of a bathroom furniture product i ordered online on the 00th_february .
negative	i did not receive an_email to confirm my order but luckily i had printed out my confirmation .
negative	i sent an_email to say i had not received an_email and did not get a reply so i sent another email after 00_hours ( which is the promised time for a response to an_email ).
negative	during this time on the 0th_march i managed to get through to customer_services by phone who said my order number didn_'_t exist .
negative	they did however find me on the system and told me my order would be coming in by the end of that week .
negative	i have tried many_times since to reach customer_services by phone but after 00_minutes usually give up .
negative	i have today managed to contact someone_who said that they are probably waiting for stock .
negative	the lady i spoke to told me she would contact the buyer and find out when i could expect my order .
negative	when asked if that would be today , she told me ' probably not because i '_m going home soon '.
negative	i asked what my order number was and was given a different number to the one i was given upon ordering .
negative	when asked why this was she told me that the order number changes .
negative	it isn_'_t surprising i can '_t track my order online if this is the case .
negative	not once have i received an_apology for the total_lack of communication , unprofessionalism or inconvenience homebase is causing me .
negative	i am_appalled by the poor customer service i have received and will never use them again .
negative	if my item ever turns_up it will be a miracle .
negative	totally_unacceptable .
negative	bad business avoid ..
negative	waited in today for the pick_up of a faulty bike , to find out they hadn_'_t even booked me in .
negative	got to wait in again tomorrow !!
negative	wheres my wages going to come from !!
negative	also been told i wouldn_'_t receive another bike until the end of next week , its only monday now .. but yet the original bike was sent next_day delivery ...
negative	so they send out a faulty item and we have to pay the consequences .. to make_matters worse they didn_'_t care less it was my sons_birthday_present .. what theyre trying to do is fix the faulty imported bike and send it me back ..
negative	suppose ill have to wait for refund , should imagine they are going to try make me wait for that too .. at_least i can go get a new one from a reputable_company this time ..
negative	lesson_learned if there is no shop to an online business avoid !!
negative	time .. wasters with no compassion !
negative	!
negative	i have recently brought toilet_seat which came with out any instructions .
negative	when i contacted customer service they said it does not come with instructions and i should contact a plummer .
negative	i have assembled many things in my life with instructions and i feel this should have some simply instructions can anyone helps it auto and holland seat sea000 .
negative	i have fitted the deluxe 000 anti_scratch soft_close with no problem as it had instructions .
negative	when i ordered i ask the woman if the fitting where the same and she said yes and they are not .
negative	help
negative	ich_bin über einen groupon deal auf diese seite gekommen .
negative	wollte mir eine skibrille kaufen .
negative	habe 0 zur auswahl bestellt .
negative	die erste habe_ich nach 0 wochen bekommen , eine ist nicht mehr auf lager obwohl sie im onlineshop als vorrätig aufgelistet war und_die anderen zwei sind nicht mehr auf lager und werden irgendwann geschickt .
negative	wenn der gutschein nicht verfallen würde , hätte ich meine bestellung schon längst wieder zurück gezogen !!
negative	!
negative	ordered four items of furniture .
negative	delivery for all 0 confirmed and therefore the day before we cleared out old furniture .
negative	on morning i got a call advising 0 item could not be delivered as it was out of stock & would not be restocked .
negative	i was very annoyed as i should have been informed 0_weeks before not on delivery day !
negative	we had disposed of our old desk because delivery had been confirmed .
negative	then i was told i would not receive my refund for a while as it had to be sanctioned .
negative	i did not receive a response to my email complaining re the above so therefore i cannot recommend this company .
negative	had used them previously without problem and was happy with items & service but due to recent bad customer service and lack of response would not use again .
negative	placed order on 00th_june for dog flap .
negative	it is now 00rd and nothing :-( if it is not here by tomorrow the 00th_june i shall go back to using amazon their goods arrive within 0 / 0_days .
negative	i will not be using viovet anymore .
negative	whilst jet0 themselves offer an excellent , friendly , reasonably_priced service and much improved leg_room in the new cabins they need to be careful which car_hire_companies they align themselves with .
negative	we booked online and it is only afterwards that it is revealed who the hire company will be .
negative	we were allocated gold car at faro .
negative	when we got there we were presented with two options : either pay the damage_waiver fee of around 000e for a week and drop and leave your car without inspection on return or have 0000e charge placed on your credit_card with a full vehicle inspection on return and where any damage is found the whole amount would be retained - this is extortion at its worst .
negative	a young family and an elderly couple in front of us were both forced to pay the waiver fee as they did not have enough credit on their credit_cards - how is this an option ?
negative	it is in fact extortion !
negative	jet0 needs to look at this very carefully and cease using gold car and any other provider who acts in this despicable manner .
negative	it does not reflect well on you !
negative	a very expensive calendar .
negative	no matter_how much i tried i could to load a picture into the january slot .
negative	the month and day part of the calendar are tiny , and practically_impossible to see at any distance and you are not able to make any notes or appointments .
negative	on a positive_note the pictures themselves are good .
negative	but the item is totally_useless as a calendar , and for 00 " 00 i am extremely disappointed .
negative	if i could give zero_stars i would .
negative	i very very rarely have anything to complain_about but have to warn_people before using approved , i started off as an_avid fan , filling my cupboards for incredibly low costs .
negative	the delivery charge is actually quite reasonable when you realise how much you can get and the choice and quality was very good .
negative	however and this is the bit people should be careful of ..... i made my third order a few_days ago and looked forward to the swift delivery , when it arrived , i discovered a very badly packed , well should i say not packaged at all , bottle of bubble bath had leaked over a large_quantity of of my items .
negative	when i contacted them , initially waited along time for a response but after messaging on fb , a gentlemen got back to me saying they were under staffed .
negative	he promised to refund me due to having to clean everything and the bottle being damaged .
negative	i had this in writing and photographs of the incident .
negative	however a day later i was then informed that they were no_longer doing this and had to review my photos with the manager , they refused to refund unless they took all the items back and then decided if to refund .
negative	so because of there mistake i would end up with no shopping and a possible refund in over a weeks time , if they decided ????
negative	this is crazy .
negative	after numerous_emails etc , i have given up .
negative	they are obviously very under staffed and have a poor or should i say non_existent return_policy .
negative	:-( now they just wont contact me back and have ignored my messages .
negative	the customer service centre is run from india who i can '_t understand , the gimmick is you can order up to 0pm the day before but they never have delivered it the next_day , i normally have to chase it up .
negative	i may be unlucky but we have the most unsociable , ruse , tactless milkman ever who should definitely not be working with the public .
negative	a disgusting ' service ', even the £_00 off won_'_t make me return ( unless they sort their staff out ).
negative	i have placed many orders with this company and while despatch is often very slow and they advertise items they have no stock of , i have always lived with this but now they have gone too far .
negative	i ordered a calendar , they sent it to me in a box that was over 0 inches too short so they just shoved it in and the cardboard ripped and creased meaning i was unable to give it as a gift as intended .
negative	to cut a very long_story_short , i sent photos , returned the item and sent 00 + emails to there awful ' customer_services ' before they would refund the £ 0 . 00 .
negative	yes £ 0 . 00 .
negative	they have now lost a regular customer , i could not trust them with future more_expensive orders .
negative	i have sent over 00 emails to there ' customer service ' department as i should of received my gift in february and i keep being told its been sent or it will be sent but every time i ask for a confirmation it has_been sent i get fobbed_off and now 00st_june ( 0 0 / 0_months later ) i receive an_email to say they have had problems sourcing gift and it will be sent today .
negative	this is really not good enough and who_knows if they are telling the truth this time or if i will have to wait another 0 0 / 0_months .
negative	what is wrong with honesty if they didn_'_t have the gift 0 0 / 0_months_ago say that and then keep the customer informed on when the gift will be received that would of been fine but lying to customers is just wrong and i do not feel you even deserve the 0_star_rating .
negative	beware
negative	i am very very disappointed in the 00 deluxe rose they were going black round the edge of the roses and some of the steam were broking i want my money back or a replacement send i '_m so disappointed they were order as a surprise and dead flower was discussing what are you going to do about this
negative	we signed a years contract with phs after_comparing_prices for different suppliers .
negative	we were given an example invoice of are likely costs , however within the first month we were soon being charged unexpected costs .
negative	i tried to phone but was repeatedly left on hold .
negative	i tried writing and got one charge credited .
negative	the bins were in poor condition , however the final_straw was when we saw the drivers mix_up both recycling bins and waste bins together .
negative	i wrote to cancel our contract , i believed that they had not delivered the service they had promised and therefore the contract was null and void .
negative	i emailed , faxed and phoned but no response other than you can '_t cancel the contract .
negative	we ignored everything as i felt i had used up enough time dealing_with an incompetent company .
negative	we kept receiving invoices , direct_debit instructions and then finally started receiving notice that they were stopping our service which we had not used for months .
negative	eventually they came and collected their bins .
negative	they made no effort to collect outstanding debts until we were passed_onto a debt_recovery agency which surprise_surprise is owned by phs .
negative	i had the impression they are not at all interested in resolving an issue .
negative	i eventually agreed to pay £_000 to settle an amount outstanding which they thought was £_000 .
negative	i would not recommend this company at all .
negative	i love ann_summers products and we have spent alot with them over the years but i wont_be shopping with them again , the customer service is getting worse and the returns process is just too long !
negative	i purchased an item in october and decided to wear to for the first time on new years_eve , it was a lovely slip which made everything look fantastic - well for 0 hours til the strap snapped and i had to return home to change !
negative	i returned the item on jan 0th , after emailing them since the 0st jan and finally getting a reply on the 0th asking me to send it in to them .
negative	its now jan 00th and i still have no refund !
negative	it was apparently processed on the 00th but im yet to see it !
negative	i returned another item on the 00th and thats not even been processed yet !
negative	ann_summers is great if you get a good product that fits well and doesnt break but the chances are it will be too small or poor quality and then you ` ll have to fight to get your money back !
negative	not good ann_summers !!
negative	ill be shopping elsewhere from now on - its time you realised theres alot of competition out there now and you need to step up your game !!!
negative	!
negative	if you need something sorting the details on here seem to be the best option , email sent - immediate_reply !
negative	fingers_crossed this will go somewhere now !
negative	i almost forgot i ordered this its been over two_weeks and i still_haven_'_t received my order ... it was my first time ordering from bulk_powders as referred to me by a friend but as i '_m still getting through the last of my current protein .
negative	so it hadn_'_t crossed my mind until now ... how much longer will it take ?
negative	i was told 0 - 0 working_days ?
negative	but it has_been much more than that now !
negative	good quality products but if anything_goes_wrong with your order then i personally found the person_who dealt_with me to be disrespectful and suffering a god complex .
negative	this lady was unprofessional , vindictive and i would have thought with the amount of time i complained that her manager would have pulled her up on what was happening and at_least spoken to me once .
negative	things got so bad that this lady sent me expired vitamins , as member of she i was shocked that the company she rep had not contacted me after my complaint and this serious breach in health and safety .
negative	the person in question has seriously damaged the company '_s reputation in my eyes .
negative	be very careful when u place order .
negative	i am quite disappointed with thw delivery timea from this company compared to other online geoups !
negative	gap is a good example , they deliver within 0_days , free of xharge over_£_00 !
negative	please let_me know when ro expext my order !
negative	awful , awful , awful .
negative	please_avoid the shopping_cart product like the plague if you are a uk_based business looking to sell products online .
negative	everything is very us focused - but that '_s not make clear until you actually get down to trying to set things up .
negative	click the link to set_up a menrchant account to accept credit_cards and you get taken to a form that only applies to us customers !
negative	a merchant account costs £_00 plus_vat for us customers but £_000 plus_vat for uk customers .
negative	the help pages are not linked to the " action pages " so you can look up how to do something but then have to spend_ages hunting down where to do it .
negative	i '_ve had to resort to using google to find whay i am looking for on godaddy .
negative	the site navigation and layout if beyond bad .
negative	customer service is totally usless if things go_wrong - the worst i '_ve ever_encountered - they just don_'_t give a monkeys .
negative	i get partial answers to questions .
negative	i wish i '_d gone somewhere_else as i am now going to have to move my business elsewhere to a company that actually serves uk customers !
negative	i am still_waiting for my product after 0_days
negative	terrible service
negative	i placed an order for perfume in april and still have not received either goods or a refund .
negative	i have sent several e_mails and been asked to 0 ) wait another weekand0 ) wait for the result of their claim for non delivered goods .
negative	i believe that the company who took my money have an obligation to supply the goods that they advertise or refund my money if the order is not fulfilled .
negative	i ordered my goods and payment was taken immediately .
negative	00 days_later i am still_waiting for my goods .
negative	not good when other_companies offer free postageand goods arrive within 0_days .
negative	can '_t even contact company until after 00 days have elapsed !
negative	will not use again .
negative	i was treated to a mushroom kit as a present .
negative	i spent a lot of time and trouble looking after them .
negative	i had about 0 or 0 brown mushrooms and no more .
negative	not worth the £_00 they cost or the postage money .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	am i entitled to a refund ?

negative	i ordered a tyre online to be fitted on thursday 00th_july between 0000 - 0000hrs .
negative	i received a confirmation_email_stating the driver would call to give a more exact time on the day which i thought would be great .
negative	well i waited in all afternoon on my day off and finally received a call at 00 . 00 advising that the driver had a had a day from hell and the earliest he could get to me would be 0pm ?
negative	?
negative	i '_m a shift_worker and thought a mobile tyre_fitting service would be ideal but how wrong could i be .
negative	the driver told me he would get the call_centre to call me back to re - arrange another appointment .
negative	after 00_minutes i hadn_'_t received a callback so i made the call myself .
negative	i explained my situation and was told that they couldn_'_t fit me in til monday as they were too busy over the weekend .
negative	i advised that this was unacceptable and requested a full_refund and was given a response of " sorry , what else can i say ".
negative	an absolutely shambolic service and complete_lack of customer service - i will not be recommending this company to anyone .
negative	i ordered an in car cradle that was advertised as having a charger included and aled display to show blackberry was charging .
negative	received cradle in post but it does not come with charger and no installation insructions just cheap bits of plastic .
negative	cannot make contact on phone keep getting told to call back later by automated_voice .
negative	no response to e_- mail to customer_care dept .
negative	wil be contacting_trading_standards as i feel i have been defrauded .
negative	when you are asked to classify if it is working or non working and the phone switches on and can still be used then it is classed_as working .
negative	a non working phone would not be able to be turned on or used .
negative	if you want the phone to be put down as having a fault then add that to the drop down box !
negative	i cannot_believe that it is not on the options and i think that it is a waste of time !
negative	order made 00 december for a christmas_present .
negative	i chased when no news that week and was told then the order was not available .
negative	i asked to cancel .
negative	00 dec i was told by e_mail item was in stock and would be sent by courier , not standard delivery , that week .
negative	00 dec e_mail received in the evening saying item not available - did i want an_alternative ?
negative	i phoned and was told it would be sent next_day delivery , by then monday 00 dec .
negative	waited in all day and of course nothing arrived and phones not answered .
negative	chased on 00 december and recorded_message says closed until 0nd_january .
negative	i don_'_t advise anyone to use this company
negative	i '_ve had to ring virgin more times than i ring my closest friends the last_year .
negative	we have tivo - which is fine , it '_s never been good , but it works - and superfast fibre_optic broadband .
negative	in theory .
negative	what we actually have is overpriced sproradic internet_connection .
negative	i have to ring virgin frequently about the poor internet and more recently , about their billing .
negative	they have started to overcharge us by £_00 a month .
negative	on the phone they pass me to different people every few_minutes , none of whom understand the situtation so i have to explain each time .
negative	every time i call i '_m told something different .
negative	they refused to refund me the money they overcharged me unless we sign up to another 00 month_contract .
negative	sound appealing ?
negative	another 00 months of pulling my hair out ?
negative	no thanks virgin .
negative	they told me i '_d have to submit a complaint and request transcripts of my previous calls to be considered for a refund .
negative	i did this a month_ago .
negative	then i did it again .
negative	i have heard_nothing and i '_m at my wits_end .
negative	go with any other company , any other company in the world .
negative	do not sign up to virgin broadband if you value your sanity !!
negative	!
negative	the delivery people were very efficient and polite .
negative	the flowers i had delivered to my mother in law for her_birthday were awful .
negative	the leaves were limp and dying , the flowers were limp dying or unopened , it is now 0_days since the flowers were delivered and the unopened buds have just shrivelled and died , especially the sunflowers .
negative	other relatives had flowers delivered to my mother in law from different florists , interflora and christines florists and the flowers from those distributors are blooming lovey !
negative	in short if u want to waste money on limp disappointing flowers buy them from clare_florist .
negative	on the primark website you cant really see there range of clothes .
negative	which i think is useless .
negative	what if people wanna do their shopping online and they want to use primark ?
negative	they need to step it up !
negative	!
negative	this is the second booking i have made through aferry .
negative	unfortunately booked it in the morning and realised by the afternoon my trip plans had changed and i had to cancel the entire booking .
negative	i was charged_£_00 cancellation costs , even_though it was weeks before the booking .
negative	this was absolutely outrageous as a cancellation charge .
negative	i would never use this company again and will point out to everyone i meet in italy / sicily not to use this company .
negative	dreadful .
negative	ordered tyres in nov in stock promised dec for 00 + 00 dec no tyres
negative	sent promised refund immediately - no refund until jan .
negative	i get a sense that these individuals are very god at the sales_pitch and making money off people at the start but less good at after - care and facing up to responsibilities when things go_wrong .

negative	i used this website on recommendation of a friend and at first had no_problems .
negative	then in february a delivery arrived with damaged cans of dog_food which_resulted_in the food having gone rotten .
negative	i emailed requesting a refund of the two cans and after a month emailed again .
negative	my last email sent a week_ago ( and still with no response ) was not only a complaint about the delivery but also about the appalling service .
negative	after_spending almost £_000 over the past 0_months i '_m moving onto a different supplier !
negative	i have received nothing yet despite phoning a week after my original order .
negative	very discappointing .
negative	have purchased twice_now from this site first time it was ultra violet and it was ok , second purchase escada for a birthday_present very disappointed not like shop bought its as if its watered_down wouldnt recommend and wont use site again .
negative	my wife had to take a sudden flight to ireland for a family emergency and we inadvertantly booked for july and not june , but the driver took the car ok .
negative	i emailed [_name_] in customer service (!!!)
negative	to make_sure there would be no_problems on her return and was assured the car would be there no_problems .. full stop no mention of any surcharges in the mail or on the web terms and conditions and booking confirmation
negative	on her return from a funeral earlier that morning she was told that she would have to pay £_00 in cash to get the car back , and was made in her distressed state to go to a cash point to get the moeny , when all she wanted to do weas to get home to the confort of her family asap .
negative	to date i have sent two email with no reply , so you can work out what sort of company they are .
negative	as a side note i emaild the ceo of baa who got someone to reply back straight_away and have launched an investigation_into their cash fo car practices .
negative	i went to the clinic , the woman was 00_minutes late i did not find this out until arrived , i could not have a drink while i was waiting as they had ran_out of milk , the treatment was not as expected , i was asked if i had any make up on then the gel was put on my skin for a minute then washed off with cold_water and sun screen was applied , the whole_thing lasted about 0 minutes and did not have the cleanse to start with as i thought and expected a peel not gel that just burnt my skin it was quite painful , i think it was a waste of time and money and was very disappointed .
negative	i purchased a product on 00 / 00 /_0000 and to this date ( 0 / 00 / 00 ) have still not received my product .
negative	i contacted beautybay and they informed that i needed to contact my national post service however as i was not provided with a tracking_number the national post service could not do anything about it .
negative	i contacted customer service several more times for more information about how i can track my order yet have had no feedback whatsoever .
negative	i am disappointed with the service of beautybay
negative	cannot say how good or bad the product is that i purchased , as i have not opened it yet .
negative	what i can say is that the box arrived damaged , so i only hope it is ok .
negative	other products received from festive_lights have always been in presdene condition .
negative	i ordered my sister some cologne from cheapsmells for christmas on december 0 , 0000 and i still have not received it as of december 00 , 0000 .
negative	now i don_'_t know what i am giving her for christmas .
negative	thanks a lot .

negative	days after my purchase a part of my bag broke !
negative	but it is the poor customer service to get this rectified that has infuriated me most .
negative	i have sent email after email and no one responds !
negative	how unprofessional !
negative	i have a broken bag and no idea how to proceed with a refund or exchange because jules_b can '_t be asked to deal with it !
negative	my money was taken without_any problem though !
negative	funny that .... never again jules_b .....
negative	don_'_t buy from viagogo i recently bought tickets for alice keys and was charged_£_00 . 00 each for two tickets plus booking_fee ogre £_00 . 00 plus delivery fee £ 0 . 00 plus £ 0 . 00 vat total charge £_000 . 00 tickets arrived £_00 . 00 each face value !
negative	appalled or what if viagogo had just charged booking_fee , delivery and vat they '_d have still made a good profit .
negative	i will never buy tickets from them again and wouldn_'_t recommend you do .
negative	even when i phoned them up to tell them i wasn_'_t happy they didn_'_t want to know !
negative	disgusted don_'_t buy from viagogo
negative	i have used them many_times and all the flowers sent people seem happy with the flowers however once flowers were sent to my cousin for her_birthday they were not delivered and trying to call or get_hold of them is pointless its as if the company does not exist !!
negative	very frustrating !
negative	this was an heirloom from my fathers old company which shut_down years_ago .
negative	my mother who is down sizing was going to put it into the charity_shop and i did plead with her for me to have it .
negative	she said it would be about £_000 -£_000 to send down so i got on the case .
negative	interparcel are delivering this chair and its memories for a grand_total of £_00 . 00 .
negative	i am so looking_forward to receiving it and the years of memories it brings with it .
negative	after writing this review only to find out that my parcel has not been picked_up and that getting it picked_up is being problematic .
negative	i am really very unhappy as this is still not sorted onb the case tomorrow monday 00st_march_0000
negative	i ordered 0 items on 0th_september ; the website advised there was a 0 week wait for 0 of the items and the whole delivery would be sent at the same time .
negative	0nd_october nothing , so sent an_email , 0th_october no response to the email , called the free phone number ( 00000 000 000 ) but was a dead tone , had to call the 0000 number only to get through to a voicemail , 0th_october call was returned with voicemail left advising supplier delay no further details .
negative	00th_october still absolutely nothing , no delivery , no email giving an update !!!
negative	eventually after chasing via_email again i was advised by a customer service advisor on 00 / 00 that my delivery would arrive on friday 00st_october only to get another email 00th_october to be told 0 of the items would not be delivered ... cue yet another email to ' customer_services ' to be told the item was ' damaged in the warehouse ' and have now been told i can expact another few_weeks wait .
negative	how difficult is it to send 0 items in the post or at_least have continuity in information .
negative	i completely understand that things get delayed but what '_s so difficult with telling your customers .
negative	over 0_weeks from order to delivery is ridiculous , without chasing i would not have had a clue what was going on .
negative	would it be so difficult to send an_automated email to advise of supplier issues just to let customers know or is it too much_trouble for petplanet to keep their customers advised as to what is going on with the products they have paid for .
negative	above all , as one of the other_reviewers mentions , why not just use basic business sense and keep all the items in stock by stock checking !
negative	!
negative	i have used petplanet before and encountered much the same issues , albeit not quite the same delivery wait but the customer service provided is all the proof i need to not order use petplanet again .
negative	i have used groupon for years and not had any_problems until recently , and the way it '_s been handled has only aggravated me further .
negative	i purchased a voucher in december whereby i paid £_00 and received £_00 off at coast .
negative	as i was buying my bridesmaids_dresses from coast i asked all my bridesmaids to buy one so we could use it - the expiry_date at the top clearly said january_0000 .
negative	however , when i came to redeem the voucher in january , i was unable to input the code online with coast and realised that in the very fine print , the voucher itself was only valid until december and i had to get a mobile code from coast which could be used until january .
negative	when i got in touch with groupon to appeal for an_extension or get a refund due to the misleading_information on the voucher , it was clear from their response they hadn_'_t read or understood any of my message as all they did was say to me i had to get a mobile code - regardless of the fact this would then have been invalid anyway .
negative	when i complained to customer_services about their reply and repeated my desire to get a refund i didn_'_t even get a response back .
negative	i wrote a further complaint entitled " for the attention of management " i finally got a note back saying they '_d given me £_00 credit on my account as " a gesture of goodwill ".
negative	so , no refund despite having bought six we couldn_'_t use .
negative	however , when looking today , i saw they haven_'_t even put this on my account !
negative	i '_ve written again to complain but i '_m_sure i '_ll have closed by account by the time i get a reply as the service is just so appallingly shocking .
negative	i myself have come from a customer_services background and i '_d be so embarrassed if that was how my company dealt_with their customers .
negative	for anyone considering using them , do so at your_own peril !
negative	i would never use this companyy again .
negative	we waited in all day ( 0am - 0pm ) for our parcel to be collected and no one came .
negative	we were unable to contact anyone to check what had happened as the phone number they gave only operated during office hours .
negative	when i rang them the next_day , they were unable to give any reason_why no one had come to collect our parcel .
negative	they blamed the situation entirely on my hermes , the couriers who were meant to collect , despite the fact that it was interparcel through whom we booked it .
negative	they basically said we should expect this if we booked with a budget service .
negative	i suggested that if this was the case , why had we paid so much , and why did they allow us to book with myhermes on thier website .
negative	when i tried to rebook , they couldn_'_t do this for another 00_hours ( a 00 hour delay to the orginal parcel ).
negative	they wouldn_'_t guarantee a collection window and said they could only request this , meaning that i '_d have to wait in for another full day ( 0am - 0pm ).
negative	they wouldn_'_t budge , even when i said that this was due to their incompetence .
negative	i cancelled and rebooked with someone much more reliable and barely more_expensive .
negative	to top it all , myhermes tried to come and collect the parcel a week late - we were out so they left note saying they '_d come a couple of days_later .
negative	we ' re still_waiting to see if they actually come_back again - some very poor communication in this company .
negative	i ordered goods from them 0_weeks_ago and still don_'_t have them .
negative	i '_ve contacted them on 0 occasions only to be told 0 different stories .
negative	today '_s excuse is that they have been unable to fulfil my order due to demand .
negative	their paperwork is poor with no contact numbers on the email with the order number on .
negative	they are untrustworthy and unreliable .
negative	use an_alternative supplier .
negative	i use many car_hire_companies ( at_least 0 a month ) and this organisation has poor customer service , unclear documentation and are generally underhand and difficult to deal with .
negative	i ended_up with a car_hire company i hadn_'_t booked with at a location off airport , waited over an_hour for transportation and was then hit for an additional 000_euros that i had not agreed to and i '_m still fighting for a refund on .
negative	i '_ve referred the matter to my credit_card company and will take to court if_necessary .
negative	do not use and do not trust .
negative	i order a camera costing over_£_000 00 aug_0000 .
negative	i never received the camera and i '_m still_waiting for a refund ( 00 sept_0000 ).
negative	call_centre is in india and the communication is virtually non_existant .
negative	emails go without response .
negative	theyare impossible to contact and there is no address on their website .
negative	reported them to trading_standards and to googlecheckout .
negative	find someone_else to spend your money with !
negative	0 .
negative	ordered flowers to be delivered to germany 00 september to my daughter in law as my son deploying to afghanistan , confirmed that she would be at home that day .
negative	floraqueen confirmed they would deliver on 00 september .
negative	0 .
negative	flowers were not delivered on that day .
negative	0 .
negative	card was left the following_day ( saturday ) at their house when they were not in to ask them to pick_up flowers from post_office in bergen .
negative	they arrived home after post_office closed on the saturday ,.
negative	0 .
negative	post_office was not open again until monday and flowers were collected but obviously not in good condition .
negative	after waiting for 0_days for my order to be shipped ( my chemical romance , black parade poster ) they sent me a giant sunflower poster , which has nothing to do with my chemical romance .
negative	extremely disappointed , as my invoice says i did in fact order the correct poster .
negative	they just sent me the wrong one .
negative	i contacted customer_services and haven_'_t had a reply .
negative	i understand mistakes_happen but the lack of care is unbelievable .
negative	it seems as they have just sent me a random poster .
negative	very unhappy
negative	recently got a parking fine of £_00 . 00 after going to halford '_s redhill surrey and parking in the car_park with halfords sign and their own bays waiting for them to serve me - days_later £_00 . 00 parking fine .
negative	customer service has_been rubbish i even email ceo and got a standard reply with spelling_mistake .......... will never shop_here again .
negative	interesting to see if they bother to respond again .............. will keep you informed .
negative	i purchased flea_treatment on behalf of a few friends who do not have the internet and was accused of selling it on .
negative	i am extremely disappointed in the service i received .
negative	it caused myself and my friends a lot of inconvenience as their pets were needing the treatment urgently while i had to source flea_treatment from other_retailers .
negative	i received a refund , though the process took an unreasonable amount of time .
negative	i have used pet_supermarket for a number of years and have noticed they are not as good as they used to be .
negative	several orders recently have not arrived on time .
negative	my last order was 0_days late and they didn_'_t respond to my emails asking why it was delayed - so much for their pledge to answer within 0 working day .
negative	the only_thing that keeps me going back is the price .
negative	i now make_sure i order at_least a week earlier_than i need to with other_companies .
negative	after i cancelled my order of an iphone 0 , i was told i would recieve a refund within 0 working_days .
negative	since today was 00 working_days after my cancellation i called the carphone w accounts_dept and asked for the status of my refund .
negative	| was told that card refund take up to 00 working_days , but since we were on day 00 the account person agreed to look into it .
negative	she actually found out that my refund was never processed in the first place , and that she had to start the process again ... which could take up to 00 working_days !!
negative	!
negative	unprofessional does even come close to what the service really is at the carphone_warehouse .
negative	ironically they spend £_000s of £ 0000s of pounds on radio ads ( i heard 0 of them this am ) telling people " 0 / 00 of their customers are happy with their service and would recommend them to a friend ".
negative	ah ah !
negative	that also confirm they are aware of their ratings on web reviews !
negative	spend your money wisely and invest in your personnel first !
negative	booked tickets to newcastle and back for a friends 00th ( four of us ).
negative	got there okay but when we were going to return to london , we noticed some tickets missing ......
negative	with over 00_minutes to spare , i was in no panic , i was sure that this could be sorted_out so we ambled over to the travel centre to explain , they asked for the seat_numbers ( we had two , two were missing ) so we checked the original e_- mail which read no reserved_seats , despite us having two at_least !
negative	the lady at the travel centre said that there was nothing she could do and it was the choo choo trainline '_s responsibility .
negative	fair_enough , we called them .
negative	" you should have checked the tickets " was their excuse .
negative	maybe so , but have you seen the amount of tickets they send you ?
negative	receipts , reservation numbers , actual tickets , probably some shakin ' steven '_s concert_tickets in there as well .
negative	" well it '_s too late for that now , can you kindly send the reference_number over so we can get the tickets re - printed and leave byker grove to return to good ole london town ?"
negative	in short - no .
negative	i was put through to about 00 different people who were just as rude as the last .
negative	i was given their customer service number to ring .
negative	" can you just transfer the call ?"
negative	don_'_t be silly that would be far too simple .
negative	why did they not want to transfer the call ?
negative	because , as i discovered when i actually called it , it was flipping shut !
negative	i called them again , they said they '_d put me through to someone_who could help .
negative	who was it ?
negative	east_coast !
negative	who we already knew had nothing to do with this !!
negative	!
negative	we obviously missed our train , we asked them to transfer our tickets .
negative	would they ?
negative	is the pope a muslim ?
negative	the amount of time we spent on the phone to this sad excuse of a company i should have just paid the £_000_pound each they wanted for new tickets .
negative	( we originally paid £_00 )
negative	they wouldn_'_t help , they didn_'_t care that we were stranded with hardly_any money , families to return home to and it was all their fault .
negative	in the end we had to get the coach home .
negative	i cannot even begin to remind myself of the terror of that journey ...............
negative	in short , the trainline are a disgusting company .
negative	they are foul .
negative	they suck .
negative	the customer service obviously don_'_t know the meaning of the words " customer service "
negative	the whole company deserves to catch syphilis and then go to hell and be locked in a flaming hot cell with adolt hitler , fred west and jimmy saville .
negative	be assured that i will spread the word and i spread it damn good .
negative	i have not received my tiles !
negative	!
negative	my bathroom was installed under bathstore 00 months_ago .
negative	the installation was a disaster from_start to finish and despite_numerous_emails and complaints i got nowhere so just gave up .
negative	now surprisingly enough the bathroom is falling_apart .
negative	tradesmen solutions , the company who they sub - contracted the installations out to , has_gone into_administration and my 0 year ' guarantee ' is apparently void .
negative	my contract was with bathstore and i paid them the full installation fee so i don_'_t understand_why they won_'_t take_responsibility for the guarantee of workmanship .
negative	i '_ve been bounced_back and forth_between bathstore installation team and tradesmen solutions and getting_nowhere .
negative	extremely upset and frustrated after paying over the odds for a bathroom which hasn_'_t even lasted a year - i have cracked floor_tiles due to poorly installed underfloor_heating , a smashed cup_holder because it wasn_'_t attached to the wall properly , poorly sealed shower_unit , a broken led light_fitting which was supposed to last 00 years !
negative	i strongly_discourage anyone from using bathstore installation team .
negative	once they have your money they aren_'_t interested .
negative	would not use them again .
negative	will stick with inter_flora in future
negative	could of got better flowers at a petrol_station !
negative	about 00_% of the heads were wilted with the edges browning .
negative	really disappointed with this and embarrassed by them .
negative	i sent 0 business iphones to this company and nearly 0_weeks_later and after threatening them with legal_action , i have now only received 0 of the phones back .
negative	one of the phones was returned completely with the screen still smashed and the second one was supposedly fixed however the screen has a big scratch on it and the bottom half of the touch screen does not work at all .
negative	they do not respond to any emails and the phone number goes straight to voicemail / do not use this company under any circumstances !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i am a property landlord and ordered a £_000 t . v bed for 0 of my homes waited 0_days still not arrived caused total inconvenience delivery driver a liar said he called and no body home !
negative	lesson_learnt .... never order from here again !
negative	the flowers were very small looked like a £ 0 . 00 bunch i paid £_00 wrong card to go with flowers as well
negative	i ordered my glasses and paid for them through paypal .
negative	received an_email from selectspecs informing_me that the glasses i had ordered had been_discontinued .
negative	when later that month i received my credit_card bill i discovered that they had taken my money and not refunded it .
negative	i contacted them through their website requesting a refund but got no reply .
negative	i had to go to paypal to obtain a refund .
negative	as i had to go elsewhere for my glasses i was unable to pay off my credit_card bill in full and incurred charges .
negative	i still_haven_'_t heard from selectspecs not even an_apology .
negative	my 00 year_old daughter sent a ds and it correctly fitted their criteria for good condition with normal wear and tear as per the terms and conditions on their website .
negative	once received they deemed it poor condition and only offered her 0 pounds for it .
negative	it only had a couple of scratches which most people would agree is normal wear and tear and the scratches were not on the screen .
negative	you get no way to dispute what they say and they do not actually tell you why they have marked down your goods in the first place .
negative	they then charge a minimum of 00 pounds to send it back if you reject their offer .
negative	that is a lot of money to a 00 year_old .
negative	complete and utter rip_off .
negative	so after purchasing two 0rd row seats for an event that my 0 year_old_son could see the main stage , the tickets were no_longer available ?!
negative	offered me an_alternative under their guarantee service but they did not state the row number .
negative	rang in and was told that someone would ring me me back to confirm but not to worry as they offer like for like replacements .
negative	yep you got it , row 00 in a standing area so my son will have no chance of seeing anything .
negative	complained via their contact page and just got the standard response saying being looked into .
negative	rang in today to complain and spoke to a nice young_man this morning who told me someone would call me back today .
negative	no phone_call .
negative	this company is a joke and my sons_birthday_present and dream of seeing his idols up close is totally_ruined .
negative	shame on you viagogo , disgusting service .
negative	my son will be heartbroken , have not yet told him that we are no_longer in the 0rd row ..... ref_0000000 is anyone from viagogo is reading .
negative	you advertise flights at a very cheap deals and when i pressed to book , you select any country for destination , i am very angry with this site . i would not recommend anyone use this site
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	goods come from hong_kong , if they come at all .
negative	only point of contact is a single woman at a call_centre in india .
negative	this sort of thing should be outlawed
negative	i would advise everyone to avoid ever buying from this company .
negative	0_months after_placing an order - still no goods .
negative	the whole_thing is a scam .
negative	well_worth avoiding .
negative	i ordered a few items but the website was very deceiving .
negative	when they came they were very small
negative	hi ,
negative	i was wondering when we will receive the tracking no ... to track my order ,
negative	as i have had some one at the delivery property for a week and they will
negative	be going back to work this coming wed_00th_april_0000 .
negative	as we have not received anything as yet
negative	regards
negative	miss beverley kemp
negative	i '_ve_used your business before and always been happy but this time i received an_email to say the flowers and chocs had been delivered to the address but ' left in a secure_place at the front of the property '.
negative	i had specified , should the recipient not be in , for it to be delivered to any neighbour which was not done and no one rang me to tell me that presumably none of the neighbours were in .
negative	i then had to contact the recipient , spoil her surprise of flowers and tell her to hunt for her delivery .
negative	by the time she got home from work , it was 0pm and found her flowers in a green recycling_bin ….. the recycling collection was due early the next_morning so she might never have received her flowers and they were no_longer a surprise plus she had to get dirty hunting round in the dark for her flowers .
negative	appalling service and complete disregard of specifications , plus lack of communication .
negative	gibson stings are highly rated by alot of people but after fitting the stings on to my guitar i noticed they were well tarnished ?
negative	marked bordering on rusty so iwas well p **** d off i couldnt get up to play ;;; they were dud my mate said they in fact they are probably old stock ???
negative	so i dont have agood thing to say about them 00 --- 00s are a nice sound but i took them of and slung them away sorry 0 bad feedback dave
negative	good network , i wasn_'_t so impressed when my bill one month came to £_000 !
negative	i am on 000mb data allowance .
negative	one month i used 000 ish mb .
negative	you get charged something crazy like £ 0 a mb .
negative	veru unhappy .
negative	i wouldn_'_t mind if i even used the net on my phone but i don_'_t .. grrrrrrrrr , i am livid .
negative	found this great website offering free_p_&_p for all products .
negative	ordered 0 liquids from the mint and menthol range .
negative	none , that '_s right none of them were remotely minty in flavour and in fact one of them , the 00_ml mint frost , tasted down right nasty .
negative	peppermint , i was expecting peppermint .... so disappointed .
negative	i will not ordering oils again from e_liquid_world , will not be recommending it to my friends as i have done with other_sites as i '_ve just wasted £_00 of my hard_earned_cash on products which aren_'_t as they are described .
negative	i double_checked the refund policy on a base_layer top and it was agreed that i could return the item to a millets store , so i purchased 0 sizes online .
negative	they did not have the base_layer top in any of the stores that i checked at .
negative	the manager stated that they do not refund underwear !
negative	( he said that they would refund tea shirts !)
negative	it was very frustrating .
negative	the rest of the staff were sympathetic and agreed that they would feel upset if they had been mal - informed .
negative	one of them was a bit shocked at the price i had paid .
negative	the manager made various phone_calls to head_office and other stores in an attempt to find out who had reassured me that they would refund it .
negative	it took considerable time for him to eventually agree to refund .
negative	i felt very upset .
negative	at the time it took .
negative	i can not find anything in the refund policy on the web that states that they do not refund items that they consider to be underwear .
negative	sorry millets , i am unlikely to shop at millets again because i don_’_t use shops that have refund hassles .
negative	have used this company for some time to buy prescription_drug for my dog .. first a charge for using paypal , then a charge for guaranteed next_day , then a charge for insulated packaging then a hike in product cost meant in two months my bill went up £_00 for a regular purchase ..... will be using another much much_cheaper company from now on ... shame on you viovet getting more like the vets every day
negative	i was very impressed with order confirmation tracking texts & then confirmation of delivery .
negative	but not very impressed with the flowers !!!
negative	my friend sent me a photo even less impressed today to hear 0_days_later that they are nearly finished !!!!!!
negative	it was not a cheap gift £_00 .
negative	i expected them to 0 .
negative	be nicer & 0 .
negative	to at_least last longer !!!
negative	my husband bought me a beautiful_bouquet .... 00 days ago they are still fresh
negative	i was very disappointed with beautybay , i ordered and received a babybyliss pro stylist heated brush , when it arrived i found it was to big for me , i have a problem with my hand '_s , so i found this difficult to grip , i did not take it out of the wrapper .
negative	i sent you an e_- mail , asking for a returns_label , i received a e_- mail from you saying you had received my request , but i did not receive the return '_s label , or heard any more from you .
negative	so i ended_up giving the babybyliss away to my sister , so yes i am very disappointed with beautybay as that was my first item i had bought from you , so yes it has put me off buying other product '_s from you .
negative	i haven_'_t received my delivery !
negative	where did you leave it ?
negative	who signed for it ??
negative	i need it for this weekend .
negative	the order was placed over a fortnight ago - and i still_haven_'_t received it !
negative	at the start of the process i received emails relating to other_peoples cases .
negative	i was then sent an incorrect form to complete , when i did get the correct form and submitted it there were some bits of evidence needed that were missing but the forms had not been checked with the excuse " staff are not trained in that particular form ".
negative	it was a fees exempt form which i would have thought was a fairly standard form .
negative	emails go unanswered and they seem to need constant prompting to update the case and move onto the next stage .
negative	complete_waste of money , if you have more than two brain cells you are better off submitting the forms yourself it will be so much_cheaper and so much less_stressful .
negative	this company made an extremely difficult time even more difficult .
negative	update after response :
negative	so sending emails relating to other cases , not replying to emails , having to ask the same question 0 times before getting an answer ( i can provide evidence of such if required ), needing to constantly prompt you to move onto the next stage ( which is the only_reason my divorce was completed in 0_months nothing to do with your service ) that constitutes " no_issues with our service to you " does it ?
negative	says it all really
negative	i just wanted to warn_people before booking with this company - not to use them
negative	they are actually the worst company i ever dealt_with .
negative	i booked 0 tickets coming_back from belgrade to london .
negative	i confirmed it all online which was correct .
negative	after there was something wrong with the payment i called the next_day to pay over the phone .
negative	after getting the email_confirmation later that day , i saw they autocorrected the main persons_name on the tickets to the card_holders name when taking the payment over the phone .
negative	once i saw the error i called but couldn ’_t get_hold of anyone for weeks , just got told i had to email to get the name corrected again .
negative	eventually someone got back to me and they refused to fix their error .
negative	i had to cancel the flight , pay cancelation fees and rebook which i did with another company .
negative	after waiting for the refund for 0_weeks , we found we were refunded all 0 flights less 0 cancelation fees after we specifically_asked them to only cancel 0 flight
negative	by now the flights have gotten much more_expensive and they refused to un - cancel the flights or let us pay the same amount we originally paid for them
negative	eventually the flight sold out and all 0 of us have to catch all separate flights home and have paid loads more plus cancelation fees .
negative	they refuse to give any discounts or money off even_though it was 000_% their error .
negative	they also never reply to emails , i had to send the same email 00 times in a row from 0 different email addresses just so 0 person would respond .
negative	0_months later we are still pending the refund but otherwise things seem to be sorted as we re - booked new flights through another company
negative	i am usually very calm when it comes to these kind of issues but this was the worst airline and worst booking experience i have ever dealt_with .
negative	i really don_’_t want anyone to have to go through what i did so please don_'_t use this company !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i thought i would share my dfs customer service experience with you .
negative	dfs brentford customer service is shocking and very bad !!!
negative	my sofa was delivered this afternoon .
negative	delivery guys told me that i own x amount money and i have to pay now otherwise i can '_t keep the sofa .
negative	i told them i have paid during my purchase and they need to check their records .
negative	after several phone_calls i was told that no proof of payment and i need to pay again .
negative	according to the dfs brentford i was lying and didn_'_t pay when i was telling the truth !!!
negative	i tried to explain that i can find my statement if required but it wasn_'_t enough .
negative	this lady from brentford store ( who was store manager ) kept going about me not telling the truth and they can '_t find any proof of payment etc .
negative	eventually she hanged up the phone .
negative	i found my statement , showed delivery guys but apparently it wasn_'_t enough .
negative	basically they found my payment receipt after 0 hour drama .
negative	they are not even sorry for being wrong and not keeping track of their customer records etc !!!!
negative	no apologies from them .
negative	i was and am still upset about the poor service brentford dfs has given to me !!!
negative	please_avoid if possible .
negative	according to dfs the customer is never right !!
negative	!
negative	i found a maggot in a piece of cheese bought from aldi which still had more than a month before it '_s expiry_date .
negative	when contacting aldi customer_services to complain i was contacted by phone and told that they would not refund the cheese as i did not have the receipt and had thrown the cheese in the bin .
negative	when i started to explain how disgusted i was i patronised by the agent telling_me to stop shouting at her and she was terminating the call .
negative	i did not shout at her and she just continued to tell me she was terminating the call .
negative	i said i would write a review about this and i was told " go on then " and was cut_off .
negative	i have only been with scottish_power for 0_months and have never in my life known anything like it .
negative	" we are experiencing high volumes of calls and the wait will be 0 hours 00_mins , your call is moving to the front of the queue " if you don_'_t have a hands free phone find somewhere comfortable to sit .
negative	i was on hold for 0hour 00mins during this time i did all my housework and 0 lots of washing with the phone cradled against my ear only to be cut_off by the stupid woman_who couldn_'_t get my name right .
negative	i give my readings online but the woman said they can '_t be correct .
negative	i assure they are correct but she was having none of it .
negative	then they decided all my metre reading were wrong so i received a cheque wa hey !
negative	£_000 . 00p i was delighted .
negative	turns_out i had to pay them the cheque amount back as they had made a mistake .
negative	i am absolutely_livid and am deffinatly changing suppliers .
negative	i was really upset by the treatment i received from this company .
negative	i ordered many miniatures for my brother 00th_birthday_present .
negative	i payed £ 0 for p_&_p ,
negative	i ordered on the 00th_december and did not receive my order till the 00st of december even_though the order specified 0 - 0_days .
negative	i e_- mailed with a complaint as i had not received it , they did not even apologize they just said that they could see it had been delayed !
negative	and that i should receive by the following_monday .
negative	i feel completely let_down .
negative	and matters were made worse when 0 of the items i ordered did not arrive as apparently was not in stock , however they did not e_- mail me to let_me know !
negative	i then had to go out and buy extra miniatures from my local_supermarket to make up the gift .
negative	completely gutted !
negative	didn_'_t even get a refund on my p_&_p let_alone a discount for my inconvenience .
negative	i will not order from them again !
negative	if you live in a flat , don_'_t use unless you are prepared to collect your order from the main door no matter what size it is .
negative	left me with two large boxes to get up the stairs on my own after just having a baby and having to leave her on her own to deal with the delivery .
negative	in 0 years i have never come_across this and the company i ordered from many_times before has lost my custom while they continue to use this company to deliver their stuff
negative	tried to find out what time my parcel might arrive since it had been loaded_onto van at 00 . 00 this morning .
negative	was told they couldn_'_t help .
negative	i asked if they could call driver - the reply was that they don_'_t have mobiles .
negative	but , i whimpered , is there nothing you can do .
negative	reply : if it can be left with a neighbour i could text to let driver know .
negative	hello what do you use to text ?
negative	operator replied ( in an irritated manner ) we can only text we ' re not allowed to ring .
negative	oh ok can you text him then and ask what sort of time he might be in my area , morning or afternoon .
negative	no was the response .
negative	as simple and abruptly as that .
negative	sack her i say .
negative	i cannot_comment on the quality of the glasses as i have still not received my order that was placed on the 00th_may .
negative	some of the customer service advisors are rude and arrogant .
negative	keep being told i will receive by such and such date , when that date passes i get told another .
negative	was told on friday i would receive in 00 - 00_hours but i '_m not holding my breath
negative	i am thoroughly disappointed .
negative	i chose a winter design , all in dark colours and the most expensive on your international_shipping choices .
negative	whilst i read and understood the disclaimer about the availability of exact design , the lack of any foliage and random yellow and white flowers which did not match have left me completely disappointed .
negative	what a shame when it was to congratulate my daughter and her husband on the birth of their son .
negative	i would welcome your comments and am worried others would be equally disgusted .
negative	ordered flowers on sunday , to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday the following wednesday , as advertised .
negative	wednesday came no flowers , thursday royal_mail attempted to deliver flowers but mum was out , royal_mail re delivered flowers on saturday_morning , and i wish they hadnt .
negative	flowers have been lying in a box without water for a few_days , they were wilting and turnign brown .
negative	phoned customer service , not interested , they have not broken any contract , flowers were sent out .
negative	they also fail to respond to further emails sent , have been promised someone will phone me soon ( 0_days ago ) nothing .
negative	basically they are not interested they have got the money for the flowers , they dont care how and when they are delivered .
negative	so basically have paid for dead flowers to be deliverd to my mum 0_days after her_birthday .
negative	so upsetting and stressful for my mum and me .
negative	never again .
negative	the sub - total came to £_00 . 00 plus p_&_p , but the original offer was £_00 . 00 !!
negative	how did this happen ?!
negative	!
negative	i ordered £_000 worth of goods .
negative	it looks a fantastic proffesional site .
negative	better_than others iv visited for the items i needed .
negative	anyway the money was immediately taken from my account , and i recieved an_email_saying my order was being_processed and waiting to be despached .
negative	two_weeks down the line still no goods .
negative	telephoned and i had an answer with the tele no they suggest to ring .
negative	after_seeing this site i cancelled the order and was told i would recieve my refund the following friday .
negative	this was monday .
negative	no refund telephoned again and they said as it was a large_amount they will have to send it by cheque ?????????????
negative	mmmmmm '
negative	anway i did recieve it a week_later on a saturday .
negative	there were no good .
negative	otherwise i would of had them .
negative	from now on ill be checking the sites thoroughly before purchasing anything .
negative	from the time they took my payment it was a month before i got my money back .
negative	also i sent numerous_emails had none back at first but the 0th week they did reply each time i emailed them .
negative	i would not use this site again , but its so proffesionaly done it stands_out from the others .
negative	pity the service wasnt the same .
negative	mike seemed a nice guy on the phone and appologetic .
negative	but that means nothing for the service .
negative	like previous reviewers , i spent over 0 0 / 0 hrs on the phone today , mainly listening to music .
negative	i only switched to scottish_power in november , and after my meter was read today , i wished to check on my opening account readings .
negative	i checked into my account on line to be informed in red letters that my readings were overdue .
negative	i was informed initially that an e_- mail would be sent when they wanted a reading for my account .
negative	this i had not received so i contacted them to confirm the procedure .
negative	after waiting approx 00mins , i was answered by a very offhand fellow who told me he didn_’_t have access to my account and therefore could not discuss my account with me .
negative	however he did tell me that as this was an online account it was my responsibility to check to see if a reading was required !
negative	he then said he would transfer me to the right person .
negative	all he did was put me back to the switchboard where i waited another 00mins and i then got somebody_else who although more pleasant could not access my account either .
negative	i eventually spoke to a manager who said i had been misinformed and that i should have received an e_- mail requesting a reading .
negative	whilst talking to her .
negative	i was trying to access my account on line , as i had another question about the account .
negative	i was informed firstly my e_- mail address was wrong , and then my password was wrong .
negative	however both of these i had entered correctly .
negative	subsequently she told me that i would need to reset my password as they were having problems with there web_site ., they would send me and e_- mail to enable me to do this , but this could take anytime from 0 - 00_hrs .
negative	i have been using energy companies for 00_yrs and have never been anywhere_near close to this experience .
negative	unfortunately i am on a fixed price tariff until february_0000 , with a £_00 exit_fee should i leave before then .
negative	for the sake of my sanity i am seriously_considering paying this fee , as i cannot bear the thought of all the aggravation , should i need to contact them again .
negative	sorry i left you atlantic energy !
negative	magsie bromley
negative	still wating for my product from 0_weeks_ago , will never shop with then again !
negative	i don_'_t understand_why pretty_much the whole of scotland is considered an extended areas in the uk which may has additional surcharge for postage .
negative	it costs no more to send to glasgow than it does to send to manchester and if their courier is charging them an extra £_00 to deliver a medium package to glasgow then they should sack their supply_chain manager .
negative	dont don_'_t waste your time going through to checkout with purchases if you don_'_t live in england as delivery will cost you .
negative	y
negative	i received a phone_call from talk_talk saying that they wanted to give me a free tv package upgrade as they wanted to make_sure their existing_customers received the same deal as that offered to new customers .
negative	he insisted several_times that i install the box as quickly as i could so that they could check it was working correctly and if i didn_'_t they could charge me for the box .
negative	so i agreed to the free upgrade and only towards the end of the call did he say that my contract would be extended for a further 00 months .
negative	now , i was not an unhappy talk_talk customer as have been with them for years and so , caught offhand and realising that you get nothing for nothing no matter what the sales_guy tells you , i said okay .
negative	the box and router arrived lunchtime on 0th_november and my husband connected it that evening .
negative	now for a variety of reasons including exposed cabling and router in the hall , dissatisfaction with tv offering and the fact that our smart_tv offered an equivalent service we decided to return the tv box and ask that we return to our old package of tv and broadband with the contract ending in a few_months .
negative	this is where the trouble started .
negative	firstly i spoke to an agent who asked me the details of why we wanted to return it .
negative	she passed me onto someone in the loyalty team who again asked why we didn_'_t want it and he tried hard to convince us to keep it .
negative	i was adamant that we didn_'_t want it and was dumbfounded to hear that it would cost us £_000 to return it .
negative	i explained that at no time was this ever mentioned in the initial call selling us the deal , but he was equally adamant that we keep it or pay £_000 as the telephone and broadband deal we were on prior to this upgrade was not now available .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor and after hanging on for a long while got through to a supervisor in india .
negative	again i explained the situation and again the reasons we did not want the package and asked him why we couldn_'_t return the tv box under the distance_selling rules or under the 00 day cooling_off period .
negative	he agreed that we shouldn_'_t have to pay the £_000 and i then asked him to organise that our account go back to its status before the " free " tv upgrade .
negative	his computer failed and he had to call me back a while later .
negative	on his return call he confirmed i could return the tv box and router , there would be no charge and he would arrange a return delivery bag .
negative	he then passed me to the cancellations team to have my account returned to its original status .
negative	imagine my frustration when the agent started from scratch telling_me i couldn_'_t cancel and it would cost £_000 to return the tv box - nothing on my file about not being charged !
negative	i asked to speak to the supervisor who had passed the call to him ( mario i think ) but instead was put through to a heavily accented supervisor called rheyn suabez who told me it was not possible to return the box without_incurring a charge and that i had agreed to an_extension to my contract and the distance_selling rules and 00 day cooling_off period did not apply as i had connected the device the night before .
negative	i explained hat this was only because the sales_rep had urged me several_times to get do this as quickly as possible after receipt .
negative	i now had a 00 month_contract and a tv package i did not want .
negative	the other option was to break the contract which would cost me £_000 !
negative	on checking the terms and conditions i see that because i connected i will be deemed to have accepted these terms and conditions and agree that you will also lose your statutory right of cancellation under the regulations .
negative	so that was why the sales_guy placed so much emphasis on getting it connected so quickly .
negative	the minute you switch it on your are stuffed !
negative	i have gone from being an ambivalent customer to now being a very frustrated and angry one : {
negative	perhaps now i shouldn_'_t be surprised talktalk is prepared to employ such tactics to hand - cuff disaffected customers for relatively_short_term , comparatively minimal financial gain , rather_than have them actively want to stay because of good service and good value .
negative	do not trust anything these people say to you on the phone .
negative	do not agree to anything on the phone until you see all their ambiguous terms and conditions or you will be trapped into their 00 month plan .
negative	******* update *******
negative	received phone_call from talk_talk last night agreeing to roll back my contract and arrange free uplift of tv box after registering complaint with them .
negative	maybe they are getting their act_together .
negative	i ordered my costumes on monday 00st_october and paid for them to be delivered by thursday 00th .
negative	i have not received my goods , i have paid just under_£_000 for !
negative	i have tried_calling the number provided for the past 0_days where all i get is an engaged_tone , and i have emailed 0 times without getting a response !
negative	appalling customer service !
negative	having been advised that my delivery was due between 00am and 0pm , it eventually arrived at 0pm .
negative	i received one call at 0pm telling_me my order would definitely be with me at 0pm , then nothing .
negative	from the calls i made to follow_up , i gather that the delivery van had broken down , but no - one thought to keep me informed .
negative	poor service .
negative	on sunday 0th_january i ordered a mattress from world_stores and although it said next_day delivery i opted for wednesday 0th_january .
negative	waited in yesterday and by mid - morning was beginning to feel slightly uneasy especially as on the tracking it was still showing as being at the collection depot as at 0th_jan - googled xdp express and came_across this website and having read the reviews omg !
negative	what have i done !!!
negative	i emailed xdp at 00 . 00am asking them to confirm the mattress was being delivered on the 0th .
negative	at 00 . 00pm i received an_email from xdp saying ' it wont_be out today , i have not received any freight for delivery today .
negative	i will call you as soon as i receive the goods and arrange delivery with you '.
negative	thats no good to me having taken a day off work especially for the delivery and unable to have any more time off ' til easter .
negative	not going to mess around waiting in day after day like other people have done so emailed world_stores telling them i want to cancel the order and asking for a refund and also spoke to trading_standards just so i know my rights on cancelling the order - got automated email reply from world_stores and now awaiting an_email / phone_call from them which better be pretty soon .
negative	knew i should have ordered from john_lewis in the first place .
negative	if anyone from xdp express reads this , you really need to sort yourselves out , take_note how dhl , yodel , royal_mail and all the other delivery businesses work cos somewhere you ' re going badly wrong .
negative	i lost 0 parcels which stated it was delivered to me .
negative	i paid_extra to be delivered for a birthday_gift , the next_day .
negative	never got the parcel ...!!
negative	when i went on to the website , it tells_me i can not contact hermes , i must contact the company who send me the parcel .
negative	when i contacted the company they showed me a strange signature , which does not belong to me or any of my family , and this is the second time .
negative	how can that be .... why can '_t a parcel be traced .... was it delivered , or not .
negative	how can they get away with things like that .
negative	deliver to a strange person , and wash their hands of the whole situation .
negative	i would share this review , but rather not ....
negative	a parcel i had been waiting on from australia for 0 - 0_months arrived when i was on holiday abroad .
negative	my first complaint is that only two attempted delivery notes had been left in the mail , but the last of them said it had been the third delivery attempt .
negative	i rescheduled the delivery online for the next working day and was patiently sat waiting for the whole of the ( unacceptable ) delivery window ( 0am - 0pm ).
negative	when no parcel showed up , i called the number on the call card and was told that the parcel had been returned to sender , without_any notification of this .
negative	yodel could give me no information whatsoever of the whereabouts of my package , no tracking_number , not even the name of the carrier who now has it or what address it is going to .
negative	the person on the phone just kept saying yodel don_'_t do international_deliveries and therefore cannot help me .
negative	my parcel is now lost , and as the sender was myself when i still lived in australia , there is no sender to take care of the package when it arrives .
negative	sent bouquet to cheer_up sick_relative which it certainly did .
negative	flowers delivered on time and as told the arrangement was stunning considering the price paid .
negative	i have used this service previously and all the recipients have been delighted .
negative	would not_hesitate to recommend .
negative	bought an item online on the 0th still not been received .
negative	money got taken from account immediately .
negative	attempts to contact by email have been ignored .
negative	attempts to contact via_facebook received sarcastic unhelpful response .
negative	no telephone_number available anywhere .
negative	would never buy online from this company again !
negative	!
negative	unfortunately i was disappointed with the service provided .
negative	i had paid £ 0 . 00 for a next_day service which was messed_up by_fedex and i spent_ages chasing the parcel which was eventually delivered in 0_days .
negative	fedex admitted it was their fault and told me to contact partyrama for a refund .
negative	however i tried to explain it they would only refund £ 0 as £ 0 . 00 was the charge for a 0 day delivery .
negative	i requested and paid for a next_day service which was not honored and should have been refunded in full , even fed_ex thought i should but it had to be initiated from partyrama .
negative	i felt their response very poor and i would not have confidence ordering products from them if that is how they deal with a delivery issue .
negative	i submitted 00 books to this company , some of them brand_new and only one was taken on as ' acceptable ', for which i received the grand_total of 00p - for 00 books !
negative	they do not return goods , and have a non exsistent public policy as to what is deemed acceptable and what is not .
negative	having traded in goods via_amazon trade in , and zapper , i find it hard to believe that new books would not pass their examination process .
negative	what they are doing with their arbitary acceptance process , and non return of goods amounts to thef .
negative	avoid !
negative	i '_d like to know why your company is so incompetent ?
negative	i was to be connected on the 0nd_april .
negative	assured that the engineer didn_'_t knock my door as he " just had to connect the phone line ".
negative	after two_days of ringing your company and being passed around , i get a phone_call from an engineer today asking me if i was at home so he could connect my phone line as he can '_t find the connection box , this is because it is inside my block of flats and was supposed to have been connected on the 0nd .
negative	i had booked a days holiday for this so i was at work when i took the phone_call .
negative	as you can probably tell by now i was not very happy and decided to ring bt to find out if my phone number has_been connect .
negative	no it hasn_'_t .
negative	so your company has not only lied to me on the past five phone_calls as they told me it was the router that was the problem when in actual fact the engineer never came to my flat .
negative	i don_'_t have any internet but i do have an_enormous phone bill which no one from your company has even mentioned about compensating me for and no date or time in which this engineer will come out and actually connect my phone line .
negative	if this isn_'_t resolved soon i will be leaving talktalk and go else where .
negative	as you are not providing me with any service .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from you
negative	laura wells
negative	have young_child with quite severe dyspraxia and sensory intergration dysfunction .
negative	claimed vat_exemption but then still been charged it at checkout contacted company they said mistake on website and they would refund waited week still no refund emailed again this time ignored completly .
negative	once they have your money there is no further customer service .
negative	i am still_waiting my order ... since 00 . 00 . 0000 !!
negative	today we are in 00 . 00 . 0000 !!!
negative	horrible !
negative	!
negative	my flowers arrieved last friday .
negative	i was most disapponted , having spent £_00 . 00 on the bouquet , this was not value for money .
negative	in fact they have not lasted and i had to throw them away yesterday , tues 0 sept .
negative	a refund would be in order .
negative	i asked eflorist to send another bunch .
negative	but i did not get an answer to my complaint .
negative	would not use them again .
negative	we had to pay extra money to the driver because we werent at home when he delivered , but he hadnt told us when he was planning to deliver the goods in first place .
negative	no flexibility , the driver was rude and threatened to keep the goods if we didnt pay him extra .
negative	let_me explain what i booked and why i do not rate this establishment and wouldn_'_t recomend :
negative	bailgate apartments 00 bailgate lincoln ln0 0ap
negative	standard double room for 0 person
negative	rooms over_£_00 include and english_breakfast served at the duke william and car_parking is available @ £ 0 for 00_hours .
negative	l . there is no such place as bailgate apartments .
negative	there is a bailgate hotel , but don_'_t confuse them .
negative	additionally neither will house numbers help .. as they jump from 00 - to - 00 i had a moment of anxiety that i '_d booked a scammers b_& b !
negative	l saw breakfast was served at the duke of william pub ( clearly_visible ) so i entered and asked - " surprise " this was where my reservation was !
negative	0 .
negative	after booking a double ( see above ) i was told was getting an upgrade to a double ?!
negative	as i '_d not booked one ??...
negative	rubbish i '_d clearly booked just that !
negative	!
negative	0 .
negative	i was told of the process of late entry .
negative	lt seemed very secure & reassuring .
negative	they forgot to mention that it would be through back roads , a dark alley and past unlit lockups !!
negative	as a single_female traveller it was another heart in mouth moment !
negative	0 .
negative	i had hopes as i walked_into a fairly presentable but basic room .
negative	-.
negative	they were soon dashed when i smelt the toilet in my room !.
negative	yuck .. flushing helped !
negative	along with a yankee candle room spray l took
negative	0 .
negative	the windows rattle , the heating_system booms and the tv only worked on the football channel ... some where there was a box that needed resetting ?
negative	according to the message on the screen !
negative	why hadn_'_t his been checked as working ?
negative	0 . worst of all and unforgivable really .... there was " no hot_water " -.- none either from the tap or shower !
negative	i did report it but with no apology or aid .
negative	the man who took full payment of £_00 with no hot_water said " he '_d have it fixed before i stayed again ?"
negative	... in this regard it had just hit rock_bottom .
negative	a b_& b with a blatant lack of standards , service or care - - i wouldn_'_t stay again !!
negative	!.
negative	customer service and basic '_s are missing here !
negative	~ avoid it !
negative	concerns abound ... if hot_water isn_'_t available for paying guests ?
negative	that said .
negative	-.
negative	breakfast was well cooked ..- well_done chef !
negative	no stars given i placed my order on the 0nd of december it was dispatched on the 0rd of december , i called on saturday the 00th and was told to wait_till wednesday 00th for my parcel , i still hadn_'_t recieved it so i called again an i was offered a replacement the wouldn_'_t get her in time for xmas even_though i stated it was a present and wasn_'_t offered a replacement in time for xmas just a refund and not even an apologie .
negative	this has mad me really angry as now i have to find a replacement present with only 0_days till xmas , but then i recieve an_email from cheap_smells stating order now to get gaurenteed xmas delivery , i called back and was told i cant have that unless i upgrade , take_responsibility when your wrong and help customers who you have wronged by not delivering to . i will not use cheap_smells again unless this is rectified , and will tell all family an friends who all use cheap_smells not to again because there is no reconciliation for when a mistake is made by yourselves especially round xmas
negative	the worst customer service i have ever_experienced in a company ever !
negative	they seem to completely disregard consumer_rights and make rules up as they go along .
negative	item purchased was faulty and they deducted a percentage as it had been used ... erm how do you discover it is faulty without using !
negative	disgusting .
negative	avoid you have been warned !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my family and i sat waiting for our food , all starvin !!
negative	which never turned_up .
negative	i phoned the chinese who said they had not received any order and had received several calls within the last half an_hour from other customers waiting for their food !
negative	called just - eat - who reassured me it wasnt my fault !!!!
negative	cheeky gits , and simply said that when the order had been sent to the chinese they had rejected it ????
negative	i enquired whether it was not normal practice for them to tell me about this , save us waiting for our food and they said they usually do but this one seemed to just slip through the net !
negative	!
negative	wont_be using them again i '_m afraid !
negative	very good i got my order the next_day .
negative	avoid buying from this company at all costs .
negative	their website offers next_day delivery - it took weeks and when the cartridges arrived they were useless .
negative	you cannot get through on the phone to complain and when you email them it takes days for a reply which is a standard reply and they have no intentions of helping .
negative	i returned a new cartridge which didn_'_t work and they have denied receiving it .
negative	will never use them again .
negative	poor in all departments .
negative	i used this company to send thousands of parcels but stopped a while ago .
negative	they have no live_chat as advertised , they tell you c a courier can call between_0am - 0pm but there phones close at 0 !
negative	meaning a missed collection takes another two_days unlike_other_companies they won_'_t send out another courier at their expense .
negative	on top of this they overbook dramatically , they will take however many bookings they can and still claim they '_ll be collected the next_day which sometimes must be a physical impossibility .
negative	avoid these people .
negative	use [_external_reference_] or just anybody_else .
negative	do not use them !
negative	they offered me a two month free trial with credit vouchers i put in the codes to come_back .
negative	these codes would not work , so tried several_times .
negative	they ended_up taking four payments from my account !
negative	after i had complained and informed them , they still took it out several days .
negative	i have emailed them and they say it will take 0 - 0 working_days to be approved and refunded .
negative	this was after finding they took two payments , i then discovered another two so have now had to email them again .
negative	it is fraudulent and a mis selling of their products .
negative	i would not recommend them due to this situation and their poor choice of films available instantly .
negative	do not use !
negative	i have read feedback on this site and a lot of it is negative , which is bad_news for the brand , but they appear to not care as they keep_repeating the same bad customer service and poor business mistakes .
negative	booked a " next_day delivery ", 00 paintings wrapped in 0 large parcels .
negative	they were collected by a man in a plain_white van , who said he had no paperwork for anything for me to sign .
negative	0 hours_later another citylink van arrived , and the second guy insisted i signed his console , even_though he didn_'_t collect the paintings .
negative	it goes without saying that the paintings arrived 0_days late , meaning blank walls at the exhibition , and the cancellation of the opening .
negative	i had travelled down myself for the opening , paying for 0 nights in a hotel plus travel .
negative	as if that wasn_'_t bad enough , one parcel of ten painting is now " lost , and will not be found ".
negative	the tracking showed it didn_'_t even make it to the depot in my town where it was collected , which means it is still on the first idiot '_s van .
negative	or has fallen out of it , which isn_'_t surprising when i saw the way he squashed my valubale stuff into his manky old transit .
negative	and trying to claim for this - they say the will do nothing , and the case is closed .
negative	to make_matters even worse , the guy_who collected my stuff and basically must have taken it home for 0_days appeared at my door with an item i '_d ordered from amazon , and denied everything when questioned about my missing paintings .
negative	it '_s bad enough when they lose items ( how does that even happen ?!)
negative	but when they basically laugh at you for being so stupid as to trust them , it '_s beyond a joke .
negative	the customer service is simply appalling .
negative	on more than one occasion , yodel have left my parcels with my wheelie bins , totally indiscreetly with valuable goods inside .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable and is not a safe location - all of my neighbours are happy to keep parcels on my behalf and do so on a regular_basis with all other delivery services i have used .
negative	well , i brought 0 lady_gaga tickets for stade de france in april of this year .
negative	it is now exactly 00 days till the event and do not have any sign of tickets being dispatched and i know tickets dont usually get sent " 0 - 0_weeks till the event " but i have put a lot of time and money into this trip and as i am travelling from england i would like to be assured that the seller will be sending them soon as possible .
negative	me and my friend are both hardcore gaga fans and decided that because at the time she was sold out in manchester and london nothing would stop us so decided to use the website which i have heard was so " great " which was of course viagogo . co . uk , this is my first time in dealing_with this website and i can safely say this will be the last .
negative	i have sent an_email_saying that if i do not recieve an_email_saying they have been dispatched by the 00th_sept then i will be requesting for a full_refund and putting in a formal_complaint !
negative	my transaction_id is 0000000 and if i could get an actual_human response that would be a bonus too !
negative	item ( premium jeans from a leading department_store ) delivered on time and undamaged , but by the rudest delivery man i '_ve ever_encountered .
negative	i live in flats , so need to buzz delivery people in .
negative	instead of pressing the bell once or twice then waiting , he kept his finger constantly on the buzzer until i picked_up the entry - phone , and even then wouldn_'_t take it off .
negative	he then stormed up the stairs ( giving me no opportunity to tell him which floor i '_m on ) and threw the parcel at my front_door without waiting for me to open it .
negative	worse still , i had foot surgery a week_ago and am at home recovering , so really could have done without this !
negative	absolutely_disgusted , and will be writing to the retailer to say that i will not be ordering from them again if they continue to use hermes .
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00 : continuing to have problems with any delivery by myhermes , and suspect it may be the same driver each time .
negative	( i can '_t tell for sure , as i '_ve never actually seen him - not even when i '_m at home , awaiting delivery .
negative	this doesn_'_t stop him from claiming that the " parcel was handed to resident " after he '_s left it somewhere where it '_s likely to get nicked .)
negative	ordered the wrong_size did not realize til delivered .
negative	policy return yourself by arranging own courier with payment .
negative	i suggested that we could exchange when replacement delivered our courier only delivers they do not collect .
negative	having used the internet on many occasions for both large and small itens i have never before had to arrange a return myself .
negative	customer service leaves a lot to be desired , i have not returned the mattress nor ordered a replacement from this company
negative	i would not recommend them at all
negative	i ordered my item on the 00 december and as it said 0 / 0 day delivery and it was in stock i thought it would have arrived before christmas , it did not arrive so i emailed them twice , i must_admit i did receive one email back , but not very helpful i kept looking to see if it had been dispatched , but no it kept saying awaiting dispatch , although the money had been taken from my account on the day ordered as other people have already said .
negative	i have just phoned them and was told they did not have time to send before christmas and will be sending in a couple of days , although i will not be holding my breath on that one .
negative	i wish i had seen this site before i ordered as i would never had placed an order . be warned do not touch this website with a barge_pole they can not fulfill their promises and are a complete_waste of time and money .
negative	complete_care had still not delivered my order a month after_placing it and despite me chasing a number of times .
negative	i decided to cancel the order and i '_ve now called twice to find out where my refund is .
negative	the customer service team are not able to give me any indication of when to expect the refund , unable to speak to the warehouse the same day , unable to escalate to a manager and don_'_t call back to follow_up when they say they will .
negative	i '_ve resorted to opening a dispute with paypal to get this sorted .
negative	the almonds i purchased tasted really bitter .
negative	i would not buy them again .
negative	i have been contacted 00 times in 0_days by this company .
negative	i have never been a customer and they are trying to make me upgrade my phone with them .
negative	i purchased something over 0yrs_ago from them not a phone and i certainly didnt give them my phone number i am registered with tps , so why are they harassing me .................. never in a million years would i buy even a earphone from them now
negative	awful pushy and not prepared to do anything about my complaint the sooner this company goes out of business the better !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	when i ring the automated no on the card its telling_me my parcel is delivered well where i dont have it !
negative	cant find a phone number anywhere to speak to some one have to sit around waiting for a crappy email response , what about people that dont have the internet ?
negative	total pants just creates a bad vibe .
negative	order was placed beginning of may , still_waiting on items ... had paid an extra premium for 0 - 0 day delivery ????
negative	chased up by email and was told one of the three items out of stock .
negative	i sent reply just to cancel that one item and send remaining two .
negative	no reply .
negative	again chased by email , same again .
negative	told one item out of stock and replied asking for no alternative just send the other two items .
negative	and so it continued .
negative	this is now the 00th of june , about 0 - 0_weeks at_least since order was placed and still nothing .
negative	order just appears on tracking as ' in process '.
negative	finally today after trying to contact by email and telephone i requested my order just be cancelled .
negative	i really wanted the two items for a particular event in may but that did not happen .
negative	disappointed in lack of service in general .
negative	will not recommend this sight to any of my club members .
negative	which is a shame .
negative	i recently_purchased a solid_oak_dining_table with 0 chairs and an oak_sideboard from wowcher , totalling nearly_£_000 . 00 !
negative	we were in the process of moving_house so didn_’_t open it straight_away left it all wrapped up , in the packaging etc … to open it last sunday to find the dining_table all broken underneath !
negative	i contacted mountrose who the table was supplied from and they said to contact wowcher direct .
negative	on monday i called wowcher and they advised me to e_mail the damaged photos over to them and someone would return my e_mail that day ….
negative	surprise_surprise nothing heard .
negative	so i called tuesday to be advised “ the lady in despatch wasn_’_t in yesterday ” one lady ?!
negative	ok , no problem , someone would look at my damaged photos and get back to me that day ( tuesday )… by 0 pm id still not heard a whisper , so i called again wednesday to be told someone would get back to me that day … sure enough by 0pm id had an e_mail yippee !...
negative	they wanted to see damaged photos ( id already sent these on monday ) !!
negative	and wanted to know a day the following week when someone would be available to pick the table up ….
negative	after a long wait trying to get through to customer_services , they advised me that the lady_named kennedy had gone home now and she was working her way through the various e_mails and mine hadn_’_t got to the top !
negative	here ’_s a suggestion wowcher employ more than one person then !
negative	so here we are friday_afternoon and i ’_m still_waiting to see if my table is going to be picked_up in just0 days ’ time as i have to arrange somebody to sit at home all day whilst they come … and weather the new table will be delivered on the same day !...
negative	i have bought several items from wowcher and will never buy from them again after this utter_rubbish customer experience !
negative	i emailed to say i would be unable to ' unload the goods on arrival ' mainly_because my arm is in plaster .
negative	i said if this was going to be a problem obviously i would have to cancel the order .
negative	no response
negative	the due date for delivery came and not knowing whether i was still going to have the delivery i rang - no answer and emailed asking if they could advise .
negative	no response
negative	so , they have taken almost £ 0000 and still i have had no response and no delivery .
negative	scandalous company , advertising totally fictitious prices !
negative	they say ' good availability ' on selected seats but they are mysteriously ' sold out ' when you phone and then they quote a much higher price ( almost_double ).
negative	the website is also a con , it looks like your going to be able to book the flights but when you go through to the payment page the price shoots up , if you didn_'_t notice you could end up booking at a much higher price !
negative	representatives are incredibly rude and patronising when you phone making out you ' re stupid for even thinking you can get flights at the advertised price !
negative	awful that they are allowed to continue trading and awful that skyscanner continues to include them in searches !
negative	it kept saying i lived in a flat and i had to manually write the installation address but couldn_'_t change to other address so in a week or so we will see where my router ends up !!??
negative	hopefully not a sign of things to come !!
negative	!
negative	in brief ....
negative	i have my refund !
negative	woohoo !
negative	.
negative	date of order : 00st_july_0000
negative	date of lens received back by se : 00th_august_0000
negative	date of refund into my bank : 00st_september_0000
negative	so , it has taken almost 0_weeks from the time they received the lens back to the time of my refund back into the bank .
negative	00 emails , 0 phone_calls ( i gave up phoning because they can only stick to the script , not actually help at all ).
negative	nice little_earner for this company , if they keep people '_s money for this long , they are getting the interest .
negative	if you have ordered from them and your item has arrived safe and sound that '_s great , well_done ........ just check that it isn_'_t a counterfeit item and pray to your higher being that you never have to return it because it '_s faulty .
negative	never as long as i have to breathe air to live , will i deal with this company and it '_s incompetent , robotic staff again .
negative	when i expected the ordered from petsupermarket to deliver my package by royal_mail , as , i was told by an_email .
negative	unfortunately , my package was in the street , two road away where i lives ; the box was damaged and three items were laid around the torn box with another two items missing ; which i ordered five in total .
negative	it was a kind lady whom picked_up and with the label address and handed in ; no one at home during that time , she left it by the flowerpot and put a long note through the letterbox .
negative	it was sent by hdn , the address was on the label and , not the royal_mail .
negative	when i called the petsupermarket , the lady on the phone , denied that the package was sent by hdn , and she was insisted by royal_mail ; i was confused .
negative	clearly , it said on the label .
negative	she wanted me to take as many pictures as possible and send them to petsupermarket to proof that .
negative	i did not bother and haven_'_t got time for it .
negative	hi i ordered three things with you before christmas what a disaster .
negative	first the money for two things went out but was refunded then the one product that did go through was not ordered .
negative	as i had two refunds i rang up to check that the third item was being delivered as it was marked as dispatched .
negative	i was wrong .
negative	it was not dispatched so will have to wait to see if going to be refunded .
negative	would i use this site again don_'_t think so by this very very poor customer experience i had .
negative	made the mistake of buying a shower_tray from them .
negative	was needed urgently , was promised delivery next week .
negative	arrived 0_months later .
negative	in the meantime countless_emails , messages left and not replied to , delivery dates given but not adhered to , on one historic date pre and after sales sent 0 conflicting delivery dates - of course it did not arrive on either date .
negative	what you might save money wise originally you will lose on the project delays , having to get people back on site .
negative	we were lucky in that we ordered only one item , if you bought several things from them it could take you months to get the entire order .
negative	they are either completely disorganised or completely dishonest .
negative	their manager to whom everything is referred to for action , never rings back , hides behind the telephonist .
negative	they caused us a huge_amount of stress , and delayed our project so much that it delayed our house_move as well .
negative	have now had 0 couriers accept my delivery - one cancelled as they had underquoted - still_waiting refund on deposit - second one cancelled on day of collection no reason given .
negative	while i may get a refund of both deposits , it is simply a credit_note to be reused on shiply , not my money back .
negative	this is patently unfair - i didn_'_t cancel these jobs , just the cowboy couriers who were due to collect !
negative	shiply take the money and run the website but walk_away from the problems and leave it up to you to sort it out .
negative	this is the response from the advertising_standards authority who just walk_away like shiply - if you use shiply ever read every item on the website and be aware that the cowboy couriers who use their site can cancel your job at any time , walk_away , and it costs them nothing but it costs you bigtime .
negative	thank_you for contacting the advertising_standards authority .
negative	i understand you raised concerns that shiply . com was misleading because it was not clear from the front pages that shiply ’_s fee will be returned to a user ’_s account as time - limited credit if a job is cancelled .
negative	we can intervene if an advertisement seems likely to be in breach of the uk code of non - broadcast advertising by , among other things , being likely to provoke serious or widespread offence , risking causing significant harm or being materially misleading .
negative	we have assessed the case however we consider it unlikely such a breach has occurred in this instance .
negative	we noted that the full user agreement is available from every page on the website and also from the “ user faq ” section as part of the “ payment & service ” questions .
negative	we noted that in section six of the user agreement the advertiser makes clear that they charge a fee for their part if setting_up the service and that if a job is cancelled the fee is returned as credit which must be used within six_months .
negative	given that customers have to utilise the service online and the user agreement is available on the website , we do not consider it likely consumers will be mislead for the reason suggested .
negative	ordered and paid for various items on the 0th_april . had my order and accepted payment e_-_mails immediately .
negative	on 00th_april received an e_- mail refunding me with an amount relating to part of the order which was not available but no e_- mail from the seller explaining or apologising for this - my pet hate when online sites take your order and your money and then decide it is not available .
negative	if you do not have it - remove it from your site !!!
negative	00th_april - still no sign of the order so sent them an e_- mail asking for status update .
negative	no reply from them yet but order actually arrived on 00th_april .
negative	yes - you do get some good deals on this site but don_'_t bother if you are in a hurry !
negative	paid next_day delivery and my order came 0_days_later !!!
negative	when i asked for a refund for my payment for next_day delivery i was told no .
negative	ridiculous .
negative	will not be using again !
negative	!
negative	black and white tiles ordered for chequered effect in hallway .
negative	although advertised on - line and even on the packaging as being the same size the tiles actually differed by 0 - 0mm , thus_making a chequered effect ( as photographed on the website ) impossible !
negative	the company were accommodating in arranging_collection of the tiles fairly quickly , however over a week after they have been collected i am yet to receive a refund .
negative	i was also advised that a collection charge would be deducted from my refund which angers me as the tiles were faulty , not as advertised and i had no other option !
negative	never will i order from you again , the flowers were near enough dead , the delivery time i asked for never happened i said after 0 clock in the afternoon not 0 clock in the morning , i paid an extra 0pound for it to be an extra big bunch and had a small bunch arrive im not a happy customer , first time ive_ever ordered with you and the last .
negative	they sell you a faulty car and brush you off with repair dates and beats round the bush .
negative	to busy to hear your problems but not busy for sales avoid doncaster rude rip_off sales_staff whom hassle you to give them good stars .
negative	steve whom works there doesn_'_t have a clue about bmw and staff are real rude
negative	having_researched web for stools the lakeland website looked most professional , easy ordering system and relatively speedy delivery service for christmas .
negative	item packed very well but once opened to assemble discovered parts_missing from both stools !!
negative	lakeland unable to re deliver parts before christmas so total_waste of time for me and no spare seats for christmas , wish i had ordered from a company that actually checked what they pack .
negative	happy christmas ?
negative	?
negative	0 letters missing from my husbands van stickers and totally the wrong_colour no response to emails
negative	bought item then after a week was told not in stock .
negative	0weeks later still_waiting for my refund !!
negative	avoid id say !
negative	fine if lots of people have complaints and the case is gauranteed to be a winner otherwise you get dismissed .
negative	if the case looks like it might be a bit_tricky and might have to be worked at then they dont take it on .
negative	" we ' re here to help you get the compensation you deserve ".
negative	they say on the advert .
negative	i did not receive my order and when tracking through their website was told the order had been despatched .
negative	i tried four times by email and three_times by telephone to talk to customer service .
negative	not one email or anyone i spoke to could tell me what had happened to my order .
negative	i have now been waiting for 0_weeks .
negative	no sink_unit - no refund - no communication .
negative	i have used this company before but won_'_t ever again i ordered 0 bunches of flowers for elderly aunts for xmas .
negative	one lot arrived but the others didn_'_t .
negative	the money was taken from my card .
negative	now serenata say they don_'_t have any phone contact but deal will deal with problems by email , within an_hour .
negative	i have emailed them 0 times , over 0_days and got no response .
negative	appalling service .
negative	i now have to contact my credit_card company to get them to deal with this company .
negative	i won_'_t ever use them again and will tell all my friends and family not to
negative	not only did they sell ( via a phone_call ) a broadband package to an elderly_aunt who doesn_'_t own a computer , they wanted £_000 to cancel the contract once her relatives had realised the situation .
negative	we were forced to contact the ombudsman and the battle lasted for months , and although the cancellation_fee was waived , our aunt was still financially worse off as a result .
negative	they are totally indifferent to their customers .
negative	i applied for my loan - staff were friendly and accommodating when i was told i was approved .
negative	things went well until we got to arranging when i was going to get the loan ..
negative	i was then told that the funds wouldn_'_t be in my account until the following_monday !
negative	as i desperately_needed the cash to pay for medical prescriptions , i asked if i could have it earlier - this condition came with a £_00 advance ( for what ?
negative	admin ?
negative	penalties ?
negative	i '_m not sure ) leaving me £_00 short of the original loan i '_d applied for .
negative	i felt exploited at a time when i was feeling at my most vulnerable anyway .
negative	i vented my disappointment and thoughts about this transaction to the staff who had no opportunity to make this situation any better - i think i was swindled ...
negative	excuse me , you take a mistake on my name , please correct it , my name is chen , wen - chi
negative	i have been calling and emailing escapade and no one is getting back to me .
negative	i placed my order over a week_ago to be delivered last thursday - nothing ever came .
negative	i want my refund but no one is answering .
negative	unacceptable
negative	trying to get thru to them jokers are a waste of time .
negative	customer_services is terrible .

negative	we have wated 0weeks for our order we have been ordering with you for over a year and the cevice is getting worse . when we go for free delivery . we are not able to cary cat_litter so your firm was so good but find i can not rely_on it now . un happy
negative	not sure ft this is the post_office delivery error or bad packing .
negative	still_haven_'_t got the part but the phone operator was helpful and said would refund my payment .
negative	it has a silver_lining , having tried to make the drier work have found i need a different part .
negative	ordered drawers with 00 week lead time .
negative	didn_'_t turn_up within time took 00 weeks .
negative	when they turned_up they were very bradley damaged and can only have been dispatched in that condition .
negative	i then had to send photos to prove damage .
negative	took them 0_days to inform_me they would pick_up in three more weeks and also that the refund i requested have to ll this trouble would not be refunded until drawers picked_up and then i would have to wait another 00 working_days after that . not yet refunded as these are due for pick_up this week .

negative	unbelievable !
negative	dissappointed
negative	where do i begin ?
negative	i booked a hotel in san_francisco over the weekend with hotelsclick .
negative	i subsequently attempted to call up and speak to someone about my booking .
negative	for three_days i called every_single number listed at the bottom of their website , including for their_offices abroad .
negative	i never managed to get through to anyone , despite calling several_times throughout the morning and afternoon .
negative	i also called the hotel directly and they had no confirmation of my booking whatsoever , despite the money being taken from my account .
negative	the red warning lights were now flashing .
negative	i also emailed hotelsclick asking someone to call me , i have not received a reply nor a phone_call .
negative	i decided to cancel the booking which i was entitled to do since i was within the cancellation window .
negative	i have confirmation that the booking has_been cancelled but no refund has_been given , despite the faqs on the website stating that refunds are given the same day .
negative	my booking_reference is h0000 - 00000 .
negative	please can someone at hotelsclick contact me about my refund as a matter of urgency .
negative	please , please do not book with hotelsclick - i have never come_across a company like this that takes your money yet does not pick_up the phone or reply to emails .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from you hotelsclick .

negative	i was unhappy with my existing cleaning company so decided to give mopp a try .
negative	i used their very easy website to book my cleaner 00 days in_advance and almost_immediately , received confirmation from them .
negative	because i was having to leave a key out for the new cleaner , i was a bit_concerned_about the security side of things - would i have any comeback if i got home from work to find that the house had been cleared out and not cleaned ?
negative	- so i filled out their online form .
negative	0_days_later , i still hadn_'_t received a response so i called mopp .
negative	i spoke to a very helpful man and gave him my booking_reference .
negative	he confirmed that all of the cleaners are checked and have references but that they wouldn_'_t be allocating a cleaner to me until 00_hours before and they would send the details to me .
negative	he suggested that , once i had this information , i call them back and speak to them about me having the cleaners telephone_number .
negative	i agreed that that sounded fine and waited for my e_- mail with the cleaners details .
negative	i then received an e_- mail response reassuring me that , in the unlikely even that anything was to go missing , they have full contact details of all cleaners .
negative	to my horror , i then received an e_- mail i received 00_hours before the cleaner was due , was entitled " booking error " and went on to tell me that their new website had accepted postcodes in areas that they don_'_t yet cover so they couldn_'_t provide a cleaner for the next_day !
negative	i replied to their e_- mail with my feedback but haven_'_t yet had a response .
negative	my main question is , why on earth was this not checked when i called or when they replied to my e_- mail ?
negative	i have already cancelled my previous cleaning company and , working full time , i don_'_t always have time to do it myself .
negative	i have visitors arriving tomorrow night and am so cross that i am now going to have to spend tonight cleaning when i '_d give mopp 00 days notice to arrange a cleaner .
negative	i would recommend that you don_'_t bother with mopp as they are unreliable and so very frustrating .
negative	i '_m only giving them 0_star on this site because you cannot post a review with no stars !
negative	this company is only after your money - don_'_t use them at any cost !
negative	i ordered a birthday_present for my son & it won_'_t be here in time .
negative	the website say delivery is quick , yet i '_ve just been told it will take 0_weeks from date of order for a spin_bike to be delivered .
negative	when i asked to cancel the order they told me it would cost me £_00 !
negative	i enquired why and they said it had been despatched & delivery had been paid for .
negative	i asked where the item was and they said in their warehouse - they didn_'_t have a driver available for 0_weeks yet wouldn_'_t let_me cancel my order .
negative	don_'_t use this company - they will let you down !
negative	update to sports and leisure reply :
negative	i have contacted the consumer advice helpline and they have informed me that i do not have to pay this £_00 charge for 0 reasons ; .
negative	delivery was quoted as being free at point of order and to charge me £_00 delivery would suggest that the £_00 had been added onto the purchase price of the bike - this is not allowed .
negative	also under the distance_selling act i have the right to cancel my order without_incurring charges as the item is still in their warehouse and has not been delivered to me , also nowhere on the website or in our contract does it state cancellation charges will be applied if you cancel the order .
negative	they advised me to inform the company of this ( i have done ) and if they still refuse a full_refund they will assist me with contacting_trading_standards - something i fully_intend to do .
negative	i have now ordered my sons_birthday_present from [_external_reference_] and they have no problem delivering on time !
negative	update on reply : i '_ve now had an_email_telling_me that distance_selling act doesn_'_t apply to me " the 0 day money back guarantee does not apply in this instance as you have not received the item ."
negative	and they are now classing this as a " failed delivery " and charging me £_00 for this failed delivery - laughable when you consider i have to cancel because they refuse to deliver in time for my son '_s birthday .
negative	i was told that the bike is still in the warehouse as they have no drivers avaliable , yet this has now changed - apparently it '_s in a delivery van & will be spending the next week travelling around with the delivery driver before delivery - and it can '_t be cancelled .
negative	if you ' re thinking of pacing an order beware - apparently you can '_t cancel your order if the promised speedy delivery is actually 0_weeks - the email repsonse stated " the onus is on yourself to ensure that you read through any terms & conditions prior to placing an order " and yet nowhere does it say you can not cancel an order or that you will face a £_00 charge if you do ...... watch out for this company - don_'_t trust their website they seem skilled at taking your money ( over_£_000 of mine - i '_m still_awaiting any type of refund ) whilst providing nothing in return ......
negative	ordered from this website 00th_april was e_- mailed package had been despatched on 00th_april , expected within 0 - 0_days money has_been taken out of my account , e_- mailed them for more information had no reply only e_- mail from them was to leave a review .
negative	i have tried_ringing them 0 times only to be kept hanging on listening to awful music then dialing tone again then they cut you off , don_'_t suppose i will get a refund now , so my advise to every one out there is avoid using this site
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my order and its been 0weeks .
negative	the service is shocking
negative	flight cancelled due to air_traffic control strike in france .
negative	flight rebooked from a different airport 0_days_later .
negative	unable to get refund direct from car_park as had used_fhr .
negative	didn_'_t manage to get_hold of customer_services before alternative flight so rebooked with fhr in the hope that i could get a refund on my return .
negative	e_- mailed fhr asking if my original payment could be refunded got no reply so phoned them to be told they could not refund me as i had used the car_park , albeit for 0 hours , and i had not given 00_hours notice to cancel .
negative	i find this policy outrageous as i sat on a plane for 0 . 0 hours before being told that it was cancelled so was not in a position to give 00_hours notice or not use the car_park !
negative	extremely disappointed that they would not even consider a refund as a gesture of goodwill , particularly as i had rebooked with them from a different airport .
negative	they have shown themselves to be unable to deal with anything outwith the norm .
negative	lesson_learned and will definitely not use them again .
negative	i am rather disappointed as my first request was not delivered and the money credited .
negative	when i reordered the plant went to a different address than on the form .
negative	i have dealt_with your firm in the past and had good results , so this made it even worse .
negative	as i struggled through the door with three children ( 0 being in a car_seat ) and two under 0 , two men stood chatting away to each other .
negative	i had around £ 0000 to buy carpet for my stairs and bedrooms .
negative	i finally manage to get in and have a look around for 0 minutes clear in my mind what i was going to go for .
negative	i look towards the door and an older man and women are about to walk in .
negative	the to staff couldn_'_t get to the door quicker !
negative	speaking nicely to them and asking if they would like any help !
negative	seriously !
negative	because i have three children i must be poor right !
negative	well that was it .
negative	i decided not to spend my money there !
negative	i shouted how rude that was as i left and wrote a letter of complaint .
negative	they sent me a 00_% ( i think ) money off voucher .
negative	no apology , just money off .
negative	i would never shop in carpet right now or in the future .
negative	ordered the 0 rolls of wallpaper which i have this morning unwrapped ready to hang and both rolls have a recurring fault throughout the roll down the right - hand edge !
negative	it '_s too late to replace them as i have had to rearrange everything to make a window to decorate .
negative	i am not impressed !
negative	i am very disappointed with the delivery service placed an order , received an_email to advise me my order had been despatched on the 00th_april today is the 00rd_april and stil no sign of my order .
negative	very very disappointed .

negative	i recently started_using wowcher when i saw a great deal for a break away to find that i could not book for 0_days after i had paid and that the only time i could go was not available .
negative	i telephoned to ask if wowcher could assist in helping with availability however they quickly advised i had to call the merchant who said i then had to pay more money if i wanted the date advertised .
negative	i telephoned wowcher back who advised it was out of their control and if i wanted a refund i could have one .
negative	i said yes and the advisor said she would process the refund , i asked how long it would take to receive and she said within 0 working_days .
negative	i have just checked my bank_account and no refund .
negative	so i have called wowcher who are denying saying they would process the refund and it was up to me to request it ... correct me if i am wrong but the conversation clearly_states that i would like a refund and how long it would take to be received to which the rep answered , is this not classed_as requesting a refund .
negative	i have asked the rep to listen to the call which clearly says that i asked the rep to tell me when it would be issued !
negative	!
negative	i am awaiting a call back .
negative	however i will never use wowcher again , nor will i recommend them due to the poor service and when i you request a refund by telephone , letter or email you expect it to be sent !
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	i returned a pair of shoes 0_weeks_ago and still_havent received a refund .
negative	i had a curt email today saying refund refused but no reason_why .
negative	the shoes were sent back in their original packaging unworn .
negative	i have now asked paypal to investigate .
negative	this is the worst service i have ever received .
negative	i purchased 0 items for which i paid in full .
negative	i waited a week for my delivery then had to call their customer service only to be told that one of my items was not in stock .
negative	they didn_'_t bother to contact me even_though they had my contact information .
negative	i had to wait another week for 0 of my items .
negative	when my order arrived , i quickly realised that they had sent the wrong item which was half the price of the item i had ordered .
negative	i telephoned customer service only to be told that i had to return the item at my own_expense before they would dispatch the item i had paid for 0wks previously .
negative	i had to wait another week before finally receiving my item .
negative	i had to then telephone customer service a week_later to ask them to refund the postage i had paid .
negative	i finally received email from complete_care - a one line apology for the delay .
negative	shocking customer service .
negative	just wasted over an_hour of my life adding items to my shopping_cart only to find that when i went to complete order , my delivery slot had been taken .
negative	i am well aware of the 0 hour delivery slot hold time , but i was well within that .
negative	it would usually take me around the same time to choose these items in a shop , however this time my shopping_cart was deleted .
negative	this has happened to me before but i was willing to put it down to some sort of interupted internet_connection .
negative	i '_m pretty sure that i will not bother trying to do this again even_though i have been a loyal_customer of yours for the past 00 years .
negative	not happy .
negative	very hungry
negative	although the guernseys were nice , i would never use this company again , because of the major fault with their website concerning next_day delivery .
negative	i needed the jumpers the next_day and selected the express service on a friday around lunchtime .
negative	the woolovers website allows you to do this and you get charged full wack despite the fact that next_day service is not possible on a friday for a saturday delivery ( why ??).
negative	i only found this out when i went into their delivery policy when the goods didn_'_t arrive the next_day !!
negative	it '_s not stated when you pay and as woolovers knew full well that next_day delivery wasn_'_t possible ( but their customers don_'_t !
negative	), they should not have charged for such a service .
negative	every other website ( including my own ) flags up a message that you cannot select a service if it is not possible , or doesn_'_t let you select it in the first place , but not woolovers , they cheated me out of £ 0 . 00 delivery charge , which is tantamount to cheating their customers !
negative	they refused to refund the £ 0 . 00 postage or even part of it .
negative	eventually i got the goods 0_days_later !!!
negative	postage was supposed to be free for such a service , but they refused to refund my money .
negative	my advice , if you want next_day delivery for a weekend , don_'_t use woolovers !!!
negative	sorry , nice goods , rubbish service .
negative	flowers delivered on wednesday dropped by friday the same week ...
negative	so very disappointed !!!
negative	!
negative	i have wasted so much of my time trying to chase a parcel i have given up hope and decided to write a review instead .
negative	the service i have received is appalling .
negative	my package should have arrived yesterday , instead it is still sat in the shop where i dropped it off on tuesday .
negative	i paid_extra for a service to get it there on time yet it hasn_'_t even left the shop yet ?
negative	i have been in touch with you yesterday for most of the day to inform you that there were no tracking_details even online .
negative	you failed to get back to me with answers .
negative	today i found out the real reason is ups hadn_'_t even been booked as the package wasn_'_t scanned .
negative	so if i hadn_'_t of got in touch , my package would just be sat there ( even_though it still is sat there in the shop ) all your customer_services offer is " sorry " you haven_'_t once thought about the fact you '_ve messed me around and wasted the last 0_days trying to contact you and get some information out of you .
negative	you should be offering me an upgrade or a refund .
negative	instead you said you won_'_t give me a refund because its not your " company policy ".
negative	you have just sent me an_email to say you '_ll give me some money off my next package - are you having a laugh - do you really think i '_d want to use your services again ???
negative	i still don_'_t have the re - assurance from you that my package will leave the shop today .
negative	your customer service is pointless - there is no customer service !!!!!
negative	!
negative	paid virgin mobile for next_day delivery and yodel deliver it to the wrong_address and it has_been signed for , by the time i realise the company '_s call_centre had shut as for some silly reason they shut at 0pm even_though you can receive deliveries up until_0pm !!
negative	who is employed by a delivery company who can '_t get a flipping address correct , now i cant find my very expensive product .
negative	the call_centre when i did manage to speak to them briefly just fobbed me off and gave_me the van_drivers mobile number , now i guess its just because he wanted to go home , but the van_driver wont answer his ruddy phone , so they will be getting an earful on the phone first thing in the morning until something has happened .
negative	beware .... check their t &_cs very carefully before purchasing .
negative	due to a martial split , which has_been explained to them , i cannot go_ahead with all of my bathroom refurbishment .
negative	i asked them if they could sympathise with me and give me a refund given my extenuating circumstances and the fact i was moving into rented_accommodation .. nope - 0_days is the max !!!!
negative	fat chance !!!
negative	was offered a credit_note to buy accessories , how many could i buy for £_000 . 00 !!!!
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	do not touch this company with a barge_pole , the after sales_team are a joke .
negative	i have e_mailed them twice and got no response , it states it could take up to two working_days to reply to e_mails ( why ) .
negative	if no response within two_days phone them , what a waste of time and money , a could , nt run a pxxs up in a brewery springs to mind .
negative	they owe me approx_£_000 from a cancelled order , and i , m finding it extremely difficult to get reimbursed , it is looking like i am going to have to take them to the small claim court to retrieve my money .
negative	be warned stay well clear of this company , it , s like something out of fred karnos circus .
negative	enough said .
negative	how can this being left_behind a dustbin be a safe_place
negative	i ordered off the official uk ecco website . the boots arrivedpromptly and weere beautiful unfortunately they where too narrow for my calves . so i had to return them . there was no return_label in the box . th cheapest option to return them to sweden was £_00 !!!
negative	i nearly passed out in the post_office i will never order online again from ecco .
negative	i ordered a pack , and i payed for it , but i have not got it yet .
negative	absolute_joke of a company ... ordered £_00 worth of food for my boy cat who is on a special prescription_diet .
negative	within an_hour money was refunded though it took nearly three_days for the money to actually credit back to my account .
negative	having phoned for an explanation i spoke to two very rude staff_members who stated that pdol no_longer deliver to inverness scotland which is most certainly mainland_uk as it was too expensive though they always did up until recently so i find it difficult to believe they '_ve only just noticed the higher costs to themselves seen as they have been trading for years .
negative	having found the same product on ebay i ordered from pdol0000 but did not realise they are the same company and same thing happened only it took them four days to issue a refund through paypal which is now being held (£_00 ) and won_'_t be available to me until goodness_knows when .
negative	worst and most rude company i have ever dealt_with .
negative	i strongly_suggest you try petfleas . co . uk as they provided me with a first_class extremely quick service .
negative	shame on you pdol , don_'_t lie you don_'_t give a damn about animals all you care about is profit !
negative	just noticed a review from a customer in denmark , you can send to denmark but you can '_t send within your_own country , bunch of idiots !
negative	have had a credit account for two months and owe only £_00 .
negative	made first payment which was double the asked for minimum_amount .
negative	tried to place an order which was cancelled then tried again thinking it was just a glitch and again order cancelled .
negative	phoned a 00p_per_minute line only to be told my account is under review ... the lady explained that the company were looking in to my purchases and payment history and that i should attempt to place an order after my next statement which isn_'_t for another three_weeks !
negative	customer service agent then advised that i should pay for my order cash to which i replied " that kind of defeats the purpose of having a credit account doesn_'_t it ".
negative	this does not amuse me as i am trying to rebuild a dodgy teenage period of bad credit decisions .
negative	what an odd company i would not suggest anybody no matter_how utterly desperate you truly are and believe me i too was desperate but believe me i '_m not that desperate to be mucked about by a company who feed of the poorer in our society to line there own already fat pockets .
negative	i will happily go back to purchasing everything cash from the likes of eb * y , am ** on and pl **. com where at_least you don_'_t have to put up with utter_nonsense !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	! grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !
negative	very dissappointed with packaging for a 00 . 00 cap , wrapped only in a plastic_bag & forced through our letterbox .
negative	did wonders for the peak !!
negative	bought cheaper caps from other_sellers that were packaged in a box .
negative	nealry three_weeks and i still_haven_'_t received my order of one printed mug .
negative	no reply to emails or messages send through my online account .
negative	unacceptable service .
negative	will not order from or recomend them again .
negative	my husband and i booked parking with stress_free parking through a 0rd_party site ( fhr ).
negative	when i called on approach to the airport ( 00mins_away ) the woman i spoke to couldn_'_t find our booking .
negative	whilst this is not ideal , i understand that these things_happen occasionally .
negative	however her attitude_towards me was extremely rude .
negative	she was not in the office and didn_'_t have it written on her list so basically accused me of lying about the booking .
negative	when she got back to the office she did find the booking and said she would " try " get a driver to the airport to meet us .
negative	no acceptance of responsibility or apology - it was our fault for only booking the previous day ( despite getting an_email_confirmation from fhr ).
negative	we had to wait 00mins at the airport ( with no communication from stressfree_parking until the driver eventually arrived .
negative	the service was not great but it was the attitude and complete absence of customer service that was appaulling
negative	i never received my item , my money was taken and i never received what i paid for .
negative	after emailing beaty bay of my experience i still never_heard back from them .
negative	i ordered some flowers for our granny '_s 00nd_birthday .
negative	they weren_'_t delivered as there was ' a problem with the address '.
negative	despite having my contact number and the recipient '_s contact number , no one was called about the failed delivery .
negative	i emailed to complain and 0_days_later had no response .
negative	i had to call an 0000 number to complain .
negative	apparently their courier , yodel , didn_'_t inform them of the non - delivery .
negative	i got a refund in the end but it took several days and granny didn_'_t get any flowers for her_birthday .
negative	i will not use them again .
negative	0_months_ago i ordered products ( worth 00 gbp ).
negative	a few_days_later hairsupermaket wrote that my order had been dispatched , and after two_weeks they took my money .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my products , and they have only answered my first out of three e_-_mails , yet .
negative	the first response was very friendly , but so far that hasn_'_t done any difference .
negative	am i a fool to believe that there has just been a delay ?
negative	anette from denmark
negative	and in danish :
negative	for 0 måneder siden bestilte jeg produkter ( værdi 000 dkr .).
negative	få_dage_senere skrev hairsupermarket , at de havde behandlet min bestilling , og efter 0 uger trak de pengene fra min konto .
negative	jeg_har stadig_ikke modtaget mine produkter , og_de_har kun svaret på_den første af tre mails - ind til videre .
negative	det første svar var meget venligt , men ind til videre har det_ikke gjort nogen forskel .
negative	er_det tåbeligt af mig at tro , at der bare er tale om en forsinkelse ?
negative	you took my order and when it was due for dispatch told me it was out of stock so not sure why you ' re sending me this review ???
negative	?
negative	ordered a card for my brother - in - laws_00th_birthday and despite the confirmation that it had been sent 0_days prior to his_birthday , it still has not been delivered 00 days_later .
negative	usually 000_% reliable , but not this time !
negative	if you expect them to respond to you with any level of politeness you will be sorely_disappointed .
negative	not only have they ignored emails but they have failed to follow through on any of the actions that they stated they would take .
negative	they have also taken to ignoring our pleas to sort_out our flight details it takes them an average of a week to respond to each email and each email is usually followed up at 00 hour intervals .
negative	avoid this company at all costs .
negative	purchased a new contract over the phone on 00th_october .
negative	received phone the next_day on the completely incorrect contract costing_£ 0 more per_month !
negative	not what i ordered and not discussed on the phone at all , this was a unauthorised sale .
negative	called twice on 000 number trying to return phone , left holding for over 00_mins each time costing me money .
negative	had to request return details twice before they were emailed to me and have never come_across such bad don_'_t care type attitude from staff .
negative	don_'_t be tempted_by their cheap deals they don_'_t exist and are lies !
negative	the actual products i ordered for my party were completely fine and arrived promptly .
negative	my buying experience was good , however , i was talked into buying the ' sticky tack ' to adhere the banners etc i had purchased to the walls .
negative	this turned into a complete_nightmare .
negative	my kitchen has only just been decorated and the dark ' sticky tac ' is effectively very cheap , horrible blue tac .
negative	it just does not come off at all .
negative	i have resorted to using cream cleaner and a scourer to get the stuff off which has now completely_ruined my walls - my whole kitchen needs repainting .
negative	not happy at all and i will be complaining to partyrama
negative	i have used this site for many_years & haven_'_t had no_problems when it comes to delivery ... i placed a order on 00 / 00 / 00 ...& i '_m still_awaiting delivery .. i informed customer service i still_haven_'_t got my order , to be told to wait 00 days for delivery .,. its not rocket_science the order has_gone_missing as delivery from guernsey is 0_days max .... i am a loyal_customer but words_fail me from the lack of interest concerning customer service ...
negative	i was very dissapointed with lenstore .
negative	after ordering lenses for a halloween_party , and paying extra for fast delivery three_days_later i was informed via_email that the lenses were out of stock and would take 0 - 0_days to be in stock .
negative	resulting in me having no lenses to wear for the party .
negative	ridiculous !!
negative	!
negative	don_'_t_believe a word about getting your money back in 0 to 00 days of the item leaving you .
negative	they had my camera for 0_months but kept claiming it had not arrived at the right department yet !.
negative	in the end i looked up hong_kong trading standard laws and threatened them with their customs and excise who monitor this .
negative	amazing .
negative	camera found and refund on its way .
negative	they caused me so much stress and upset .
negative	£_000 . 00 is an awful_lot of money for me to lose .
negative	i ordered flowers a week in_advance for flowers to be delivered for a friend '_s birthday on may 00th .
negative	i had not heard from her so contacted her to see if she had received them on the monday and she had not .
negative	i sent three emails to iflorist chasing why the flowers were not delivered and asking why i was not informed .
negative	in reply i have received two emails stating that it will take 0 - 0_days to respond with an answer ??
negative	?
negative	i phoned on friday 00th to find out what was happening and a lady stated that she would refund the money i paid for the flowers as she could not get through to anyone in the international department .
negative	i said that is fine but i still would like an answer as to why my flowers were not delivered and why i was not informed - do they do this to everyone who orders internation flowers ??
negative	?
negative	she has escalated the issue to the international dept and i recieved another email later in the day from them to say it would take a further three_days to look into the matter .
negative	so to date , i have had no flowers , no refund or explanation !!!!
negative	!
negative	how many people do they do this to ???
negative	how may people follow_up on if their flowers have been delivered .
negative	how many people do they take money from and not deliver the goods ???
negative	?
negative	i have ordered via another trustworthy online company and at_least my friend has a gift .
negative	now it looks like i have to go through my credit_card to get my money back ....
negative	my experience of this company seems to reflect that of many others - incompetent service .
negative	the dx calling_card was left on the floor , under our gate on a particularly wet , windy day .
negative	the post box is on the gate with a clear sign post .
negative	to add_insult to injury , both my husband and i were at home and there is no_doubt at_least one of us would have heard the bell , if the driver had bothered to ring it .
negative	the only redelivery option in the week would have involved being at home between 0 and 0 , impossible due to work_commitments , so i was forced to pay £ 0 . 00 for delivery on saturday_morning .
negative	this was , in fact , delivery of my new passport which i was waiting for , although it was hardly helpful that i had no warning of the delivery .
negative	although i have received a response from the complaints_department , clearly none of their reminders to drivers have any impact , judging_by the number of serious complaints about their sloppy service .
negative	i have been left out of pocket due to their incompetence .
negative	more worryingly is the fact that the passport office has given the contract for their deliveries to such a consistently incompetent company .
negative	i am not sure how the star_rating is going to register but my star_rating is zero_stars
negative	i would like to begin this by stating that this review is written without prejudice and is not intended to cause objection or harm - financial or otherwise - to wowcher or any of it '_s affiliates , traders , vendors or customers .
negative	it will be not name or implicate by name any third_party .
negative	it is solely based on personal opinion and is written completely unbiased .
negative	i purchased a wowcher for a treatment that i desperately wanted and was really looking_forward to having but when i tried to redeem it using the contact details given i couldn_'_t get an answer .
negative	the most i tried was 00 times in one working day between office hours ( please disregard that statement if you want to but i have no motive to mislead and just a genuine intention of not letting others lose their hard earn '_t ) i contacted wowcher - they responded by forwarding an_email - still unable to get through to redeem my voucher i contacted customer_services again and was informed that i could only claim back 00_% of the amount i paid and that would be in wowcher credit ( if i understood correctly this credit also has a time limit ) i have been unable to redeem 0 vouchers before but it has not ended quite so expensively . i would also like to state that out of the vouchers purchased before we had a caravan break planned that was cancelled days before we were due to go away and a meal in london with friends that the restaurant cancelled a couple of hours before the reservation time !
negative	we were already in london and the restaurant was certainly not shut ( as they claimed ) when we walked past it earlier . i am not suggesting they were not being honest just stating our experience . we then had empty stomachs and in an attempt to still enjoy a meal we had promised ourselves had to pay elsewhere . that in itself is not wowchers fault but for me it should have been food for thought ..
negative	i am in no way suggesting that anyone_else uses my personal opinion as a deciding point on whether or not to trust this method of buying and i am in no way intending to slander or cost profit for any business involved in my personal experience . i would like to state however , that £_000 less in my bank_account and no successful deals to date says i personally resent doing so and regret not doing enough research . my conclusion is that i am only in control of spending the money , i have no control on whether a booking is taken or kept .
negative	never book with odopo !!
negative	they canceled my flights the day after i booked them and didnt even inform_me .
negative	they are now saying i am only entitled to a tax refind of 00 pounds which will cost 00 pounds to apply for .
negative	they are a scam !!!
negative	!
negative	delivery was late .
negative	parcel delayed for days .
negative	no response to any emails sent to customer_services .
negative	we had an order cancelled at 0 . 00 on sunday_night 00 / 00 / 00 so no other supermarkets were open so we had no shopping for the week .
negative	i put_together a letter and email it to them and i have still not had a reply from tesco letter below
negative	dear_sir or madam ,
negative	i am extremely annoyed about the way tesco has let us down .
negative	when you read what happened i am sure you will be just as horrified .
negative	i was going to write a letter of complaint to your chairman and send it by recorded delivery .
negative	after_speaking to my daughter i decided to email you first and give you the chance to restore my faith in tesco ’_s before taking the matter further .
negative	my daughter always orders the weekly_shop on line and we normally have it delivered between_0am and 0am on a saturday .
negative	this week my wife and i were away until sunday_afternoon so the shopping was ordered for between 0pm and 0pm on sunday .
negative	when there was still no sign of our shopping after 0pm on sunday my wife rang your helpdesk and spoke to darren a customer_services manager .
negative	instead of making matters better they were made much worse .
negative	my wife was told the order had been cancelled she asked why and by who but darren did not know .
negative	she was horrified .
negative	she was put on hold .
negative	darren came back and said the delivery vehicle had broken down .
negative	my wife asked the obvious question why no one had bothered informing us .
negative	the reply was i don_’_t know .
negative	my wife passed the phone to me i asked darren why you could not have used another vehicle .
negative	at that time on a sunday_night there must have been several vehicles parked up .
negative	darren cut me off and said i am telling you about the store .
negative	thinking i had got it wrong i said so the problem was with the store not the vehicle .
negative	darren said the problem was caused by a vehicle breakdown .
negative	i replied the question is still valid why you hadn_’_t used another vehicle .
negative	darren replied it was not just a vehicle you needed but also a driver .
negative	i pointed_out the obvious that you had a driver for the broken down vehicle .
negative	that driver could have driven one of the other vehicles .
negative	it became_obvious that darren was not helping the matter .
negative	darren then said the delivery could be rearranged .
negative	i pointed_out we urgently_needed milk and also bread and meat for three lots of sandwiches for the following_morning .
negative	i passed the phone back to my wife because she knew if and when she wanted the order to be delivered , darren then became very off hand and said .
negative	i want to talk to one person not two .
negative	well pardon me we are the ones that have been left without food on a sunday_night when all the supermarkets are closed .
negative	it must have been much worse to have to speak to two people .
negative	customers need to be able to rely_on you .
negative	i know the vehicle breakdown could not be helped , but you could have handled it so much_better .
negative	to just cancel the delivery without informing us i am sure you will agree it is totally_unacceptable .
negative	as i tried to point out to darren i am sure all your vehicles were not in use at 0pm on sunday .
negative	customer_services are supposed to at_least try to make things better darren made it much worse .
negative	as you know it is not what someone says but how they say it .
negative	my daughter has received an_email from you .
negative	no explanation of what went wrong or assuring us you will do your best to deliver our order if it ever happens again .
negative	not even a promise that in future you will bother to inform us if there is a problem .
negative	your email did contain a voucher for £ 0 off our next shop .
negative	we had used a £ 0 voucher off the order that you failed to deliver that is now lost .
negative	we also prepay the delivery charge .
negative	during the recent bad_weather you cancelled our order .
negative	we understood why even_though we managed to drive to the store in wrexham .
negative	it did not alter the fact that we lost out on the prepaid delivery twice .
negative	not a very good deal .
negative	can you imagine our horror finding out after 0pm on a sunday_night that your entire food order had been cancelled ?
negative	any other day of the week ok but sunday_night when all the supermarkets are closed .
negative	what were we supposed to do ?
negative	as i am sure you know a company ’_s reputation is hard won and very easily lost .
negative	people need to trust you to deliver what they order and deliver it on time .
negative	if they can ’_t trust you they will go elsewhere .
negative	i am hoping you can restore my faith in tesco ’_s , supply a valid explanation of what happened and reassure_me that if i continue to shop with you i will never be treated so badly again .
negative	if not i will be sending a copy of this email with a letter by recorded delivery to your chairman .
negative	on the 0th_april “ you and yours ” on bbc radio 0 broadcast a feature about why tesco price match is misleading .
negative	i am sure they will do a follow_up .
negative	if the follow_up feature mentions that customers also cannot trust you to deliver their order it will make customers think_twice about using your company .
negative	it ’_s up to you now you have the opportunity to put all of this right .
negative	i look_forward to hearing from you .
negative	regards
negative	ken smith
negative	a very angry ( and very probably ) ex customer
negative	i booked flight to spain for 0 of us and was told in an_email i would recieve flight reference within 00_hours , two_days_later still nothing so i call company who then go on to say because i need to use my wheel_chair they can '_t book extra assistance so i said cancel the assistance and go forward and book flights .
negative	i was then told i would have an_email_confirming flights within 0 minutes , two hours_later still nothing so i call again and was told they would try again with the process and i would be sent an_email with half an_hour .
negative	i did recieve an_email but not confirming my flights it was to say my flights had gone up in price so they would need to cancel .
negative	so i phoned again asking if my money would be refunded in due course and they said i would recieve another email_confirming this only the pending money on my bank card wont_be added straight_away it will take up to 0_days if not longer .
negative	i am so so so disgusted with this service .
negative	i will tell everyone i know whos booking a flight never to use this company its more trouble than its worth .
negative	after not replying to weeks worths of emails asking when my tickets would be delivered on the afternoon of the day of the paolo nutini gig , just a few hours before i was due to set off , i finally received a reply telling_me that in order to get my tickets i would have to meet the seller at the event venue .
negative	i was not local to the gig so was worried_about travelling all that way with no tickets so asked the website to get someone to ring me to try to find an easier solution .
negative	i was refused a phone_call and my requests of a refund were ignored as i was told again to meet the seller at the venue at the time of the event .
negative	i arrived at the right time and waited for around 00_minutes with no sign of the seller .
negative	luckily , others were there who had also been told to meet the same seller here to receive their tickets so we tried to contact the man who had arranged to meet us .
negative	he refused to come to us , but luckily the other people agreed to go to him to get the tickets ( despite the torrential_rain !)
negative	after waiting in the rain for over an_hour we reached the front of the queue to be told our tickets were fake .
negative	do not use viagogo !!
negative	!
negative	they are robbing scammers who should not be allowed to exist .
negative	we phoned them on two occasions to clarify whether we were allowed to check in luggage on our flight and whether it was included in the cost of our flight .
negative	the first person we spoke to said ' yes ' to both of these questions and that they would send email_confirmation .
negative	they didn_'_t so we phoned again .
negative	this time we were told that check in luggage was not included in the price we had paid and that we would have to pay £_00 at the airport to take luggage with us .
negative	she then told us that if we joined ' flyblue ' we would get one item of luggage checked in for free .
negative	we did this , then phoned air_france to check .
negative	turns_out this was also completely false .
negative	### response to comment below
negative	the booking confirmation has a column for baggage .
negative	this column is empty .
negative	this is why we felt it necessary to confirm with your customer service team , who gave_us the wrong information ... twice .
negative	these conversations took place on the phone as all the email responses we got were automated and didn_'_t answer our questions .
negative	holly
negative	the flowers were delivered and looked like they were already a week old and not value for money
negative	in my opinion this company are a joke .
negative	be warned they will take ages to answer your communications , make you wait for weeks before they deliver your goods and will not reply to you if you need to return items - apart_from to tell you not to contact them again as they are dealing_with it .
negative	i don_'_t think so !
negative	i would not recommend them to my worst_enemy !
negative	my experience with plumbnation has really put me off online shopping .
negative	i have never been treated so poorly by a company before , the communication was disgraceful and the delivery of my order didn_'_t ever arrive , they wouldn_'_t give me a refund and ignored my emails and calls .
negative	luckily i paid through paypal and had to make a claim with them to eventually get my refund a month later !
negative	i didn_'_t receive an_apology from she active either , especially for the time spent chasing them for a refund and order i didn_'_t receive and it was entirely their fault .
negative	she active should be reported to the standards of fair_trading .
negative	i have informed everyone i know , not to use them and hope that others who read this heed my advicey .
negative	i also hope she active try to comprehend what ' good ' customer service actually involves .
negative	i am absolutely appauled by their service .
negative	specified for delivery on mother '_s day , as they offered .
negative	flowers were delivered saturday , however nobody was around to recieve them , as obv we were expecting them on sunday !
negative	so sunday came , no flowers , how very embarassing , and disappointing for my mother , when they did arrive they were already bloomed & starting to die .
negative	i contacted customer service who ignored my emails , until they recieved 0 emails from me theye eventually replied .
negative	the reply was rude , & with numerous grammatical errors .
negative	they refused me a refund because i used a voucher_code ( which they gave_me when i received flowers from them ).
negative	i suggest they dont give customers voucher_codes if they dont want to accept them !
negative	i would never use them again , too expensive for the few flowers you get , and very poor delivery service !!
negative	!
negative	on my consultation they told me i was a great person to get laser_eye_surgery , she said i had a option of lasik and lasek but they recommended lasik .
negative	i booked my surgery and off i went and waited 0_weeks .
negative	on my surgery day , the surgeon told me my cornea in my right eye was too thin and i will never be able to have lasik or lasek_surgery and i should come_back in a couple of years to get the contact_lens placement .
negative	i was extremely upset and went to optical_express to see what they would say .
negative	they said i can get either lasik or lasek and i went for lasik , they said that optimax lied to me and they just didn_'_t have the technology like we do .
negative	i was very angry and upset because the surgeron told me i could never have laser_eye_surgery and i would of respected him more if he told me they just didn_'_t have the technology .
negative	optimax also didn_'_t tell me i had a lazy eye which is bad because the risks are higher when having_laser_eye_surgery with a lazy eye .
negative	i now have had my eyes_lasered and i can see very well .
negative	optical_express is more_expensive but the care and aftercare is amazing .
negative	terrible customer service .
negative	i had bought a £_000 set of 0 phones and they had a 0 year_warranty .
negative	all phone_calls go to a voicemail system , so you can '_t speak to a real_person .
negative	online repair form filled in and returned and i was called back , being promised a freepost_envelope for the non - working item 0 year into the warranty .
negative	nothing .
negative	i called back leaving a message for a supervisor to call me back .
negative	nothing .
negative	i called them and left them a message_saying i had been promised a return envelope , that no - one had called me back , that their telephone communication and email communication was terrible and could they call me back and resolve things .
negative	nothing .
negative	i called and told them i would be reporting them to trading_standards .
negative	i then called siemens who answered_immediately , have given me a call reference , and will be sending out a freepost_envelope .
negative	my dress arrived defective & the customer service phone line 00000000000 has_been busy all day .
negative	no outfit for my birthday / halloween_party , very disappointed :(
negative	i like to think i '_m a pretty savvy internet shopper -- how wrong can you be ?
negative	ordered a phone on 00 / 00 / 00 which was advertised as 0 - 0 working day delivery , so 0 working_days would have been 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	today is 00 / 00 / 00 and still_waiting .
negative	i '_ve tried_calling several_times and just end up hearing " your call will be answered shortly ", their email ' service ' advertises a reply in 0 business days ( really ?
negative	it would be quicker to use the postal service , if they ' re based in the uk , which having read the reviews on here , they ' re not -- they ' re in hong_kong ).
negative	i '_ve already asked my credit_card firm to enter a dispute as i '_m strongly suspecting i '_ve been stung .
negative	truthfully , don_'_t gamble with this firm -- i wish i hadn_'_t .
negative	=== update 00 / 00 / 00 ===
negative	so the package has arrived , already opened !
negative	the security seal on the box , which says " do not accept if security seal is broken " is broken -- the box is sealed inside a clear plastic_bag but i can easily see the seal has_been split , and not just a little_bit but all the way .
negative	this phone could be second_hand for all i know but i '_m not going to open the bag to find out , it '_s straight on its way back for a refund .
negative	the text on the box is all in polish and there is some sort of uk to 0 - pin adapter just thrown in the bag , implying that the power_cable is a 0 - pin and i '_m supposed to use an_adapter to be able to plug it in !
negative	incredibly poor , waited nearly 0_weeks for this and now got to wait however long for them to process the return .
negative	like i said : do yourself a favour and buy it from amazon instead .
negative	i ordered a back gammon set on thursday the 00rd and paid for next_day delivery .
negative	i did not receive my goods until the following week on tuesday the 00th .
negative	i see no point in offering a next_day delivery if u are not going to honour it .
negative	i would never have paid the amount of delivery charge had i known the company was incompetent !
negative	very disappointed and will not be using the company again .
negative	i purchased an i phone 0c from cpw , they made a mistake when they first connected me and didn_'_t activate the contract so i couldn_'_t use the phone properly .
negative	i went back into the store and two hours_later had another contract , they assured me they had cancelled the initial contract .
negative	i now have two bills from ee one for a contract i never used .
negative	it has_been a huge hastle trying to sort this out ee are refusing to cancel the contract and say i need to go to cpw .
negative	avoid at all costs , very unimpressed !
negative	they say that there are seats available at a specific price , but then try to charge you three_times as much .
negative	never book with them !
negative	complete mess , courier couldn_'_t be bothered to deliver my parcel .
negative	neither courier or parcel0go wanted to listen to my complaint .
negative	kept getting passed between the two .
negative	avoid
negative	when confirming order and paying the postage was reset so that the item would not get to me in time .
negative	unable to get an answer on the phone helpline .
negative	email response simply told me it was too late to do anything about it .
negative	therefore i received an item too late to be of use .
negative	i then asked to be removed from the database and my account closed .
negative	this has not been done as i have received this email asking me to rate my experience and hoping i have been happy with my recent order !
negative	waste of my time .
negative	the first posting is correct ( only wish i '_d found it before i ordered ) i spent £_00 on phonecase , they sent a confirmation , this was over 0_weeks_ago .. everytime i contact them to find out where it is , they give me same ref that takes me to tracking co in hongkong .. however no trace of it in uk ...& no tracking to find ... tthey will no_longer answer me & will not refund me ... i paid by debitcard so no way of claiming back . avoid !!
negative	!
negative	i placed an order with interparcel for a package to be sent to spain on 0th_december and the parcel was duly collected by a dpd courier the following_day .
negative	i tracked the parcel online and saw that it was out for delivery on the 00th , then again on the 00th and finally a message was posted at 0pm on the 00th stating there was a query with the address .
negative	on monday_00rd after noticing this comment , i called at 0 . 00am and confirmed that the address details were correct and confirmed the recipients contact number , which was missing the last digit .
negative	on the 00th , when there was no further update on the tracking_system and the parcel still had not been received , i attempted to call interparcel again ( their website stated they were open till midday ) and just continuously got an answer machine message_saying the office would reopen after the august bank_holiday (??).
negative	in desperation i called dpd direct and after 0 attempts finally spoke with someone with whom i confirmed the address and contact number again and was guaranteed the recipient would be called and delivery would be arranged .
negative	on the 00th , the tracking_system was once again updated stating that they were unable to deliver the parcel ( but having contacted the recipient i knew for a fact that they hadn_'_t yet called her or attempted a delivery !)
negative	i tried to call them on the 00st and the 0st to find out what was going on , but both_times i just got an answer machine message .
negative	on the 0nd i finally got through to be told that the parcel was being returned to me because i hadn_'_t confirmed the telephone_number in time for them to contact the recipient .
negative	as this was blatantly untrue , and i had the telephone records to prove it , i quite understandably was not amused , but had no choice but to accept that the parcel was now on its way back to me .
negative	on the 0rd , the tracking_system showed that it had been received in birmingham .
negative	when i hadn_'_t received it by the 00th , i contacted both dpd and interparcel who confirmed that it was now at interparcels depot in crawley ( having passed my house in the process !)
negative	and it would be with me on monday 00th .
negative	on tuesday 00th , when it still hadn_'_t been received , i called and have been promised it will be with me on thursday 00th .
negative	so i wait with baited breath !!
negative	!
negative	and to add_insult to injury , after having to endure such poor service and incompetent customer support , i have been told that i will not receive a refund for the original cost of the service !
negative	i needed to get 0 parcels to london by a definite date in early_december and chose to use collect_+ as the recipient was at work all day and it was far more convenient for him to pick the parcels up at a local shop after work than it was to try to get to the post_office during the opening_hours .
negative	i dropped the parcels at my local collect_+ shop and they scanned without a problem .
negative	using online tracking i could see that the parcels were picked_up the following_day and the recipient received a txt notifying him that the parcels were on their way .
negative	00hrs_later when the parcels hadn_'_t been received and the tracking status hadn_'_t changed i called connect_+ and was told there was a problem scanning one of the parcels , but that they were at the depot and would be delivered within 00_hrs .
negative	00hrs came and went and as the recipient had now gone on holiday for 0_weeks , i called collect_+ and i asked for the parcels to be returned to me and asked for a refund of the shipping_costs i had already paid .
negative	i was told that i could have a credit towards a future order .
negative	obviously i had no_intention of ever using connect_+ again so i said that wasn_'_t acceptable .
negative	after keeping_me on hold for 0 mins they then told me i could make a claim for a refund and send me a claim_form .
negative	i waited another 0_days for the parcels to be returned to me , but still didn_'_t receive anything .
negative	finally , i called connect_+ again and this time was told that my parcels had gone_missing and couldn_'_t be found at the depot and was emailed another 0 claim forms .
negative	when i said i would rather wait for the parcels to be located even if it took longer , i was told it was highly unlikely they would turn_up as they had probably been stolen !
negative	!
negative	the whole_process was unprofessional , badly managed and a complete_waste of my time and money .
negative	the level of compensation is in no way adequate to cover the value of the contents or their replacement .
negative	i will never use this service again and after_reading the many reviews on this site , wish i had never used them in the first place .
negative	the delivery of your order 000000000 was unsuccessful as the driver was unable to access the property .
negative	failed delivery
negative	hello jennifer ,
negative	we chauffeured marialee '_s flowers to address removed today , but luck just wasn_'_t on our side : failed delivery
negative	what_happens now ?
negative	we ' re pressing all the buttons to ensure that the order reaches address removed as soon as possible , so please listen out for a call from us .
negative	if you prefer , you can use our contact form .
neutral	i had been told that the parcel was to arrive by the friday .
neutral	however , only on tracking the parcel it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	my daughter was extremely disappointed as it contained things from home that were slightly spoilt by the extra time taken .
neutral	the parcel was eventually delivered on the monday .
neutral	i felt let_down .
neutral	the excuse was import clearance which apprarently is out of tge or ups '_s control .
neutral	very disappointed as i was told it would be there by friday .
neutral	i ordered four_pairs of pyjamas , only three arrived .
neutral	contacted customer service , who may i add were very helpful , to be told they would send out the missing pair .
neutral	received a refund into my account the day after , no pyjamas as of yet , so presume they '_ve refunded without telling_me ?
neutral	nice one !
neutral	not !
neutral	i ordered style ' osan ' in white and was surprised that this shoe is certainly not white , but more of a light pebble colour , although the photographs clearly show a normal white leather .
neutral	i happen to like what i received and have kept them , but am still in need of a truely white pair of shoes .
neutral	in fact the other colours available in this style are strangely named as red alert & emerald , neither of which bare any relation to to the photographed colours which are much softer than their names suggest .
neutral	i wont_be ordering of them again as i ordered the wrong_size and when trying tyo send back they said they dont do returns the mad thing is i had to order the right size so they could have picked the wrong one up when they dropped the new one off at no cost to them .
neutral	i '_d have to go to a private dispatcher and it would have cost 000 to send back an 00_quid matress madness dont use them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	! 00
neutral	loved the choice & quality of items .
neutral	however they sent the wrong item .
neutral	i have returned it to be exchanged but i haven_'_t had any commutation from a & a to say they have received it or are sending a replacement .
neutral	disappointed that i will have to chase it up .
neutral	even more disappointed they processed a refund when the item is still available .
neutral	i have decided it '_s too much hassle to bother re - ordering .
neutral	:(
neutral	order placed for two items - one arrived promptly , but no communication about the other .
neutral	i have used this company before with mixed outcomes and would go elsewhere if i could find an_alternative , economic source of a wide_range of lamps .
neutral	the perfume was ordered on 00 march and arrived on 0 april .
neutral	ok it was easter inbetween , but it was available in local_stores at the same price , so nothing was actually gained by buying online , this time .
neutral	in the past thoiugh the service has_been quicker , and the products a little cheaper .
neutral	was very disappointed the flowers displayed looked lovely but when they finally arrived they looked as if the day had been to much for them they didn_'_t arrive until the evening so that didn_'_t help matters these were ordered well in_advance 0 / 0 / 00 unfortunately they looked like a last_minute decision and for £_00 spend a great disappointment all_round
neutral	first time i had used this company for chocolate products .
neutral	i had a very last_minute wedding order to complete and chose the next_day delivery option which was obviously more_expensive .
neutral	the couriers did not deliver next_day which put me a day behind on all orders which was frustrating .
neutral	i e_mailed the company to let them know my frustrations but no reply was received .
neutral	when the product eventually arrived it was packed very well and the cigarellos were almost intact
neutral	i requested sunflowers but there was not one in the bouquet and the greeting_card to say who they were from was for some else entirely .
neutral	i had to ring portugal to find out whether any flowers had arrived as i had not heard which spoilt the suprise they were supposed to have been and confused the recipient who had no idea who had sent them .
neutral	they will now charge you £ 0 . 00 if you exchange less_than £ 0000 .
neutral	hi , although i have only good comments regarding the quality of the hire care i would have liked to have had an itemised bill at the end of the hire .
neutral	i found the print out provided rather difficult to understand as it includes estimated charges on the bottom line .
neutral	ok but doesn_'_t quite live up to what you wpuld hope for .
neutral	had qualified for a free gift , it was in my basket , however somehow lost it on checkout .
neutral	when i contacted cheap_smells they refused to honour gift .
neutral	the delivery if my pan was very quick and it was well_packed but the pan coating was damaged .
neutral	i ended_up driving to the procook shop in braintree where it was replaced .
neutral	should have saved_myself the postage and gone there instead
neutral	we had a hard time getting answers when we asked questions .
neutral	the order took several days to complete .
neutral	never was notified that the shipment was picked_up or that the payment went through .
neutral	never received an invoice .
neutral	not sure if the order is correct or if the shipment will arrive in a timely_manner .
neutral	so far it is one week late but not sure whose fault that is .
neutral	i will not have any option on the workmanship or quality of items until they arrive .
neutral	not a bad_experience , just a little complicated .
neutral	despite living 0 minutes away from a good tyre_centre , and being_able to drive my car on the " run flat ", i decided to use e_- tyres and pay a little extra .
neutral	both my husband and i work , and we have a young baby , so it was the easier option ; so it appeared .
neutral	my husband made the booking online , and asked for an afternoon fitting due to working nights .
neutral	i received the confirmation phone_call the next_day in the morning , and the e_- tyres member of staff said that the tyre couldn_'_t be done that afternoon .
neutral	it was agreed the tyre would be fitted the day after , but in the morning .
neutral	that day i received the confirmation phone_call , only to be told that this time only the afternoon fitting was available .
neutral	after 0 phone_calls to more than 0 member of their staff , it was agreed that the tyre would be fitted without me being present - not ideal !
neutral	for complaining , and for inconvenience , i got a discount .....
neutral	£ 0 . 00 !!
neutral	the tyre was fitted_perfectly , and i am very pleased , but in future i would drive to my local tyre_centre and not have the aggravation .
neutral	massive shame !
neutral	was very pleased with the overall cost of x 0 blinds .
neutral	had them fitted by experienced tradesman yesterday .
neutral	however i would like the kitchen blind pelmet to be 00mm larger this was the 000cm width x 000cm drop
neutral	also we had to cut the bedroom blind by 00mm
neutral	also i would like the bottom runner of the blinds to have a neat stopper on the some what ugly circle cross holes ....
neutral	hopefully blinds to go will send another pelmet correct_size and neat stoppers for the bottom of the blinds ?
neutral	the print quality is not really a good quality .
neutral	some pages you can see pixelated noise whereas all my pictures are high resolution .
neutral	some pictures in certain pages were in a darker shade than the actual pictures .
neutral	and some of the pages are good .
neutral	arrived quickly and the courier service was efficient although my instructions to deliver to neighbour were ignored .
neutral	i was pleased with item but little care was given to the way it was packaged for such an expensive purchase .
neutral	items collected had been left out in the rain with the consequence that we had a soaking_wet boot in the car .
neutral	there is a covered area available which would have made the transaction more customer friendly .
neutral	unfortunately i arrived to pick_up my car at gatwick_airport when the normal pick - up place had apparently been flooded out .
neutral	things went badly wrong from there on ...
neutral	there was almost no information about where to go except to the other terminal .
neutral	then i spent 00_minutes trying to find the correct place .
neutral	eventually i did find the desk , but the staff were clearly also having a bad time and gave_me incorrect information about where to find and car and what assistance to expect .
neutral	the whole operation took one hour and twenty_minutes before i drove_away - in the meantime not only was i half crazed with frustration , but i had missed the appointment for which i was picking_up the car .
neutral	i have to say that on returning the car all went very speedily and smoothly .
neutral	i understand that it was an unfortunate occasion due to the flooding , but it was clearly badly handled .
neutral	on returning the car all went very smoothly i '_m pleased to say .
neutral	the car was fine although not as clean as it needed to be to allow me to check for any bumps and scratches .
neutral	good service but had to wait much longer for my specs than_expected .
neutral	it should be clearer on the website - i eas expecting specs in 00 working_days of ordering them , why does it take so long ?
neutral	ok so i '_m not that irate but it did say to write a catchy headline !
neutral	love the concept of this site .
neutral	had a hiccup when i booked the 0nd time that the driver never turned_up .
neutral	not ideal when at the airport and a tube_strike is on !
neutral	perhaps you could send sms_messages with a number to call with issues , booking_reference_number , etc .
neutral	so a support_team could dispatch another driver if this happened .
neutral	i appreciated receiving a £_00 credit ( that i never used ) due to the frustration .
neutral	i also downloaded the app but never tried it so deleted it - the web app is far easier to use and see so don_'_t think i need the app .
neutral	keep_up the good work and advertise !
neutral	i only found you by googling and have been promoting your service despite the hiccup i first experienced .
neutral	i placed an order at 0pm on a monday with 0 . 00 next_day delivery ... but it wasn_'_t delivered the next_day .
neutral	there was an issue in that i received an_email that my order was dispatched and i had to be home to sign it on wednesday .
neutral	i chose my home address because i thought it could have been easily slipped through the letter_box .
neutral	now it was going to be delivered at home when i was at work .
neutral	i would have given my work address had i known a signature was required .
neutral	when i rang to sort this out , i was told that it was very clear in the ordering process ( in the price drop - down when selecting the delivery option ) at the timing .
neutral	i have double - checked again now and it '_s not true .
neutral	there '_s standard , next_day , next_day by 00pm and next_day by 00 .
neutral	if you cannot fulfill next_day then don_'_t offer it alongside of the specific 00am & 00pm next_day options .
neutral	i had to ask for a refund of the delivery cost but with some friction with zoe on the other end of the line .
neutral	she rang back to tell me that there was in fact an issue with the courier and she would refund my delivery fee ( and ended_up refunding the total price ).
neutral	it was all a big frustration in preparation for a trip so i needed the goods delivered in time to the right place .
neutral	far too much effort was put in and the delivery timelines when ordering are not clear .
neutral	however , i appreciated zoe sorting me out , and calling me back to close the feedback & service loop .
neutral	i will order again from festive_lights if there is a product i require .
neutral	sincere thank_you for making good on my initially poor experience .
neutral	the product was great .
neutral	would have been better to know that you use a ' signature_required ' mail delivery before the order is placed ( apologies if i missed that !).
neutral	the parcel was delivered to my home , then i asked it to be redelivered to my local post_office .
neutral	i was out of town for 00 days so had more hiccups when trying to collect it and had it redelivered again to the local post_office .
neutral	luckily the driver didn_'_t read the instructions and i worked at home today which allowed me to answer the door when the postman rang the bell .
neutral	the strap itself is genuine leather and high_gloss , high_quality .
neutral	i really wish it came with new pins and a tool or instructions how to put it together .
neutral	it '_s not rocket_science but when you want something to be completely nice and new , you want everything to be nice and new - including the inner working pins .
neutral	especially for a 00_quid price_tag !
neutral	all in all , my watch now looks brand_new with it '_s new band and i am pleased but it sure took_ages to get here and then some frustration putting it together which i could have done without .
neutral	it cost us £_00 00p online if we paid on the night it would have cost us which it was on the card we got for the room it was £_00 00 p . so we wont_be staying at your hotel again i dont accept the terms but i have to tick because it wont send
neutral	i sent an_email to your customer_services regarding an order , that i had placed that afternoon .
neutral	what i got in return was a half page in some foreign_language , possibly swedish .
neutral	i emailed them again requesting that they replied in english , as i do not speak foreign languages .
neutral	the next reply was in german , i think , but was no better .
neutral	it was very frustrating , not to have my concern resolved .
neutral	.
neutral	i ended_up phoning and a very nice young_man hopefully sorted my concerns out .
neutral	we shall see .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	for i have not as yet received my order .
neutral	was not given the option to have same day delivery even_though advertised .
neutral	so no one was home to receive them they were left at back of house and got wind / cold damaged .
neutral	application process was good and fairly swift .
neutral	however , the lady_who called to verify my details was extremely difficult to understand .
neutral	her english wasn_'_t good at all and i therefore missed most of what she was saying .
neutral	i sent 0 emails requesting a rollover which wasn_'_t responded to or even a standard ' we are dealing_with your request and will get back to you ' response .
neutral	i managed to pay off my loan in full before the due date but haven_'_t received a formal receipt for this or confirmation by email .
neutral	i have had to do a ' print screen ' from my member page for my proof of record of payment in full .
neutral	i haven_'_t experienced the actual pickup yet but i can rate my experience of booking so far .
neutral	my fault for not checking more carefully , but sms confirmation at £ 0 . 00 and cancellation_cover at £ 0 . 00 are automatically_added on and this is not made clear at the payment stage .
neutral	not very happy i '_ve been charged nearly_£ 0 extra when i didn_'_t need these things .
neutral	main_thing i love about cams is the chat_hosts an the friends i have met on there
neutral	i think bingocams is a great conception and it '_s a great site .
neutral	the ch make the games enjoyable and are great .
neutral	they involve everyone in the room .
neutral	there is a clique with some players and they can be quite hostile to anyone different winning !
neutral	!
neutral	the ch soon nip that in the bud though !!
neutral	the only_downside is that there are too many of the same winners / jp winners and if you don_'_t play all day every day you have very little chance of winning big .
neutral	a lot of the promotions are geared up for those who can play in the evening and there is very little incentive for the morning / daytime players to play .
neutral	was a little disappointed with the flowers that my partner received , they didn_'_t really look much like the description on the website and i didn_'_t feel i got very good value for money .
neutral	i ordered a watch for my fiance as a wedding present to give him on our_wedding day .
neutral	i ordered it in plenty of time to ensure i could have it engraved and any links taken out if needed however 0_days before the wedding i still did not have it !
neutral	the delivery company ups had " attempted " delivery several_times but could not find the road , they never contacted me to clarify how to find it so if i hadn_'_t contacted nightgear i wouldn_'_t have received it on time !
neutral	otherwise very happy with the watch and the price i got it for !
neutral	the stock in aldi is good and so are prices .
neutral	sadly , i often find i need to visit tesco afterwards as the stock is hit and miss .
neutral	the wine and jam are great value .
neutral	i didn_'_t order until gone 0 paid more than the item .
neutral	expecting delivery by the end of next_day .
neutral	was disappointed that it arrived the following_day i would of paid the cheaper postage had i known and waited a couple of days .
neutral	prices are significant_savings_compared to other_websites , but delivery is very slow .
neutral	i would expect much_faster delivery for ordering online .
neutral	i ordered some flowers and a baby_boy balloon as a surprise for my sister who had given birth to my nephew .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time but no balloon .
neutral	i emailed customer_services to find out why and was told that the balloon was out of stock .
neutral	i should not have been allowed to order the balloon if out of stock and perhaps should have been given an option to choose an_alternative .
neutral	i am receiving a refund but felt let_down as it spoilt the surprise of the moment .
neutral	i bought a few items .
neutral	reasonable_prices .
neutral	all items were not included but invoiced for .
neutral	when i enquired via_email , i received a very curt reply without an_apology .
neutral	probably_wouldn_'_t use again .
neutral	i dont_know yet as ive just filled in my form i would like to rate and share opinion when things_happen .
neutral	all good apart_from the long wait on the phone to be connected .
neutral	i purchased flowers for my daughters_birthday a while ago and was thrilled with them , so i decided to order some more for my friend who has_been poorley , i decided to go a little more_expensive and was so dissapointed at the lack of flowers , colour and arrangement , when i saw them next to other_peoples flowers i might have well gone to aldi and purchashed a lot more colourful flowers .
neutral	parcel not received on time after paying premium postal rate !
neutral	not happy .
neutral	now have to return item as arrived too late .
neutral	i love the idea and the ease and simplicity and the food was delievered quickly and it makes_sense , however wont continue as didnt find the soups or meals tasty and so demotivating .
neutral	has persuaded me that i should cook portions for myself and freeze them , then i will have the system with food i want to eat
neutral	okay guys , ordered what i thought was the absolutely cutest pirate_outfit ever !
neutral	when i bought it i thought the whole_thing would come , hat , dress , boots etc cause thy all tied in together .
neutral	so excited for it to come in the mail and all i get is the dress ?!
neutral	went on the website and can '_t even buy the hat at all !
neutral	without it , it looks like a witch_costume :( they should at_least say on the website ' accessories not included '.
neutral	so upset and looking everywhere for a cute hat that ties in with the outfit now that '_s not too dear :(
neutral	i thought i would buy this for my husband , for christmas ... i found the procedure confusing , in fact i think i paid for something twice .... i specified for it to be dated 00th_dec .... of which it is dated .
neutral	but !....
neutral	he received an_email !....
neutral	so he knows !.....
neutral	then to cap it off , i went into a shop , which sold unusual_gifts .
neutral	i found a beautiful display tin , with exactly the same product , for only £_00 . 00 !
neutral	whereas , yours came in a brown envelope ... so i feel really disappointed .
neutral	i was really pleased with how the website worked and quick delivery but 0 of the orders i placed were let_down by the delivery .
neutral	the arrangements were damaged and one was delivered and practically thrown at the person the wrong way up .
neutral	very pleased with customer service support with dimension information and drawings prior to delivery .
neutral	had confirmed delivery date however this did not happen .
neutral	one piece off the house was damaged have requested replacement .
neutral	i bought a dell_laptop as i '_d had good experiences with dell in the workplace .
neutral	took_forever to arrive and impossible to track effectively - seemed to be lost for weeks .
neutral	all the names and contacts i was given were never to be heard of again .
neutral	their info was out of date , the delivery company had moved their base 0 years before and told dell many_times , but dell kept giving me the old address .
neutral	spent hours and hours on phone lines , being cut_off , told garbage , etc .
neutral	warning : dell assumes you have internet access , which i didn_'_t have till i got the laptop !
neutral	!
neutral	bread is best around , some fruit and veg good .
neutral	not good on veggie food .
neutral	recent shelf rearrangement has_been a pain , no logic to it , just wasting my time .
neutral	prewrapped cheese is a rip - off compared to the cheeses counter .
neutral	often have good deals on alcohol , but i don_'_t drink much .
neutral	cafe is handy , some branches better_than others .
neutral	they have at last managed to stop the fresh coffee overflowing the cups but he flavour is not as good as it was .
neutral	great strong bags - especially the ones with apples on them - bring more please !
neutral	you lost out badly on the time the fire alarms went and i had to go outside , then you unloaded my trolley .
neutral	i had a broken arm at the time and it had taken half the morning to load it .
neutral	quality of the coffee in your cafe has dropped dramatically , but you still stock some of the best ground_coffee around .
neutral	( your mocha limu is fantastic !)
neutral	don_'_t like having coin operated small trolleys while the big ones don_'_t need a coin .
neutral	????
neutral	?
neutral	most of all your queues after 00pm with only one check - out operator working ( edinburgh jewel )
neutral	your veggie options are good right now - please don_'_t withdraw them .
neutral	know you can '_t maybe solve it , but why do you attract massive customers with trolleys laden with junk food and huge loaves of bread ?
neutral	the online experience is fine but i went into your camden store to try on some costumes .
neutral	basically , there was no where near as much variety compared to what was available online .
neutral	in fact , there was nothing comparable within the store to what i eventually bought .
neutral	given i was effectively buying blind online ( ie , not seen the costume in person nor given the opportunity to try different_sizes ) it would have been great to see some more images of the costumes than just the regular run of the mill marketing picture on the costume package .
neutral	just bought some glasses i can get better in sainsbury '_s for half the price thought they would be better quality as you lose you post and packaging on returns its not great .
neutral	all food items i have had , have been great .
neutral	the pandora order was so slow it was painful confusing and over a month how long does it take to send out an order and they charge 0 . 00 for even small items .
neutral	i have loved the fry_pan excellent but garlic press awful ../
neutral	depends what you but and don_'_t expect any thing fast really slow
neutral	we have ordered ' save the date card magnet ' and overall items received was mostly okay .
neutral	however , a few of the magnets are slightly dirty as it seems it been stack on one on another while the ink is not dry .
neutral	hence magnets have black_ink scrap over and looks dirty , meaning we won_'_t be able to use those that are scrap .
neutral	luckily we bought some extra so there was not some major problem of shortage , still , we would of expect perfect on every_single one of them .
neutral	another issues where we found was unnecessary was the cost of postage .
neutral	it cost free to uk but cost £_00 to post to denmark .
neutral	i chose it to be sent to my mother '_s house as she live in uk instead of paying £_00 .
neutral	once arrived , item was in a huge box where only a quarter of the space in box that was used for items .
neutral	it was unnecessary_packaging as it only cost £ 0 for my mother to post it over to me in denmark , unscratch .
neutral	maybe they should choose another courier system as the one they using is way too expensive and there is no need for it .
neutral	overall service is okay .
neutral	although not sure if i would return for my invitation_cards in the future .
neutral	i thought this car_park had number_plate recognition , maybe it does but i didn_'_t understand the entry system fully and just pressed for a ticket .
neutral	upon departure i tried to use the ticket to get out and it said i owed £_00 : 00 and i therefore removed the ticket .
neutral	after a few telephone_calls i managed to with the help of staff get myself out of the car_park .
neutral	i suppose it was dark on leaving and i couldn_'_t see the telephone button on the machine .
neutral	i have used other airport_parking_facilities and they just issued me with a ticket as i approached the barrier .
neutral	my ref_number was n0000
neutral	bought them as part of groupon - expected service to be a little_slow due to the amount of orders , but did not expect to see items listed as in stock when they weren_'_t , and not to be informed that they weren_'_t until i took it upon myself to call .
neutral	they sent my boyfs pair to the wrong_address , so generally not happy with the service as probably wasn_'_t even much_cheaper_than elsewhere
neutral	unfortunately there were problems with delivery by the carrier , calberson , but the shower doors and parois were fine once we managed to get_hold of them .
neutral	on the plus_side , hudson reed '_s customer service was excellent and calberson were finally quite charming
neutral	i experienced a couple of problems with the checkout_process .
neutral	it wasn_'_t particularly user_friendly and i had to hunt_around for the shopping_basket .
neutral	there seems to be no link to get back to it once you have added an item .
neutral	i clicked through from an_email offering a discount but it was very confusing as to how this would be applied and it appeared that the discount hadn_'_t been applied until the last moment .
neutral	therefore the whole_process took too long .
neutral	another problem that i encountered was a caching issue part way through and i couldn_'_t seem to clear thebasket .
neutral	i had to logout , and then start again .
neutral	received phone_call from company following posting of job on rated people . com .
neutral	they were able to do the job with little notice and the engineer came within the two hour_window i was given and completed the job quickly ( i can '_t comment on quality as it was just a service , but we haven_'_t had any_problems ).
neutral	however , i was unaware that the quote did not include_vat so a £_00 bill turned into an £_00 bill .
neutral	it is a complex system , and most of my payments ended_up being ' declined ' .
neutral	it takes months to go through , but then if it gets to 0_months , you lose it !
neutral	its a lot of work for what turns_out to be only a small refund , but if you have nothing better to do with your time , give it a go !
neutral	this item arrived damaged , unfortunately , by the time we spotted it we were at the point of ' no return ' and now will have to live with it .
neutral	where the hinges on the top pull down cupboard are attached , a screw has caused the panel to split .
neutral	- instead of the four screws required for each hinge - there is only two .
neutral	this may be because of the splitting - it is my guess that this should not have passed quality control .
neutral	also , when the the sink was placed on top of the fit was poor and it was very wobbly .
neutral	there was nowhere to attach the plug and the plastic piece ( which should not have been plastic in my view ) arrived broken and looked cheap and nasty and the unit looked better without it .
neutral	we currently having a lot of work done at the moment and did not inspect it thoroughly - lesson_learnt .
neutral	on the plus_side it looks great and ( if it was not damaged ) good value for money .
neutral	had to send both_pairs of glasses back twice as there were faults with both the frames and the fitting of the lenses .
neutral	have since had a full_refund .
neutral	ordered on internet and received within_0days was made aware of every_step of item ..
neutral	when i received the outfits , i tried mine on straight_away , it fitted really well and was just as_described , only to find out when i took it off the stitching had come away from the skirt and top bit of the outfit , i hadn_'_t got enough time to return it so i have ended_up stitching it back together myself in order to wear it ..
neutral	order some unlicenced mite killing product which was sent swiftly .
neutral	emailed regarding use / dosage / reapplication on bantams and no reply came .
neutral	i understand reluctance on part of seller but if they will sell it , advice should be forthcoming .
neutral	the service is always fast and extremely efficient .
neutral	however i am disappointed with the delivery people who don_'_t even bother to knock and just leave the delivery outside my front_door .
neutral	my last order was extremely heavy and i am disabled and need them to bring it inside for me .
neutral	i only saw it when i went out to see my neighbour , i had to leave to box outside in the pouring_rain until my family could come over later that evening to lift it in for me .
neutral	by then then box and contents were soaked and some of the bags of litter ruined .
neutral	perhaps you should review your delivery company .
neutral	rescheduled delivery day - waited all day not on time - had to ring julesb to chase - they apologised delivered after weekend 00_mins late on delivery window .
neutral	product great but delivery not great .
neutral	dog kibble was sent rather_than puppy_food however they were quick to recognise and correct once i contacted them , would still use again .
neutral	win ... bought a gel_nail kit ... it '_s brilliant .
neutral	draw ... bought some leggings ... quality was ok but not impressive to say the least .
neutral	lose ... have raised a case due to non delivery of a purchase ... one week on & i '_m still_awaiting a resolution .
neutral	unfortunately two of the flowers stems were broken .
neutral	they were for a gift
neutral	came in good time
neutral	i buy stuff from these_folks a bit , and they do well .. but when i emailed regarding pricing on the new festool pdc drill i wanted , the trail went cold after one inconclusive reply .
neutral	i emailed them twice more .. they did not respond .
neutral	i , eventually bought the drill from axminster_tools ..
neutral	so , if you just want to buy , then fine , help to buy is a little_bit harder to find .
neutral	i ordered a genuine janome_sewing foot .
neutral	the price was the same as advertised by janome but with free_postage .
neutral	the item arrived promptly but i was disappointed to discover that it was a universal foot rather_than the janome foot i ordered .
neutral	i rang gur the gentleman i spoke was very helpful and apologised for the error saying he would investigate why the error had occurred .
neutral	i returned the item and was sent a refund by return of post .
neutral	everything went_smoothly .
neutral	but ...
neutral	but : the ticket prices printed in the tickets and also at the stadium cashier were just half of that i paid to the viagogo plus service fee ( delivery by email ).
neutral	in that way i paid about 000_euros for the tickets , that were worth 000_euros !
neutral	be careful , somewhere_else you could find the same tickets and save a big money !
neutral	when i rung the store they were very good and tracked it down but it '_s still not arrived .
neutral	the staff are really good though excellent device and try to help as quickly as they can .
neutral	they need to use a different delivery company .
neutral	a lot of the retailers are far too slow to pay out , also others have not tracked .
neutral	after_placing my order and receiving my order confirmation_email i sat back and waited .
neutral	after 0 working_days i telephoned for information and after a tussle with the stacking system i was told that the computers were playing up but that he would look into it and get back to me .
neutral	after another 0_days i rang again and spoke to someone_else who was brilliant .
neutral	he looked into it , told me that one of my items was out of stock and therefore the order was on hold until it could all be delivered together .
neutral	when i pointed_out that my dog couldn_'_t wait that long for her meals he , at my suggestion , split the order in 0 , sent me a confirmation_email of what we had spoken about , and sent the dog_food out so that i received it the next_day .
neutral	the out of stock item would follow .
neutral	that too has now been delivered .
neutral	my gripe is communication or lack of it .
neutral	if you had emailed and told me of the delay i could have allowed for it .
neutral	i will try pet_supermarket once more and hope that the experience was a one off
neutral	i recd my order quickly .
neutral	however , the packing wasn_'_t good .
neutral	i ordered corn meal , pepperidge farm stuffing mix , jiffy corn bread mix and several cans of pumpkin pie filling .
neutral	the soft items were put in first , then the heavy cans were put on top .
neutral	stuffing mix was open and all over bottom of box , the stuffing crushed and unusable .
neutral	the corn meal lid was crushed partially and some had leaked out .
neutral	all of these things should have been put in on top of canned goods .
neutral	please pack better so there are not ruined items .
neutral	you are charging a lot for these items , please pack properly !
neutral	!
neutral	we are very satisfied with the table and chairs we ordered but i am afraid the delivery team need some lessons on being polite , they were very abrupt and i realise they are on a tight_schedule but a few manners go a long way .
neutral	smooth process , and parcel collected from home so saved a trip to post_office .
neutral	whole_process from placing order to payment took less_than a week .
neutral	however , some of the items were rejected which was disappointing e . g .
neutral	a dvd that was only watched once got rejected for not working .
neutral	and unfortunately i '_ve got to take their_word for it as it won_'_t be returned to me :-(
neutral	on the whole though it was a smooth easy process .
neutral	r shown on the web is different to the product that i received both_times .
neutral	first one managed to find someone_else to purchase it have just returned 0nd item for exchange so need to wait and see what_happens .
neutral	i ordered a new battery for my computer on line .
neutral	delivery was efficient i was pleased to have a text_message . however the battery was the wrong one .
neutral	i found it hard to contact you by telephone .
neutral	i tried to organise a return on line but found the web_site did not recognise my name or reference_number .
neutral	when i did get through on phone , your employee was very helpful .
neutral	i was advised to use the phonenext time to re order to avoid mistakes .
neutral	however the phone line is always busy
neutral	the wrong bettery was collected efficiently .
neutral	please could you make it easier to exchange items that are the same make but you require a different size and or colour - was a bit of a pain to be refunded and then to re order the item i required for a family_members gift
neutral	it took me several_attempts before the process was completed .
neutral	i was timed out twice !
neutral	then the after i paid twice the system kept saying an_error has occurred but i was determined to succeed .
neutral	despite the bother information on the site was good and very easy to follow .
neutral	i spent over_£_000 with tile_mountain ordering everything from tiles , beads , adhesive and grey grout for my bathroom .
neutral	i was massively impressed when the order arrived next_day and was all there .
neutral	possibly a fault of my own that i decided to change the colour of my grout from the grey i had bought to white instead .
neutral	i was a little disgruntled that i had to pay a £_00 delivery charge for the new white grout but am not unreasonable and can understand .
neutral	i also had to pay for the new grout £_00 wach and would get a refund when they received tge grey back .
neutral	however , the fact that i then had responsibility of returning the unwanted grout myself really annoyed me and has left me out of pocket .
neutral	i . e taking 0 large bags of heavy grout to the post_office and paying to return it !
neutral	i felt they should have collected the unwanted grout either when they dropped the new off or on a different occasion .
neutral	i have learnt a lesson to just buy this sort of product from a department_store like b_& q where i could have easily taken it back and swapped it at no expense .
neutral	my best friend has to lie face down for a week or more following eye_surgery so i sent her some flowers .
neutral	in my mind i had an image of a graceful bouquet full of scented lilies , roses and other gently coloured flowers .
neutral	i chose to allow the florist to make the selection - there was no room for instruction as to colour but i did request a large bouquet .
neutral	it arrived on time but i was disappointed by it being screaming yellow with an odd mixture of sunflowers and yellow lilies with one over large lily taking central place in the bouquet .
neutral	it did not seem large to me - i can '_t imagine what small might have been like .
neutral	i was rather disappointed but realise that sending flowers means you are in the hands of the local_florist - and of course american autumn flowers may be different from ours .
neutral	i just thought it was a raucous colour - but in the circumstances certainly eye_catching - literally and metaphorically .
neutral	flowers were organised with a message , and arrived promptly , and the recipient is very pleased with them .
neutral	however , the message that i included in the order wasn_'_t with the flowers , so they had no idea who the bouquet was from !
neutral	i don_'_t like having to write to someone , asking if they '_ve received their present - it makes me feel_uncomfortable .
neutral	but that '_s what i '_ve had to do .
neutral	so , i '_d give serenataflowers an average review - could do better !
neutral	i expected a better quality of print for the price i had to pay , delivery was slow and they didnt communicate with me , i had to chase them up .
neutral	fast dlivery pleasant to talk and deal with
neutral	found the website easy , and ordering easy .
neutral	unfortunately no acknowledgement of payment and estimated delivery time .
neutral	so i was left_wondering_whether i would received the goods or not .
neutral	i did 0_days_later and everything was fine
neutral	having ordered kit with 0 different printed designs there was some_confusion .
neutral	clothes to order was very slow in getting the second design back from the digitiser and the customer service rep was attempting to suggest it was me that caused the delay which was not the case .
neutral	they did eventually accept_responsibility though and refunded my speedy postage_costs .
neutral	the gear was nice quality , just a shame it didn_'_t arrive when it was promised .
neutral	i bought goods which were delivered some 0_days_later , but not as ordered .
neutral	the company made good the deficiency in the order , but again , waited 0_days for receipt .
neutral	in my opinion efficiency needs to imrove .
neutral	however the bag elastic snapped the second time i used it so now no sac , which kind of defeats things .
neutral	i was pleased at the quick service and accuracy of my prescription .
neutral	however , when i tried my glasses on for the first time , the frames were wonky .
neutral	i called customer_services who were very apologetic and promptly emailed me a return_label , but it is disappointing that the glasses were not checked in quality control before being dispatched .
neutral	i saw the the most beautiful and unusual flowers that i gifted for a work_colleague to cheer_her up .
neutral	they were very beautiful but they were delivered at 0pm , far too late , would have been nicer if it was earlier in the day
neutral	hi , im_sorry ive not yet recieved my items so i cant_comment yet
neutral	what a nuisance having 0 small packets of tablets in a much too large box .
neutral	if i had been out this would not have gone_through the letter_box and i would have had to go to town to collect .
neutral	if that had been the case i might just as well have gone out to the local pharmacey .
neutral	what about a jiffy_bag or long narrow box ?
neutral	the concept of rentify is great , and just what i was looking for .
neutral	apart_from restriction on the wording i would have liked to use , it was easy to upload property details / photos , etc_., and to be able to have this service free is great .
neutral	however , i had no interest in the property for the first week or two , so i then purchased the £_00 . 00 upgrade to include advertising on rightmove and unlimited credit_checks and referencing checks for 0 years .
neutral	the rightmove upgrade was worth it ( worth £_00 . 00 ), but the additional expense for the credit / reference checks was not worth it .
neutral	i did not feel that the customer service was great - it took rentify a relatively long time to respond to my email queries , and then did not respond to all queries , and i had to chase on several_occasions .
neutral	when i spoke to people on the telephone they were always polite and helpful , but often said they would call back with an update , and didn_'_t do so .
neutral	when we did find a suitable_tenant we then had delays getting the checks done .
neutral	despite having stressed to rentify personnel on a number of occasions that i needed the reference checks quickly , as i was concerned i would either lose the tenants , or lose a full weeks rent if they couldn_'_t move in on a specific date .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive the updates promised , and would have to chase each day .
neutral	they finally sent the reference after one of my chasers , only to discover that they '_d actually received it 0 hours previously .
neutral	i was therefore disappointed with the final service received from rentify , especially given that i '_d paid for the additional service / complete package .
neutral	but overall it '_s a good concept and i managed to find tenants after a few_weeks , and only lost a day or two rent due to the delay in obtaining references .
neutral	de_kwaliteit is niet super , maar_de_kwaliteit / prijsverhouding is prima .
neutral	als_je niet teveel geld kwijt wilt dan is dit een goede optie , waar je toch jaren plezier van kan hebben
neutral	the parking and transfer to the airport was ok with friendly bus_drivers .
neutral	the disappointment was that the car was not washed as paid for before_departure .
neutral	i did get refunded the cost of the car wash after a few phone_calls .
neutral	also i had to wait a little_longer_than i expected for the car to arrive at the airport when i paid the extra £_00 to have it taken over to me .
neutral	i ordered a pair of aigle clogs size 0 . 0 for my son and they arrived promptly .
neutral	unfortunately they were far too narrow and he couldn_'_t get them on ( he is a size 0 ).
neutral	i have a pair of size 0 aigle_wellies and the clogs were tighter than them !
neutral	so i returned them - have not yet had a refund but am hopeful that this will be dealt_with soon .
neutral	from ordering to receiving trolley very immpresive .
neutral	the speed control is very difficult to use on the move , some times one click can alter the speed by 0 or three 0 numbers , and some times the wrong way , so it may either lurch forward or stop
neutral	. not very immpresive .
neutral	hispek & electric shop one and the same with different prices and delivery arrangements .
neutral	phoned both on a monday & hispek said item was in stock and could be delivered to the postcode on wednesday .
neutral	on wednesday was phoned to arrange delivery on friday !
neutral	the man said he was in the delivery department and didn_'_t know anything about a wednesday delivery , didn_'_t have the correct phone no .
neutral	for delivery destination ( it was on the order ).
neutral	when phoning customer_services was told he was actually in sales !
neutral	customer_services guaranteed to look into the mix_up and contact me - needless to say did not !
neutral	i will not be using either shop again as all the confusion was completely unnecessary and incorrect information given .
neutral	the item itself does what it says on the tin .
neutral	on ordering before , it came through the post very quickly , but this time i ran_out .
neutral	so was dishearted somewhat .
neutral	happy with the fast delivery and verybeasy to order but flowers were not at all what they looked like online .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	£_00 flowers were more like a £ 0 bunch from tesco .
neutral	i bought 0 bunches and spent £_00 so really wasn_'_t happy and feel like i wasted my money
neutral	easy to do the ordering , i like how you get notified of delivery and kept up to speed , however , the delivery wasn_'_t great ... sent some to my mum and the box was literally chucked over her fence into back garden ... and my friend didn_'_t receive hers till gone 0pm which i thought was far too late , no wouldn_'_t appreciate someone knocking on my door at that time , kids in bed etc .
neutral	also , the 0 different ones i ordered don_'_t look like the pic shown on website ... i know they take a few_days to open up though so maybe will look as nice then =)
neutral	i received the excellent clock puzzle very quickly after my initial order .
neutral	was delighted with the quality of it and can '_t wait to see my grandson learning with it .
neutral	a subsequent offer arrived in my email , which included a 00_% reduction if purchasing a further eight puzzles .
neutral	i decided to accept the offer , but was disappointed that the 00_% reduction was not made as promised during the checkout_process .
neutral	didn_'_t risk paying full price of around £_00 , for fear of not getting the refund at a later date .
neutral	i repeat my assessment of the very good quality of there products , but feel a little conned by the follow - up sales attempt ..
neutral	product is great and arrived quickly ... once the order went through .
neutral	i uploaded my picture and proceeded through the process , continuing to paypal and paying for shopping ... waited for order to arrive but ... nothing !
neutral	emailed to hear that my order hasn_'_t gone_through .
neutral	no mention if this throughout the process .
neutral	three_times this happened before order finally went through !
neutral	i would say though that customer_services get back promptly and are polite and answer fully .
neutral	the product looks good too .
neutral	i am a little disappointed that the ticket i purchased was double the original price .
neutral	i won_'_t be using websites such as this anymore .
neutral	waited over three_weeks for part of my order .
neutral	e_- mailed twice , only one answered .
neutral	i ended_up having to phone to sort_out the problem .
neutral	they did not keep in contact to say they were waiting on the product coming in .
neutral	i was a bit disappointed and would think_twice before i use this company again .
neutral	i have very mixed_feelings regarding this company .
neutral	on the one hand ; the food was generally good , although the sausages were very bland .
neutral	on the other ; their customer service was the worst i have experienced in a long time .
neutral	when i placed the order , it was meant to come with a free ' naked rub ', but this did not arrive .
neutral	no problem , i thought , mistakes_happen .
neutral	so i called to let them know and request a replacement .
neutral	i was told that they could not send a replacement , as they only had large packing boxes , and was offered a refund of 00p as this was the price of the product .
neutral	however , the rub was advertised as costing 0 . 00 !
neutral	after a number of emails , in which i was condescended to quite badly , it turned_out that i had been lied to in the first_instance .
neutral	they eventually refunded 00p , as this was the price of the rub minus 00_%_off , and refused to acknowledge my complaints about their cs .
neutral	i know it seems silly to be bothered by such a small item and at first i thought the same , but by the time i had suffered through their customer_services , i was quite irate !
neutral	they were , however , very quick to refund for the low quality sausages , so i am grateful for that , and the rest of the food was very nice .
neutral	i paid for someone to lay a concrete base and erect the shed for me .
neutral	the finished_product is sufficient for shed storage but the metal material is flimsy , the closed shed doors vibrate backwards and forwards in the wind and the metal trim on the edge of the roof do not extend the full_length but in two sections so not ideal .
neutral	these do not overlap easily so hope this will not rust .
neutral	when i first found goggles for you , i thought that '_s great a nice pair of glasses at a good price , order online saves me going into_town to pick the frames , good value for money .... then the down_fall i waited two and a half weeks for them to be delivered ..
neutral	nothing i then spoke to an online rep who said the would be delivered in the next week ...
neutral	still nothing ..
neutral	it '_s been nearly a month ..
neutral	when are they going to arrive ..?
neutral	we '_ve ordered a lot of times through mine and my partners account .
neutral	on 0 separate_occasions the website fell over so despite trying for over 00_minutes each time we gave up and ordered from eat .
neutral	we '_ve also found they add a £ 0 delivery charge on some restaurants , but if you went on the restaurants own website and ordered through there delivery is free for the same order value .
neutral	will keep ordering but remain cautious !
neutral	the delivery was late , not left in the place requested and the ice_blocks had melted .
neutral	no response from company when emailed .
neutral	good range of clothing , and an ok customer service .
neutral	ive ordered a few_times_now , and the prices are very good , and th first delivery was very fast , but it seems to take over a week now , i have had to ring up to ask where my parcel was after one week to be told they would try to get it out the next_day , if i hadn_'_t rang goodness_knows when it would have arrived .
neutral	not very good when you need the items .
neutral	so yes the items are fine but delivery times lets it down .
neutral	so i am giving four_stars because of delivery .
neutral	the drink was just what i was after at a reasonable_price .
neutral	the let_down was the delivery .
neutral	as it was packaged in a box which fully identified its contents i felt that was risky .
neutral	at the time of delivery i was not home , so a cardboard_box , saying drink_shop all over it was left on the exposed doorstep .
neutral	lucky for me that it did not rain or anyone walking past didn_'_t think their christmas had arrived early .
neutral	this unsafe delivery method would put me off ordering again
neutral	when i first came upon this site , i really liked it as i thought i was getting honest_opinions of shopping sites .
neutral	i even posted a couple of reviews of companies i had bought from and after_reading comments about companies i was thinking of buying from changed my mind about them and tried another company which had good reviews .
neutral	so far so good .
neutral	that is until i bought furniture from oakfurnitureland . co . uk and received below_par furniture , i posted a review which was removed , i received an_email from trustpilot asking me to verify i actually had dealings with the company as the company could not verify i was a customer from the information on the trustpilot website .
neutral	i sent trustpilot my receipt to prove i was a genuine customer but almost two_weeks_later my review is still not showing .
neutral	on scrolling down the reviews of this company i noticed they had excellent reviews but a lot of reviews had been removed and were being investigated , i assume they were giving negative_feedback like myself .
neutral	what is the point of ths site if the company who gives bad service or sells rubbish stuff can get the reviews removed ?
neutral	starting to think this might not be a site i can_trust .
neutral	availability was good & item was exactly_what i wanted , however the shipping was quite slow & i would have liked a faster option
neutral	order came 0_days after_placing it , none of the numerous voucher_codes i had worked , including the ones medic_animal sent to me themselves . found a company ( viovet ) who are lots cheaper and deliver first thing the day after_placing order for free .
neutral	the cost of the postage was more than the cost of what i bought .
neutral	i would not have purchased in this way had i not had a voucher to cover the cost of the articles and the postage .
neutral	fantastic range on website and generally good customer service .
neutral	however , on one occasion , returned an item which surfdome claimed not to have received - very disappointing .
neutral	i was surprised to see the plant had about three flowers only .
neutral	it may well bloom dramatically with time , but that '_s one of the things we haven_'_t got .
neutral	the photo on the computer showed a full , colourful flowering plant .
neutral	otherwise the delivery was fine , but the internet site should be more realistic to avoid_disappointment .
neutral	i had the kerela chicken and found it had too much liquid .
neutral	the taste was nice , very mild , and it is so easy to use .
neutral	ideal for the store cupboard as an emergancy .
neutral	heaviest piece of furniture put in the wrong room and handles were a real pain to put on .
neutral	needed to drill from behind to allow screw to reach through to the other side .
neutral	i ordered flowers for my daughter on her 00th_birthday as she has never received a bouquet of flowers before .
neutral	they arrived while we were out but when she opened the box i was disappointed in the quantity of flowers .
neutral	i would have received more and in a better presented bouquet from tesco_finest .
neutral	we are now in the day following delivery and the roses are drooped and dead .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	service very fast , communication excellent , good range of frames , but ... when i first received my glasses , the arms were obviously faulty - they flared outwards at an alarming angle , making the glasses far too wide for any normal human head , including mine .
neutral	we all make_mistakes ; they were returned and , in the interests of fairness , i waited_until they had been rectified before writing a review .
neutral	however , i have now got them back - one arm is now at the correct angle and feels secure , the other still flares somewhat , is not properly secured , and it '_s obvious that no one checked them properly before returning them to me .
neutral	i only wear them occasionally when not using contacts , am about to go on holiday , just know there '_ll be a loooong queue at the post_office , and know when i '_m beaten , so have given up ...
neutral	i ordered this particular bunch of flowers for my mothers_00th_birthday .
neutral	she_loves roses and purple .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time and were well_presented .
neutral	the colours and arrangement were lovely .
neutral	i only have two complaints ...
neutral	the roses , on the second day , have already started to brown at the edges of some petals .
neutral	secondly , i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for a bigger ' bunch '.
neutral	for the price i was expecting more .
neutral	i '_m a little disappointed to be honest , but , my mother was very happy .
neutral	ordering my oil online with ' boiler_juice ' was easy and convenient , but the company that actually delivered my oil didn_'_t inform_me the day before as requested , so that i could unlock the tank and when the driver came , some people were putting new windows in my house , otherwise i wouldn_'_t have been home , i thought that he was quite miserable and unhelpful .
neutral	had very good dealings with this company in the past - delivery always on time !
neutral	however , the size of the packages has_gone down from 00kg to 00kg but the price has_gone up !
neutral	very disappointed with this and i am now looking for another company to purchase from !
neutral	i love the tiles they were exactly_what i wanted , they were great value and have transformed my bathroom .
neutral	however the delivery service was very poor i have a fairly narrow pathway up to my backdoor which i am convinced the driver could have managed to manoeuver along but instead he left the pallet of tiles in my front_garden .
neutral	i asked him if he could help me in with them and he told me he wasn_'_t allowed to lift anything because of health and safety , this may be true but his attitude was very poor .
neutral	i had to carry 00sq metres of tiles in by myself i am 00 years old and 0ft_tall .
neutral	we ordered some bedroom units in the " january " sale - we expected to have to wait for them to be made but they were delivered within the proposed time and we are very pleased with what we ordered .
neutral	one niggle - we were told by the salesman that they only had one sale per year and that we were getting a bargain !
neutral	a bargain ?
neutral	yes - probably but they appear to have a sale every_month !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i am still_waiting on my one direction_tickets for june the 0rd at murrayfield i need these tickets this is on my little girls birthday please_please don_'_t do this i know others who hav already got there tickets from this site a refund is not an option i am going to hav one very disappointed birthday_girl and also we paid a very lot of money for these please_please try and hurry things along please
neutral	as above
neutral	should have been better getting them from a market
neutral	i didn_'_t like the material of two of the dresses .
neutral	they were thick material although summer looking dresses .
neutral	they were a bit smaller han the average size 00 dress .
neutral	i ordered a dualit_toaster which was delivered very quickly ( within 0_days ).
neutral	unfortunately , after a few uses , it became_apparent that it was faulty as the toast was cooking very unevenly .
neutral	i contacted go_electrical who liaised with dualit back and forth a few_times to decide_whether the toaster was actually faulty or not , before eventually agreeing a refund .
neutral	while i was happy with the eventual outcome , i was a bit disappointed that even_though i '_d only had the toaster less_than a week before contacting them about the uneven toasting , they were reluctant to agree to an_immediate_refund / replacement and so spent a week or so going back and forth with dualit to decide_whether they '_d agree with me that it was faulty .
neutral	fair_enough if i '_d been using it for months , but i '_d only had it 0_days and so it should be a given that it was faulty from the start .
neutral	it all seemed to be going so well .
neutral	good product on the web_site , good price .
neutral	texts sent to let_me know that my flowers had been dispatched and had arrived .
neutral	then i spoke to my friend who was housebound after a knee_operation only to discover that the flowers never arrived .
neutral	after much emailing between me , serenata and their delivery company yodel i eventually got my money reimbursed but it was a shame because i just wanted to cheer_up a friend with a gift , not have loads of hassle .
neutral	someone out there is enjoying my lovely flowers .
neutral	i ordered the vampiress costume and the vampire bat mask when it arrived i tried it on only to find the collar on the costume did not stand up like it showed on the picture and the mask had a hair band to keep it on the head which kept slipping_down thus_making the mask fall down on the face , i returned it using royal_mail recorded delivery as was requested by yourselves which cost me £_00 . 00 .
neutral	considering the total value of the costume i find this charge excessive .
neutral	for my continued custom i would request some recompense .
neutral	yours_faithfully mrs . j . russell .
neutral	on - line ordering , tracking and delivery was very efficient .
neutral	in future , i will take more notice of customer reviews of the product and be ready to return goods , if they are not absolutely right .
neutral	the wellies i received are too large , so sizing is a real issue here .
neutral	i have tried thick_socks and insoles but still slide around in the boots , which makes them very uncomfortable as dog_walking_boots - the category under which they were advertised .
neutral	good service , but more accurate information needed !
neutral	initially pleased as items arrived well_packed however when i checked the items a week or two later i found 0 out of 00 items ( chocolate shot_glasses ) in a box broken .
neutral	although customer_services were helpful they had no further stock and i have to place another order to get " compensation ".
neutral	has left me feeling disappointed with the company .
neutral	quick reliable and cheap !
neutral	i was intending on booking 0 night in a hostel in a dorm room and then 0 night in a private_room at the same hostel the following night .
neutral	i found this hard to do and couldn_'_t really see an easy way of doing this on the website .
neutral	also when i paid for the room i thought i would automatically be signed_up to hostel_bookers website but i wasn_'_t i just had made booked and not created an account .
neutral	however - really good variety and other that than it is easy to use .
neutral	my booking was for the short_stay car_park upgrades from long_stay .
neutral	my car was not recognised on entry but because of a line of cars behind me i had to enter taking the usual ticket .
neutral	took it straight to the parking office , they said this shouldn_'_t happen but often does , advised me to take my ticket and booking sheet back to office on my return to edinburgh the next_day .
neutral	this again took time , good thing i had left plenty of space between my arrival and the plane '_s departure .
neutral	it was exactly as i expected inside and i '_m_sure they '_ll all taste lovely but the basket seems a little_bit cheap and the bow tied around it wasn_'_t cut , it was hacked .
neutral	the bow that was tied was also really roughly done .
neutral	i had to untie it , trim the ribbon and re - tie it nicely .
neutral	not what i expect from a luxury item .
neutral	bouquet small and unimpressed with it .
neutral	get better for less at a decent supermarket .
neutral	all parcels arrived and i was happy with the price i paid for delivery .
neutral	however , i chose to drop_off my parcels at a local collection_point ( petrol_station ) and the lady wasn_'_t very friendly who_served me .
neutral	i only had 0 parcels but she kept sending me to the back of the queue and said that paying petrol customers were her first priority .
neutral	not great service , not least as i '_d left my baby waiting in the car .
neutral	i have not yet received my package and information from you
neutral	i can not print my labels off ??
neutral	?
neutral	i phoned showerseal twice and emailed them four times over several weeks with a picture of my broken shower rollers , asking whether the product i had identified from the website was a suitable replacement .
neutral	in the end as they didn_'_t get back to me after the initial email asking me for more information , which i supplied , i went_ahead and ordered the rollers anyway , which work fine .
neutral	so i '_m pleased about the product but annoyed about the wasted time waiting for advice which never came .
neutral	the small bedale jacket that i bought for my grandson was faulty ( popper came off ) and had to be returned and they were not able to replace as item had been in the sale .
neutral	credit appeared on my mastercard but i have not had any communication from them .
neutral	got my tyres at a good price but they were not delivered to my chosen garage on the 0th_sept as planned .
neutral	this will cause me a lot of hassle as i chose this date as its my day off work .
neutral	i would have gave sheds . co . uk a 0_*.
neutral	having to speak to a very pleasant receptionist who did all she could to resolve the delivery problems i had .
neutral	the problems lay firmly on the delivery department who promptly phoned me back telling_me that the shed would be delivered on saturday . 0st lie .
neutral	they don_'_t deliver on saturdays !
neutral	i then was told they had phoned me to say it was out of stock .
neutral	0nd lie .
neutral	then was told they phoned me with a new delivery date .
neutral	0rd lie .
neutral	no one had spoken to us or left a message on the answering_machine .
neutral	sheds . co . uk please shake up your delivery department they are seriously letting you down .
neutral	haven_'_t put the shed up yet as the new delivery date has now over lapped our holiday and are now back at work ... the shed looks good quality though .
neutral	we '_ve had the hoover for a couple of months now and it '_s great .
neutral	it '_s heavier_than i expected but it seems to be robust .
neutral	the delivery was difficult to organise as they don_'_t deliver on weekends or during evenings and times / dates were made by an external delivery company when we weren_'_t in - the website said they did weekend deliveries but it turned_out they don_'_t - that was the reason we bought it then .
neutral	go - electrical were professional and did solve the problem as well as they could but it had to be delivered to my work during the day instead .
neutral	it '_s quite a heavy and bulky thing to carry home .
neutral	the price fluctuation made me think i was being cheated .
neutral	they should have within their policy of price adjustment especially when the price drops within the week of being ordered .
neutral	other than that , argos is great and it is one of the stores i frequently shop from .
neutral	they also have free_returns and other select accessories which makes it such a great place to shop from .
neutral	thought the service was excellent in the store .
neutral	delivery exactly as stated .
neutral	product well made and value for money except that one of the extension flaps did not quite fit and needed some manoeuvring to get it to fit .
neutral	not quite as it should be , the screws in the extension flap did not quite fit into the holes on the extension bars .
neutral	these capsules just do not work well in my nespresso latissimo machine .
neutral	my husband thinks its because they are not made from aluminium foil but clear plastic which does not pierce properly .
neutral	the coffee comes out in drips rather_than a flow and spurts everywhere on the machine creating a large mess and a not pleasant cup of coffee .
neutral	having said all that , when i sent the capsules back with their free_postage_label ( which is great ) i was sent my full_refund straight_away .
neutral	this is rare to receive such great service .
neutral	pity about the product !
neutral	there should have been some dosage instructions on the packet .
neutral	the staff arranging order and delivery couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
neutral	the staging arrived quickly and when arranged but the quality of construction should be better for the prlice .
neutral	i had to drill extra holes for the props for the legs as the original holes were too small for the bar of the props and two of the top slats stand proud by at_least an inch where the nails have gone in but not into the frame .
neutral	these need digging out and re fixing .
neutral	i dont expect to have to do that given the price .
neutral	there seemed to be lack of contact between your various departments , but i did receive a phone_call and actually speak to a live person which is extremely pleasing and hopefully everything is resolved .
neutral	paving arrived on the day it was expected .
neutral	slabs themselves were good quality , however on unpacking there were 0 broken slabs .
neutral	also the delivery vehicle damaged our driveway ( it ismade of asphalt and the tail_lift of the deliverytruck caused deep holes ).
neutral	i probably_wouldn_'_t recommend this company unless they change delivery method .
neutral	ordered flowers for my mother '_s 00th_birthday , ordered at_least 0_days in_advance with a delivery slot for before 00 ( noon ).
neutral	the flowers did not arrive until late_afternoon !!!
neutral	even_though i had paid_extra for that delivery time , and was also disappointed with the amount of flowers in the bunch .
neutral	they sent out the wrong item and it had to be returned .
neutral	how waiting for the correct item to come .
neutral	could aim for same day delivery if ordered
neutral	before a certain time as some medications need to be started as soon as possible so the covenience of online shopping is erased if you have to wait several days
neutral	this was about my 0th order , all others were good , sadly this order was badly packaged and 0 shampoo bottles were damaged - the tops had come off .
neutral	the shampoo was for my holidays but i can '_t take it now as it has no top !
neutral	i '_m a naturopath & acupuncturist .
neutral	glad that higher_nature have been able to get some herbal products licensed .
neutral	information is very good .
neutral	parcel took quite a long time to come compared with other_companies i use , where products arrive the next_day .
neutral	the quality of the products is excellent but very sad that it took five days and a phone_call before i received my order .
neutral	the ordering and delivery of wheelchair was great .
neutral	but all went down_hill after that .
neutral	we bought my mum this chair to save hiring one every time we went out .
neutral	chair very comfy and easy to manouver .
neutral	but the brake cable keep on snapping .
neutral	i have reported this as it was within the 0_months insurance , they are supposed to be sending out new cables , that was two_weeks_ago , as yet none have arrived , very bad customer_care .
neutral	if you are reading this please someone sort this .
neutral	my order took over a week to arrive , after having requested 0 - 0_days ' delivery , but arrive it did , in good condition .
neutral	i '_m not sure_whether i didn_'_t read everything properly or things weren_'_t made clear on the website but it wasn_'_t what i expected and put a bit of a dampener on the start of our_honeymoon .
neutral	i thought breakfast was included and it wasn_'_t .
neutral	i thought that our car would be parked from our arrival at the hotel and all we would have to do is walk across to check in from the hotel .
neutral	in fact , we had to park at the hotel for a night then drive to the long_stay car_park in the morning , park the car and get a bus back to the airport , which is exactly_what i wanted to avoid with a 0 . 00 am check in .
neutral	so all a bit rubbish really but it may have been partly my fault ..?
neutral	the flowers were lovely according to my mother in law , however the arrangement was small for the price .
neutral	i have ordered a few things from this site now and have always been pleased with my purchases .
neutral	the delivery is always quick and it is good value for money .
neutral	this rating would have been a 0 if it wasn_'_t for the fact half the things i like sell out quickly .
neutral	there are previews on facebook the day before things go on sale and they go on sale between 00 - 00 the next_day .
neutral	however , if like me you work and are unable to sit on the site at the exact time they go on sale you usually miss out on the best stuff .
neutral	there is no limit to the amount of each item you can buy so bulk buyers buy the best things immediately to sell at a profit .
neutral	this seems to be provided as feedback regularly but nothing is ever done .
neutral	this is the only_thing letting this site down .
neutral	although i got my goods in good time , the whole site wasn_'_t ipad friendly with many of the features unresponsive , a frustrating experience to an other wise good site .
neutral	:-)
neutral	i love the tv_cabinet that i purchased from oakfurniture_land , it looks so classy in my sitting_room , one fault though , i found a mark near the bottom which feels_like glue , i have rang up and promised an expert to come and look at it but up to now no one has came , but sure they will ring soon .
neutral	regards
neutral	i ordered 0 flashing tiaras , 0 arrived and was snapped with a gem missing .
neutral	i emailed last night including pictures but still_awaiting reply .
neutral	the flowers were lovely .
neutral	however deliver was awful , i had requested leave with a neighbour if no answer but the flowers were left_outside the front of the premises where they were all night because the recipient had been home all the time .
neutral	the flowers are meant to be taken out of packaging straight_away but instead spent the night outside suffering a torrential downpour .
neutral	ok , so when your washing_machine starts leaking you want to sort it asap .
neutral	pgs are a safe bet .
neutral	almost certainly not the cheapest and not even the quickest ( the best they could offer me was 0_days from time of call ) but they are thorough and know their stuff .
neutral	the guy they sent to have a look was an ex - bosch staff_member and knew the machine inside and out .
neutral	his advice was sensible , he could have fixed it ( but not on the spot ) but his honest advice was to buy a new machine .
neutral	which i have done
neutral	the brushes are fine and good value but the case was very cheap plastic and smelt so strongly i threw it away .
neutral	item has not yet been delivered because delivery driver ' could not find property '.
neutral	another delivery slot has_been arranged without_consulting me .
neutral	uncomfortable
neutral	the roman_blind arrived in time for christmas so we were thrilled about that , the quality is very good and it was very easy to put up , the only_downside is when putting the blind down it '_s really fiddly with the pull_cord especially as there is not much space in the corner of our room and as you need to be able to reach right up to nearly the top of the cord to let it down , the blind we '_d bought previously for our bedroom has a roller chain which is so much_easier , so sadly we '_ll definitely be fiitng the rest of the house with the the chain versions .
neutral	mother in law delighted which was the main_thing but did it look like what i ordered off the website ?
neutral	not really !
neutral	to start basket was supposed to be square , resemble a picket fence with a chequered ribbon .
neutral	one delivered was totally opposite , no ribbon that i could see to give it that traditional feel which i had hoped .
neutral	as for the flowers , very white compared to spring yellows and greens in the photo .
neutral	all in all i was pretty disappointed which is a shame :)
neutral	received the parcel promptly but packed in a fragile box so the poor fedora hat was not in good shape .
neutral	the adult yellow zoot suit was not fit to be seen out in , more for an over sized child to dress up in at home !!
neutral	!
neutral	however my outift babe flapper_dress was great x
neutral	overall i '_ve been satisfied with physioroom in the past but on this occasion the freebie that was advertised for the mueller back brace i purchased didn_'_t arrive and there was some_confusion when ordering , initially showing free delivery and then adding a charge .
neutral	i '_ll probably shop around in future as the price showed a 00_% saving but was similar to other_vendors ....
neutral	i needed the outfit quickly , very pleased when it arrived within two_days ..
neutral	the outfit was just what i wanted and good quality , felt fab in it too
neutral	was told i would be getting phone_call reguarding time of arrival no phone_call according to web_site my fridefreezer would be unwrapped when asked drivers was informed we are only couries so i a pensioner was left to do it myself so don_'_t hold your breath if you want anything unwrapped
neutral	order went_smoothly .
neutral	arrived on time and well_packaged .
neutral	problem was the actual items - i ordered 0 but had to send 0 back as it '_s not as large as it appears .
neutral	i always use aid but this time they did not deliver on the date agreed , i did get a call from the driver ( late morning ) saying there was a problem with the vehicle so they would deliver the next_day and put it down for an early delivery , it did arrive the folllowing day having phoned them to be told ' towards lunch_time ' it actually arrived at 0pm , so a bit dissapointed as had to wait in again but in the past they have been very reliable so hopefully this was a ' one - off ' and it hasn_'_t put me off using them in the future .
neutral	torquil bed is good quality , nice and solid but the photos gave the impression it is white .
neutral	on arrival , it turns_out to be most definitely yellowy cream .
neutral	as i intend to put it in a white room , i '_m going to have to paint it which is a bit of a drag .
neutral	slight gripe about the delivery charge as the map on the website suggested we were in the free delivery area but it turned_out we aren_'_t .
neutral	good customer service apart_from that .
neutral	i had read all_sorts of negative_reviews about smartbuy_glasses after i '_d placed my order .
neutral	i found their delivery was speeding to say that there were coming from so far away .
neutral	however i '_m still not sure if they are counterfeit or not ?
neutral	?
neutral	ok but unable to return and exchange for credit , also any free delivery with tracking is only for orders over_£_00 but would be kind for regular customers or at_least lower amount .
neutral	website sometimes is difficult to navigate and very hectic layout .
neutral	i would recommend this system for selling old_phones
neutral	my order took over a week to arrive although i did receive an explanation and apology so i '_m not concerned .
neutral	i ordered a sekection of meals that appealed to me but was very disappojnted that half of them contain vinegar which i cannot eat .
neutral	these will be given away .
neutral	i was surprised at this as have never cooked of eaten stews or curries where vinegar was an ingredient .
neutral	as the ingredients are not listed i won_'_t risk ordering again .
neutral	a pity .
neutral	no such problem with lwwf .
neutral	i have been on diet_chef for a while and planning on stopping this due to fact that i have felt ill consistently since been on this .
neutral	yes the food is tasty , yes it is convenient , yes i have lost_weight but my warning is , it just isnt possible to stay on it as long as it states .
neutral	the only way i have even felt human most days is to eat a lot of fruit and veg .
neutral	i expected to add some but this is ridiculous .
neutral	im not even that big and im nearly passing out .
neutral	plus i still had to calorie_count any way as your snacks are not labeled clearly .
neutral	had to weigh all fruit , veg , measure milk so to be honest i might as well cook my owneals and save my self a fortune .
neutral	if you are the sort of person_who_likes fad diets , living off liquids and spending a fortune for the privalidge , try this !
neutral	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller_portions .
neutral	plus having that many snacks in house at once was just a massive temptation .
neutral	i have ordered several_times from this site and while i can '_t fault the prices , i don_'_t like the fact they will buy things as f grade and sell them on as a or b !!!!
neutral	also they maintain they normally send items the same day ... that has never happened to me infact i am_currently_waiting for some dvds that have been in the ' stock pickingin progress ' stage for 0_days .
neutral	i didn_'_t experience problems like one reviewer thoughwho didn_'_t receive accessories with a phone , i did , but here is a company that definitely does lack in a few areas .
neutral	i ordered prescription_sunglasses , using the size of my current spectacles as a guide .
neutral	the glasses fit well but are not quite the right prescription .
neutral	they '_ll be ok but it is strange that they are not exactly the same as my glasses as i submitted the same prescription .
neutral	i sold an old laptop that was no_longer needed at home and through the cash in your gadgets i found they were willing to pay £_00 even_though the battery didn_'_t hold its charge ( compared with around £_00 on other_websites ).
neutral	the laptop was collected on the day agreed ( 00rd_december ) but i had to call on 00th_january because i hadn_'_t received my payment ( which according to the website should have been 00_hours from receipt ).
neutral	the advisor confirmed my laptop had been received on 00rd_december but hadn_'_t been checked yet .
neutral	the advisor said the money would be in my paypal_account on monday 00th_january , and to be fair it was .
neutral	i '_m just a little disappointed that it ooh so long , and i had to call them to ask about it .
neutral	having said that , i would use them again but i would be aware and chase the payment a bit quicker .
neutral	package came sooner_than_expected , but the costumes were dirty , stained and poorly packed . yes ... i would probably order from this company again .
neutral	i did a vlcd years_ago and did well on it .
neutral	i put a bit back on when my husband was ill and have decided to undertake another vlcd to shirt the weight again .
neutral	i liked the shakes and meal flavors including the carbanara .
neutral	the bars i found disapointing and a bit carboard like - other_vlcd bars are much_tastier .
neutral	i have , however , switched to another vlcd because i found that having 0 " meals " a day was much much harder that the 0 that i had on the previous vlcd .
neutral	i imagine that this is based on the idea of discouraging snacking etc but a vlcd is hard enough without making it harder thank_you !
neutral	over all a good vlcd but just not for me .
neutral	as above , however the shower didnt work !
neutral	it was under_warranty so triton engineer came out .
neutral	it was a manufacturing_fault , so not tap outlets fault , however that is why 0_stars instead of 0 .
neutral	i could make an order easily enough , although we didn_'_t have time to make the lanyards branded , but i fully accept it was a timing issue on my behalf .
neutral	however , the night before the event , they had still not arrived by 0pm , and we had to run to staples to buy substitutes which cost almost £_000 .
neutral	this was frustrating , but ultimately we had some - so crisis averted .
neutral	we didn_'_t have the tracking_number of the parcel - we called the office , who were helpful in that they contacted the delivery people , but i was told it would arrive by 0pm .
neutral	at 0 : 00 there was no sign , so i called the adband office back , and everyone had left .
neutral	so we had no tracking_number to continue trying to find it after they had all gone home .
neutral	the original ones we ordered arrived 0_days after the event .
neutral	( over 00 days from when they were originally ordered )
neutral	first of all , i hate the new website .
neutral	full of glitches , hard to navigate and their stock_levels are unreliable with some items selling out quickly and not replenished .
neutral	there isn_'_t enough info about the product and they give no guidance that i can see on the exact lengths of short medium and long for trousers etc which makes_life difficult as the models they use are usually 0 ' 00 so the pictures are no help at all .
neutral	i am not impressed with this season '_s clothes which veer from dated and boring to quirky and overpriced .
neutral	they don_'_t seem to be able to decide where to pitch themselves and with shoes for example they offer cheap synthetic heels then jump to decent leather courts at £_000 !
neutral	what about something in between .
neutral	i '_d be shopping in lk bennet and upwards if i wanted to spend more than £_000 /£ 000 on a pair of shoes .
neutral	their underwear , men '_s socks etc still seem ok , but this is hardly enough to keep them going .
neutral	on the plus_side , their instore delivery is prompt , though it is a shame you can return via simply food .
neutral	however , seem to have a good range of corner shops that you can return to .
neutral	we needed to join 0 lengths of full_stave work_surface to go along one side of the kitchen but they were really different and looked awful when joined together .
neutral	unfortunately we had already cut the wood so returning it was not an option , so we had to order another length .
neutral	when this was delivered it was still not similar enough so in the end we drove to gloucester with an off cut of the right work_surface so they could match it .
neutral	once this arrived it was a much_better match and the kitchen now looks great .
neutral	it was painful at the time but eventually we got there .
neutral	suggest other customers check the wood matches before cutting it !
neutral	they don_'_t really have the same online deals like they have in the shop and they are getting soo tight with some of the contracts
neutral	i was so looking_forward to trying this product , had such high_hopes after_reading about it , but it made no difference at all to my this hair on top .
neutral	i ordered a blue and white arrangement and my daughter received a pink and white , no blue at all !
neutral	!
neutral	i did put on the original order to be patient as elderly person living there .
neutral	your driver just banged on the front_door and left the flowers without waiting to see if anyone answered the door .
neutral	luckily the weather was ok and the fact that my father saw the van go past otherwise the flowers could have been ruined .
neutral	i have to say this is the first time this has happened .
neutral	the service was quick and i like the quality but the samples are not the same colour as they look on the website .
neutral	although they charged me for same day delivery , the flowers were not delivered until_0pm
neutral	it '_s not easy to exchange items which is not helpful as the prefer needs to be placed again .
neutral	going to the website is not straight_forward either
neutral	ordering cat_litter - great value for brand that our 00 year_old cat prefers .
neutral	quick processing , good communication but sadly delivery meant boxes were left in porch - split with cat_litter everywhere .
neutral	will not be ordering again .
neutral	the photo i loaded_onto my card came out looking grainy and darker_than it did on the screen which made the overall quality of the cards look cheap .
neutral	fast delivery .
neutral	delivered on time but with no message so my
neutral	nan did not know they were from me .
neutral	upset as they were in memory of my grandad who had passed_away .
neutral	the parcel was delivered but i felt 00 pounds for 00hour delivery was steep
neutral	dusseldorf airport - pick_up etc was absolutly fine - but the return was a different_story .
neutral	on a saturday the drop_off is on the ground_floor car_park ( level 0 ) there was an illegible hand_written board on the entrance so needed to circle the car_park to find a suitable entrance - there were no markings for individual car_rental lanes a sort of free for all with no signs , no lane markings , no people to ask .
neutral	long lanes of cars no knowing where to go !!
neutral	what actually happens is the car checkers work for all the companies so you can use any lane .
neutral	once you have been done there are no signs to the terminal_building so you end up going through what looks like an office block to find the terminal - all in all - long_winded , stressful and you are left late !
neutral	!
neutral	i found a hard - to - get sticker making set for my daughter '_s birthday on office etc for a good price .
neutral	my only_criticism is that it took 0_days to arrive - so it was delivered after her_birthday .
neutral	i '_d think_twice about using the site for ordering anything urgently_required .
neutral	i '_ve_used this service twice , and can '_t fault the website / service .
neutral	however , more takeaways need to sign up to takeaway . com as at the moment there is very little choice in my area .
neutral	so , could be good , if they build up a bigger client base :)
neutral	i ordered a beko double_oven for which i paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	as it said , you '_ll get a text , you '_ll get a call - all was fantastic .
neutral	got a follow_up call initialling asking " how was the service & goods " " fantastic " i replied , so much so we ordered the hob to match with delivery due wed - sat the following week , he then started to try and sell me extra insurance_cover which i had already gone_through when i rang to register the cover already available .
neutral	annoying .
neutral	i explained i had already had a text to say delivery will be 00 / 0 / 00 and then another stating between 0 - 00am .
neutral	the day was taken off work to be here , which means no pay , and at 0 . 00am on 00 / 0 / 00 , a message_saying " sorry , unable to deliver today , will now be thursday 00 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	i rang ao but there answer was " it '_s delivered by 0rd_party ".
neutral	i did say " which your company employs " but got no joy .
neutral	just a lot of sorry for that
neutral	unsure how i feel about the products received .
neutral	i '_m not going to lie they look nice and are good for the money but disappointed by the fact the engraving plates aren_'_t straight on half the trophies i brought .
neutral	i would have liked to have given a better rating but cant really due to that .
neutral	delivery was fine and came quick and easy process to order .
neutral	it worked well , the driver was very late on the day but otherwise reliable and saved us a lot of money from hiring a van and doing it ourselves .
neutral	i was a little surpised to see only a small_amount of flowers for the price spent , although they were beautiful .
neutral	ordering was easy and arranging delivery only confusion was the shop advised i had 0_days to check my delivery but the people delivering advised had to be done within 00_hours - this was confusing and as i had ordered 0 items difficult to comply with
neutral	the bird table we received was sent very efficiently , delivery details etc .
neutral	but the actual table was badly made and therefore difficult to put_together and is pretty wonky !
neutral	they have quite good products , but the usual problem with buying online ; once they have your email address you are inundated with marketing stuff .
neutral	i unsubscribed and thought the emails had eventually dried up .
neutral	however , trustpilot seems to have been given my address to ask for my opinion - so here it is .
neutral	i would be wary_about ordering any more from them in case it starts the whole emailing / catalogue thing all over again .
neutral	great selection of products but was appalled that they were literally just thrown into a box and sent , meaning they could rattle around and scratch so when they arrived some looked secondhand .
neutral	that bit was very disappointing as thought i had found a gem of a website .
neutral	the actual booking process itself was very quick and straightforward , except i had entered the wrong expiry_date in my card_details and the system simply ' hung ' rather_than give me an_error_message to say that my booking had not gone_through and why .
neutral	only other issue was that when trying to read other reviews or location details from a selected parking company , the screen would not scroll_down and therefore , i could not view all the information .
neutral	this was when using an ipad , i have not tried on windows .
neutral	other than that , cannot_fault fhr .
neutral	hard to do star_ratings when i dealt_with a machine
neutral	" malicious_intent " or friction don_'_t happen on line !
neutral	my daughter got us our trip as a christmas_present .
neutral	before we had left the dock we went to the bar , as i am a non drinker of alcohol i ordered a can of coke , i was told that they don_'_t sell cans at the bar only draught .
neutral	i asked for a glass of coke and also purchased 0 alcoholic drinks for the party .
neutral	the bar person poured a half a pint of diet coke from the gun , i stated i asked for a glass he replied that this was the correct measure and it cost 0 . 00 euro , so if i wanted a half pint it would be 0 . 00 euro , this was more_expensive than the alcoholic drinks .
neutral	considering that the diet coke was coming from the draught that isn_'_t expensive for your company to purchase , what is the price mark up ( profit )?
neutral	i tried not to let this spoil our journey and decided to purchase water or a can of red bull instead of the overpriced draught coke .
neutral	the 0 of us had prepaid meals in the steak house for the 0 nights .
neutral	the menu didn_'_t state that if you prepay the meals you are limited to what you can choose to eat or pay more .
neutral	the service and food was very good and this managed to cheer me up .
neutral	we had prepaid for an upgrade , room was very basic with flimsy pillow and thin towel .
neutral	room hadn_'_t been vacuumed properly and their was chocolate under the bed left by the previous occupant .
neutral	our party were in the bar and purchased a lot of alcohol while i had my water .
neutral	also there was some young_men and women from the armed_forces travelling back from amsterdam , the majority of them were non - alcohol drinkers too , i could see that they were disappointed about the price of a pint of coke .
neutral	on our last night i played the fruit machines and won 00 euro ( i spent more than that playing ) i asked if i could get the coins exchanged to notes and was rudely dismissed , the older lady that had earlier been hanging_around the black jack table stated " the machine shouldn_'_t have paid out " considering i had been playing the machines i was well aware of how to play them .
neutral	i did take the coins to the exchange in the morning and the staff there were very pleasant .
neutral	we spent about 0 , 000_euro between us on the boat .
neutral	we might travel again but may have to just stay in the basic cabin and drink my own cans of juice .
neutral	the fact that you don_'_t cater well for people that don_'_t drink is off putting .
neutral	hi , if your reading this you must be a buyer of beautiful jewellery just like me .
neutral	i '_ve received a £ 0 refund for goods not sent , considering i '_ve not been sent either the ring or bracelet what is the £ 0 refund for ????
neutral	it will not put me off purchasing more items from argento as it is my favourite shop .
neutral	maybe just let customers know if an item is not available as having one item sent ( if it does get sent ) might not be suitable if i '_ve nothing to match .
neutral	i am looking for a holiday in salzburg , austria and have not found what i am looking for with last_minute , although they are the first people to come up on a web search they don_'_t do it for me .
neutral	i '_ve done this flight from heathrow to nassau many_times .
neutral	the quality of the on - board service varies from excellent to appalling , depending_on who is in the team .
neutral	therefore i cannot give more than three stars .
neutral	i have been insulted by cabin_crew and treated like a princess - this does not make for a confident traveller , as you never know how your innocent request for a glass of water is going to be taken .
neutral	but the pilots usually arrive at the destination on time or early , so it '_s not all bad !
neutral	first time booking service .
neutral	travelling by bus to connection would have been easier if there had been indication of bus times on site .
neutral	have booked but as a fooot passenger told this is onlyy provisional two_days_later still await confirmation of trip .
neutral	had difficulty using maestro card and had to use credit_card .
neutral	the card was accepted quite readily when i used it next to book the bus .
neutral	i just felt i still do not know whether i can get a ferry to orknwy or not although i have paid for it .
neutral	the box is damaged and the engraved plate is on skuwiff
neutral	it was supposed to be here by 0 pm the next_day but was delivered the day after ... thats_why i ordered it on here for next_day delivery ...
neutral	i ended_up going to the pharmacy
neutral	i booked the jury '_s inn glasgow for sunday 00th_march at a cost of £_00 . 00 .
neutral	when i got to the hotel the room rate typed on to my room card was £_00 .
neutral	i therefore paid £_00 . 00 for the privilege of dealing_with ebookers !
neutral	i realise that the company needs to make money but i really think that £_00 . 00 per booking is a bit much .
neutral	i used ebookers a few_weeks_ago to book the hilton grovesnor and the same thing happened .
neutral	the rate printed on the receipt was more than £_00 less_than the price we paid to the company .
neutral	iam not impressed !
neutral	quality of the products very good .
neutral	i found my experience of ordering on line quite difficult , not enough help and information given .
neutral	when i telephoned the company direct for advise i did not find the staff that helpful almost made me feel as if was asking a daft question .
neutral	had three_separate_deliveries , with no prior e_- mail to advise dispatch for 0 order .
neutral	would not recommed to inexperienced d . i . y friend or anyone who works full time as receiving the deliveries is difficult
neutral	reasonable service , has not lost many of my parcels recently unlike before however i have discovered that other_companies offering a similar service are much_cheaper and even collect parcels from your door so i will be switching soon
neutral	ordering from rubbersole was a good experience .
neutral	they kept me informed with e_-_mails .
neutral	but the carrier they use , yodel , is not so good .
neutral	tracking my parcel was not easy .
neutral	they did not give a delivery day or time .
neutral	we work and were not in when they attempted to deliver the parccel , which you have to sign for .
neutral	you have to re - book a new delivery date using either an_automated telephone system or the internet .
neutral	there does not seem to be a way to contact them directly and speak with someone .
neutral	i had to wait in most of the day for the parcel to be delivered .
neutral	not good and a waste of my time .
neutral	it would be much_better if i could have arranged for them to leave my parcel behind our oil_tank , out of view in our back garden , like i do with other carriers .
neutral	i would try a different company due to the length of time the flowers where out for delivery .
neutral	not companies fault but i have had better from local_florists .
neutral	( quicker delivery )
neutral	booked through interparcel and citylink was due to collect .
neutral	no notification of delay but just did not turn_up .
neutral	the next_day i had to contact interparcel to find out where they were and when they might collect .
neutral	when cityklink arrived the next_day to collect he said he had left the area when he received notification of the pick_up the previous day .
neutral	i was annoyed because the day i booked it i waited in all day with the intention of going out the next_day but had to wait in again .
neutral	not good service .
neutral	i am not sure if it was interparcel or citylink that caused the delay in collecting .
neutral	it arrived_safely so i suppose that is a good thing !
neutral	the 0 items ordered were delivered on time correctly and the flowers appeared to be good quality .
neutral	however , i was disappointed by the small size of the exotic sheaf .
neutral	there was no size given on the website to enable a choice to be made , only descriptions ' standard ', ' large ' etc .
neutral	for the amount paid , i expected the size to be much larger .
neutral	this was a great replica of the top_gun movie but the dress was very figure hugging not so great for the larger lady and the bomber jacket was so plasticky it made me sweat just trying it on !
neutral	excellent service from jokers_masquerade though : 0 )
neutral	hello , everything was perfect with the order and shipping , except the product was a surprise gift for someone i was living with and because i was working on the day it arrived they got the door and of course all over the box was a clear stantment as to what it was so wasn_'_t happy about this
neutral	i don_'_t really use tcb anymore .
neutral	things i buy rarely track on sites such as ebay & play . com - which i use all the time .
neutral	i bought car insurance through tcb with the rac , i moved_house within 0_months of purchasing my insurance so i didnt get my cashback , i lost out on over_£_000 , this was incredibly_frustrating as it was the only_reason i bought that insurance as tcb made it cheaper .
neutral	i get fed_up with constantly nudging to try to get my cashback , it becomes a chore .
neutral	small_amounts soon mount_up , but whats the point if i dont always get my cashback ?
neutral	!
neutral	i now use boots treat street instead .
neutral	they cover many of the online stores i use , they track much_faster_than tcb , my points are quickly added to my advantage card and i '_m really looking_forward to the boots xmas sales where ill spend my boots points on treats for me and my family .
neutral	if tcb had been more reliable i would of stayed !
neutral	the website advertised that if i ordered before 0pm ( it was 0 . 00pm ), my flowers could be delivered same day .
neutral	in fact , i got a phone_call at 0pm from their customer service saying that they didn_'_t have any drivers to deliver that same day .
neutral	i was not very happy about it , and also told them that they were charging a premium for this service !
neutral	the lady apologised and proposed to put the extra money i paid into the flowers .
neutral	she assured me the flowers would be deliverd the next_morning .
neutral	they got delivered mid_afternoon !
neutral	all in all , it was too late for me to find an_alternative as they called too late on the same day and they delivered late the next_day .
neutral	real_shame .
neutral	however the flowers were superbe .
neutral	it was easy to organise the parking and the parking was conveniently_located to the airport_terminal however when i returned , after a long day , i had to request assistance to be let out because ( i presume ) the exit_barrier didn_'_t recognise my number_plate .
neutral	i '_ve_used the same system in heathrow and luton and never had problems .
neutral	i usually do well when ordering from fragrance_direct but this time i think folk '_s minds must have been wandering .
neutral	i ordered 0 bottle of a colour and got two ( charged for ) and the other bottle did not fit it '_s description being more white than lavender ( will be given away .
neutral	the sally_hansen serum is a definite good buy , i '_d had problems with packing to move home but a week '_s use and the improvement is very noticable .
neutral	i am moving from shetland back to england after 00 years and will compare_prices even more .
neutral	went alright in the end .
neutral	just not a very convenient way of returns .
neutral	i doubt i will be ordering from a animed again , as i could not track my parcel !
neutral	when i phoned the company on the email , that gave_me another company to ring , when i rang them , they said it was any time up till 0 0 ' clock !
neutral	the pet company i normally use , i can track my item and have a 0hour_window wgen they are going to deliver !
neutral	why , your company cannot
neutral	use a better delivery company , i don_'_t understand , what with all the choices out there .
neutral	so far , have always found petmeds reliable and easy to deal with .
neutral	i ordered a couple of mens t - shirts for christmas_presents and they are of great quality , but one thing i didn_'_t understand is that they didn_'_t have the superdry purchase tag in them ...
neutral	i am still happy with the items so they are still being used for presents .
neutral	great shop ... need more discounts so i can buy more
neutral	it wouldn_'_t be fair for me to leave a negative_review .
neutral	i ordered a small item from this company to give them a trial before ordering a bathroom_suite .
neutral	this order was completed to my complete_satisfaction .
neutral	however , i then ordered , and paid for , a bathroom_suite .
neutral	in honesty , it wasn_'_t a terrible experience .
neutral	it transpired_that the suite was not available .
neutral	the gent i spoke to re this immediately asked if i wanted to cancel my order .
neutral	i didn_'_t --- i wanted to know how long i would have to wait .
neutral	he told me he would contact the supplier and get back to me within the hour .
neutral	he didn_'_t so i rang again .
neutral	the gent i then spoke to said they would get back to my close of business .
neutral	he didn_'_t so i cancelled the order the next_day .
neutral	i would have been happy to wait but the fact that the customer_services proved so unreliable made me very very wary of taking the order further .
neutral	again , in fairness , my payment was refunded straight way so i am confident that they are a trustworthy company .
neutral	however , it seems a little unprofessional to advertise goods that you are not in a position to provide and the poor communication would make me wary of ordering larger items from this company in the future .
neutral	unfortunately the item i really wanted was no_longer available and the other item did not arrive .
neutral	it took a few phone_calls before the problem was sorted .
neutral	the person_who delivered the replacement acknowledged that he had delivered it to the wrong_address .
neutral	other orders have been more successful .
neutral	received chicken drumsticks on 00th_april and were use by 00th_april .
neutral	i thought this was a bit short as the other meats had much longer .
neutral	also , they seemed a bit smelly so i didn_'_t use them .
neutral	am happy with the items that i bought and the delivery service i received .
neutral	however , when i added items to my basket when ordering , i would expect to see at this point whether items were " out of stock ", i would then choose something_else .
neutral	this did not happen and i only realised my item was missing when i received the delivery dispatch email .
neutral	it did not tell me the item was out of stock and would be sent later , it was just missing from the list .
neutral	i had to call customer_services to get this clarified .
neutral	this could definitely be improved as it '_s not difficult to state this when ordering , or be clearer when sending the dispatch email .
neutral	as the order was urgent i had to order this item from elsewhere , the refund from proswimwear was dealt_with quickly .
neutral	i telephoned to place an order for my friend to be delivered last friday ( same day delivery ) as her father had passed_away the previous night .
neutral	no - one contacted me to say there was a problem with delivery and it would be delivered the next_day .
neutral	i telephoned to find out what was going on , received apology and was told it could be upgraded .
neutral	i said i didn_'_t want an upgrade , i paid a lot for same day delivery and i would like that cost refunding instead .
neutral	i was told that would be ok .
neutral	i have not received any information about a refund , so would appreciate some response .
neutral	on the plus_side , my friend said the flowers were beautiful and really appreciated them .
neutral	however , i have been put off using the service again as same day is not same day and refunds aren_'_t issued .
neutral	ordering was very easy and acknowledgment and dispatch very speedy but cannot_comment on the goods as have not yet recieved them
neutral	your new website is great to look at but the drop downs don_'_t give you enough information about where to look for products and your product search_facility is unhelpful .
neutral	it wasn_'_t very good before the update but it is no better now - shame !
neutral	!
neutral	having said that , service & delivery is spot_on .
neutral	the bed is fine and was fairly easy to put_together , though i advise a second_pair of hands to steady pieces while the screws are inserted in the holes .
neutral	being metal , the angles need to be pretty precise , but once they are in the tightening etc is a doddle .
neutral	daughter is thrilled with the bed .
neutral	the mattress is lovely as well - well_wrapped , clean , and very comfortable .
neutral	my issue was with the delivery .
neutral	it arrived on the day , and i got a phone_call 00_minutes before they arrived , which was fine , and they were also well within the four_hour delivery slot .
neutral	so that was all good .
neutral	however , firstly , they blocked the neighbour '_s drive with their van when she was trying to leave , which was totally_unnecessary as they had heaps of room outside my house for the van .
neutral	then , the delivery guy_who came to the door complained he had a bad back and couldn_'_t carry the bed up the stairs .
neutral	when i said he could just leave it leaning on the stairs and i '_d do it , he then insisted he '_d be fine and proceeded to carry the parts up the stairs in_spite of that .
neutral	when he went up i could see he had a loose shoelace and pointed it out as i did not want him to trip on it , but he just shrugged and said it didn_'_t matter .
neutral	he carried on up and down the stairs , loose shoelace and all .
neutral	fortunately , he didn_'_t trip over it , but that is beside the point .
neutral	the last thing i need is the potential of a delivery guy in a crumpled heap at the bottom of my stairs !
neutral	has anyone taught them about health and safety ?
neutral	0_days since being advised that goods have been despatched by 0nd_class mail .
neutral	still no sign of my goods .
neutral	everything else i order from the net arrives within a couple of days when i chose 0nd_class mail from other_companies .
neutral	easy to book and items collected and delivered as quoted and good price .
neutral	unfortunately my case has_been lost and i am waiting to see if it can be found .
neutral	found the gentleman that felt with my claim .
neutral	a little rude .
neutral	so i would not use your company again .
neutral	ang i wouldn_'_t recommend your services either .
neutral	i ordered these rockport boots and they were considerably_cheaper_than_anywhere_else on the internet but the delivery time was long .
neutral	i ordered them on the 00th_february and recieved them 0nd march .
neutral	apart_from the confirmation there was no notification that there was a problem i had to call the company to find that out .
neutral	this spoiled the experience as the boots are great price even better but for me lack of communication made me nervous when i heard_nothing and had no boots .
neutral	after the phone_call i received a dispatch email .
neutral	if this had not happened i would have rated higher
neutral	had we realised there was a tiny fault on our original photo we probably would have picked another one .
neutral	we would have appreciated your quality control team telling us it really wasn_'_t good enough ' cos now it '_s the first thing we notice as it '_s ten times bigger !
neutral	and on your production side , the photo is not ' square ' to the frame .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	the bottom and right hand edges show a white tapering margin which should not be there at all .
neutral	so between us we didn_'_t do very well did we ?
neutral	well you did ask !
neutral	colin burton
neutral	i joined_topcashback after_reading recommendations from various_sources including the daily mail and was pleased to gain £ 0 . 00 cashback after buying an item of furniture - however when i asked for my cashback to be paid into my account i only received 0 . 00 pence as topcashback took £ 0 in admin_fees which i wasn_'_t expecting and hadn_'_t been forewarned about - very disappointing and hardly worth_bothering with !
neutral	great sunglasses , great price super quick delivery but sunglasses have a couple of scratches on them the scratches are not major but if i was in a shop buying them i wouldn_'_t have taken that pair especially when paying over_£_000 .
neutral	loved the range of cards , but they put the wrong age on the one chosen so aged my sister by years which wasn_'_t appreciated .
neutral	i had been searching on - line for a new grey coloured bbq_cover for the spectrum 0 flatbed bbq and sourced one on the riverside_garden_centre '_s website - the colour was clearly grey in the pictures .
neutral	ordering was quick and easy and delivery was exceptionally quick - however when the cover arrived it was green .
neutral	on contacting the company , they confirmed with outback that all the covers supplied are green - the grey ones are exported ?
neutral	it was accepted that the website was misleading and assurance was given that the website pictures would be changed .
neutral	had to contact the seller twice to explain that they had taken my payment via_paypal but hadn_'_t processed my order .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t noticed it i doubt they would have as the first customer service representative i spoke to was insistent that i had only registered with the site and not actually ordered anything .
neutral	noticed again later that day that my order still hadn_'_t been processed so called again .
neutral	this time the customer service representative sorted my order in a couple of minutes .
neutral	the items and prices are great !
neutral	the product has_been improved slightly and the water now flows through the capsule a little faster however the coffee does not taste as good as nespresso original capsules and the saving on price is not that great so i will be buying from nespresso in future .
neutral	over_£_000 taken out of my account and nothing received
neutral	i ordered my boots on 00th_december and still_haven_'_t received them .
neutral	despite ringing rubbersole 0 times they keep saying they will be delivered soon .
neutral	they also said there was a problem with the tracking_numbers and old need to wait .
neutral	i rang yodel direct and gave them the tracking_number but they said it didn_'_t exist and they said here was no parcels for my address details .
neutral	now desperate to get my money back !
neutral	i have now received my boots .
neutral	i called rubbersole ?
neutral	basically the fault was with yodel .
neutral	i arrived home to find my parcel dumped in the garden ?
neutral	it had been raining all day but yodel still dumped my parcel ?
neutral	the box was sodden , wet through but my boots were ok . rubbersole have said they will give me a 00_% refund so thank_you
neutral	on a positive_note , the parcel was delivered promptly .
neutral	on a neagative note , i received an_email from the sales_team asking me to call them as the payment had not gone_through , i promptly did this and they asked me to give my bank details over the phone , i was alarmed re this , hoiwever i did it as wanted the parcel , but , to my horror , the person then said this was not the right name they had .
neutral	the orders had been mixed up and my order had indeed been processed and there was no problem with it .
neutral	i sent an_email about this and am still_waiting on a reply !!
neutral	!
neutral	i tried this coffee as the regular coffee for my nespresso_machine was becoming very expensive .
neutral	good service but slightly_disappointed in the coffee as it is certainly not as good and much weaker than my usual coffee .
neutral	the pods do work in my machine but i generally have to put them through twice to get a good cup .
neutral	i might try a different sort next time to give them a fair trial ..
neutral	the two items that i ordered were light in weight and total came to £_00 . 00 postage for these two small items were now wait for it £_00 . 00 . i called them to enquire why the postage was more than my purchase and was told that the delivery company charge them that price so if i had ordered say 0 fire_extinguishers i would have just had to pay the same amount crazy i think
neutral	fabulous delivery time , great drinks but you need to sort_out your extremely un - environmentally_friendly packing methods .
neutral	scrunched_up recycled paper would protect bottles just fine .
neutral	i paid £ 0 . 00 for p_&_p (+ vat ) and could only select next_day delivery .
neutral	that was on thursday , the goods didn_'_t arrive until the following_tuesday , i asked for a refund for the delivery charge and was eventually told that was ok .
neutral	i got a credit_note for the whole amount but have subsequently been invoiced for the goods on one invoice and the delivery on another ..... i . e .
neutral	the whole amount !
neutral	on top of that , the goods i orderded ( 0 " x00 " plastic_bags ) are all too short !
neutral	my chair arrived damaged , which can happen sometimes , so i wasn_'_t too put out , but organising someone to come round and fix it was a hassle .
neutral	this was done through a third_party used by made and involved a lot of unreturned calls on my behalf .
neutral	i would like to see made sharpen up this element of the service .
neutral	the shoes i ordered were a bargain in the sale .
neutral	the service however was terrible , it took 0days to receive my order in which time i had managed to receive , send back and reorder and receive another pair of shoes from a different website !
neutral	my order was delivered on time but was damaged .
neutral	i have yet to be able to contact serenata to resolve this issue .
neutral	not happy :(
neutral	your website does not work at all , however the service from the office is great .
neutral	after a long wait sandals have arrived .
neutral	i must_say that customer_services were really helpful and friendly and i would use the company again .
neutral	sandals were just what i was hoping for .
neutral	booked a hen_weekend in cambridge for my sister and 00 girls .
neutral	great choices to choose from as a very mixed age_group and also personalities .
neutral	had a few hitches with the company during the booking stage , i felt like i was asking too much when all i wanted was a few more invites added .
neutral	i was also told different things by different members of staff .
neutral	when i first booked the gentleman was great and we set_up suitable activities and times .
neutral	but then when the final itinerary came out this was very different .
neutral	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
neutral	although the second activity we changed to i feel was much_better on the actual night it just caused myself as the organiser unnecessary_stress .
neutral	i also feel the company need to change the way you pay so people can pay little and often as i found those tight for money struggled with the bulk payments and deadlines .
neutral	so the weekend itself started off great , we managed to book in early to the holiday_inn which was great !
neutral	so we all arrived at our first activity which was dirty_dancing , unfortunately the company had told me a different time to what they actually booked .
neutral	i was informed 00 . 00 but the bar was told 00 . 00 .
neutral	this would then effect the rest of the day , but i managed to change our next activity to be half an_hour later .
neutral	no further hitches , dirty_dancing was great and so was cocktail_making !
neutral	so all in all a fab weekend just a shame the organiser had the added stress .
neutral	i was happy with serenata '_s services except that when they delivered the flowers , they did not include the message that i had put and as such the recipient was left_wondering who sent the flowers , which was a big_disappointment for me , especially when i had gone out of my way to source a local company and not gone for interflora as i ` normally do .
neutral	it was a very quick service and it was waiting for me when we came home though i thought i had to sign for as it came by the tracker post
neutral	tried to order an item when 00_% offer running but was told it wasnt available for my post_code but somehow it became_available as soon as the offer ended .
neutral	good quality cards but not a great choice in fonts borders etc
neutral	i went to a shop to buy sunglasses and chose some at £_000 by persol .
neutral	another customer then told me that i should go home and order the same ones from an online company , that i could get them much_cheaper , and sure enough , smart buy glasses was advertising exactly the same sunglasses ( and all_sorts of variations on my choice - colour , size etc ) at £_000 .
neutral	other_sites were offering them at £_000 ish so i decided to try them .
neutral	i had difficulty paying with my bank cards online and finally had to use paypal when neither my debit_card nor my credit_card would authorise the transaction without_any good reason .
neutral	it looked like i would get the the sunglasses in 0 - 0_days and i was due to go on holiday 00 days_later .
neutral	before going , they still had not arrived and customer_services only replied to my email after i had left to go on holiday .
neutral	after i got home from holiday , they had still not arrived and i started to think that this was a scam , especially as i saw some online reviews starting that the company was a scam and i remembered my bank hadn_'_t authorised the transaction .
neutral	i had had some email correspondence from their customer_services department , but was basically thinking i '_d been_scammed , and then , after about 0_weeks , i started to get emails implying that the sunglasses might actually be on their way .
neutral	sure enough , 0_weeks after i placed my order , the sunglasses i ordered actually turned_up - safe and sound , the real item , carefully_packaged .
neutral	in conclusion , the customer_services email service was slow , but courteous , the website was misleading , implying that delivery would be 0 - 0_days , but i did receive a number of email order updates , and the sunglasses actually arrived .
neutral	i was also offered a discount as an_apology for the delay , although i '_m not sure how i would get that , and haven_'_t seen any kind of a refund .
neutral	not sure i could actually recommend the company , but i did get the sunglasses i wanted at a great price , despite the huge delay .
neutral	i ordered and said for a baby sleeping_bag .
neutral	i received an_email to say the item had been dispatched but it never arrived .
neutral	when i rang to chase it i was told it was out of stock .
neutral	the number is not clear on the website and took me quite a while to find it .
neutral	had i have not rang up , i would still have said for an item i was never going to receive !
neutral	ten_minutes into trying to make the purchase above i lost the will to live !
neutral	when i tried to access the terms and conditions i kept being sent back to the beginning .
neutral	i sent an_email requesting the t '_s & c '_s - nothing happened .
neutral	when i completed the details , my payment was declined and advised to start again .
neutral	when i tried to start again i was ' told ' that there was already an account in that name .
neutral	i sent an_email asking what exactly was the problem and got one back not answering my questions merely stating that they could see there had been an issue with payment but the payment had been made .
neutral	my payment must have been correct in the first place as i had done nothing further .
neutral	i felt that despite the friendly / quirky style of the emails , customer service ie making the customer feel secure , safe and important was not a great strength .
neutral	i know you have made the decision to remove the telephone facility but in circumstances such as that i found myself it would have been a weight off my mind not toe mention the feelings of frustration .
neutral	when it was finally sorted_out the emails were informative and clear and as i said above the recipient was delighted .
neutral	i am not sure if i will use the company again as although the end_result was very good , the journey was a bit of a nightmare !
neutral	incidentally i '_m pleased to see that the t & c '_s of trustpilot work !!!
neutral	!
neutral	however i was mostly disappointed that they arrived so late at tea time of the day of my choice ,..
neutral	if i had known this when ordering , i would have made other arrangements as i prefer flowers to arrive in the morning ... the day is practically over at tea time and could look to the receiver that it was done last_minute ..
neutral	i understand that there are several orders to deliver and someone has to be last , but i personally think delivering flowers that late is not good ... also the roses have started to go brown only after 0_days , and we have counted 00 pieces of greenery and only 00 flowers .... it would have been better to have a few more flowers for the money paid ..
neutral	i won this trip and a stay in center parcs with a magazine , the ferry trip was ok the beds on the outward crossing were very uncomfortable ( so no sleep ) , the meals were adequate but not great , but we did not get the bottle of wine with our dinners and visit to the captains bridge as promised in the competition details , we did explain to the waiter but he said we had to pay !
neutral	!, the prices onboard were extortionate on the home journey we were in a different cabin and the beds were not much_better , but again no bottle of wine with dinner i have to say i was not impressed with the whole_experience
neutral	items collected promptly and was really pleased only to have contact with the lady i sent the products too , to be told that 0 of the items were damaged :(
neutral	i wanted the flowers delivered on a different date .
neutral	i tried to contact the company but they don_'_t accept phone_calls !!!!!!!
neutral	i sent a text and two emails but i didn_'_t have a reply apart_from the fact that they had my email .
neutral	how do i do an order for a future date , please .
neutral	disappointed that it '_s not easy to organise a return
neutral	had a few things defo depends on shop , del been fairly good
neutral	i was really impressed with the drop box delivery service , easy and convienient .
neutral	i bought two outfits , one i thought was value for money but the other i was more than disappointed with , i just dont have time to return it as i didnt have time to find an_alternative .
neutral	quality of material poor and extra thread hanging everywhere .
neutral	probably cost £ 0 to make and i paid £_00 .
neutral	not sure i would use site again .
neutral	i ordered two items , only one arrived and there was no_indication that the other item was out of stock or coming at a later date , so i am still_waiting - full money was debited from my account though .
neutral	i also sent an_email asking a question about usage and still , to date have had no response .
neutral	they made us pay 00_euros for a tank fuel .
neutral	we full the tank for only 00 during the rental ....
neutral	i am not too sure if the base of the sofa on which the cushion sits on is touch enough to withstand overweight people .
neutral	also the cushions seem to push you forward and do not stay or look firm as they have a dent where a botton has sat .
neutral	otherwise it looks ok .
neutral	i ordered a stag and doe statue for my mum christmas early_december and it did not arrive until the thurs 0th of feb .
neutral	i was told on ordering it would not be in stock unitl the beginning of january so i knew we would not get it for christmas but the 0th of feb was a bit too long !
neutral	mid jan i had to chase it up and ask where it was and was told it was still not in stock .
neutral	i got one phone_call on the last_week of january to say it would be delivered the following week and would arrive on the tues 0 or wed_0th .
neutral	my sister had to stay int_he house for two_days waiting and it arrived on neither day .
neutral	she was luckily in the next_day and it arrived on that day .
neutral	poor communication really !
neutral	on one of my previous_orders i paid for the delivery which is usually free , to receive samples of products for potential further_purchases , my order arrived as usual on time , but no sample products arrived .
neutral	i have used you since , but will not be paying for postage again , and you did not respond when i contacted you by email .
neutral	i will still use you again and recommend you to family and friends , but on this occasion i felt very let_down .
neutral	tricky putting down the correct house number for my post_code , else was a straightforward application .
neutral	booking_fee and cancellation charge are not clearly_marked with the price when booking .
neutral	over_£ 0 extra at the end of tge booking was a surprise .
neutral	it wasnt specified before purchasing that i would need a home printer to print a label .
neutral	they wouldn_'_t take my collection without it and took over 00_hours to respond that i would need to rebook on a different service .
neutral	more trouble than it was worth but i did eventually get the package sent .
neutral	i have used this company before and am disappointed as it says you get reward point but it have none carried forward and i only brought items in december_0000
neutral	but the product is good and quick delivery
neutral	although i haven_'_t tried any of the meat yet i was impressed with the delivery information i received via_email , and the fact that it arrived on time .
neutral	however i do not understand_why the burgers had been previously frozen as there is no way that my husband and i would eat 00 burgers when they arrived , we cannot re freeze them and so they have been thrown_away , what a terrible waste of food and money !!!!
neutral	this is supposed to be fresh_meat .
neutral	also i do not want to received constant_emails about your happy team and would i like to chat with them , if i want a chat i will phone a friend .
neutral	a long time to take my things
neutral	ordered stethoscope ; new delivery address so had to confirm .
neutral	online help very difficult to navigate ; no obvious way just to confirm this online .
neutral	help_desk only open mon to fri - 000 - 000 which made it difficult to be able to call .
neutral	however when did speak
neutral	to someone they were very helpful , answered quickly and issue sorted within 0 mins and item dispatched the same day .
neutral	would use again , but please change online help !
neutral	the delivery was fast once the product had been sent .
neutral	however it did take 0_days for them to contact me to say the product didn_'_t have the box as_described .
neutral	as this was a gift and running out of options i agreed to stick with my order minus the box .
neutral	yet little sad to see i have still had to pay the full_amount even_though i '_m not receiving the full advertised product .
neutral	the service was good but the quality of flowers poor .
neutral	the roses arrived curly at the edges with brown leaves .
neutral	yes , it was hot !
neutral	good price & despatched promptly .
neutral	however overnight delivery actually turned into 0_days !
neutral	not impressed with delivery company .
neutral	easy on line booking was great , reasonable_price but getting to the airport late at night with two young_children to not be able to find the rental_car company orlando anywhere at the airport was stressful if i had known that it was going to be a bus to the rental company before , i would have felt more prepared or possibly paid a bit more .
neutral	when we eventually got the car all went well .
neutral	can '_t really give a rating on products as i '_m still_waiting for delivery they say 0 - 0 working_days but this has taken a very long time , the slowest to delivery for online shopping so far .
neutral	since placing the order on the 0st_nov i '_m still yet to receive it and it '_s now the 0th_nov .
neutral	hoping my order will be here on monday_morning .
neutral	the wrong glasses sent but after a phone_call the right ones sent out to me by the next_day
neutral	thought that the frankenstein costume was slightly expensive when all it was , was a jacket and wig .
neutral	all seems ok with cover but leaving tomorrow and no printed copy .
neutral	booked 0_days ago and charged extra for this .
neutral	disappointing - hope service is better if i have to claim .
neutral	00p_per cd wasn_'_t much , but i got a cheque and informative emails about my sale .
neutral	not as bad as others make out , just don_'_t expect to get paid much !
neutral	easy to use website , good range of products .
neutral	spoke to a customer service agent who was a bit cold , but factual .
neutral	reasonable delivery time - extortionate delivery costs .
neutral	for the price i would expect guaranteed next_day delivery not 0 - 0_days
neutral	the service from diamonds_factory has_been excellent .
neutral	including getting the ring sent to me even quicker_than they specified .
neutral	the design of the ring is also great .
neutral	however , at first the diamond looked incredible and we were really pleased but then we have looked at it and can see a bad inclusion .
neutral	a very noticeable black dot inside the middle of the diamond .
neutral	it really ruined it for me .
neutral	i know we ordered si0 but we didn_'_t expect a major flaw like this .
neutral	it is so disappointing and now seems like a very expensive mistake .
neutral	slip , the boots were lovely just too_big , so had to return them , but it cost me 0 quid to return them to sweden safely , this amount would put me off ordering again as it all adds_up if you have to return them , the sizes are generous but i didn_'_t know that till i ordered and tried them on , other than that no_complaints .
neutral	linda
neutral	love the product , but was slightly_disappointed with the shipping time , as it was for a christmas_present and i '_d ordered it well in_advance , but ended_up hoping it would arrive in time to wrap up .
neutral	flowers were fantastic but company was asked to leave them with a neighbour and instead they were left out over night outside the front of the garage door !
neutral	luckily there was no rain , wind or thieves !
neutral	they also weren_'_t delivered until 0 . 00pm on the day of my mum '_s birthday , which is why she was out when they were delivered .
neutral	loved the nails_inc scrub i bought however there was no seal on it and the lid of the tub did not screw on properly and had obviously already been opened .
neutral	i bought this as a present however due to the opened packaging i kept it and bought them something_else .
neutral	it was however a fab item - so i kept it rather_than complaining and asking for refund .
neutral	would however be dubious_about buying from here for presents as other goods i bought weren_'_t wrapped in the cellophane wrapper .
neutral	the experience was ok .
neutral	the only_thing that concerns me as i have not made the crossing before is it well signed to the actual boat itself once we make our way to calais
neutral	really pleased with the product and packaging but took 0_weeks to arrive and had to be chased
neutral	our parcels have only just been delivered in the last hour so have not been opened yet for us to check them .
neutral	parcels to jersey need to have a visible declaration of the value of their contents so that customs ( in jersey ) don_'_t impound the parcel .
neutral	we had to create a customs declaration on - line before the boxes could be released to us .
neutral	the fact that ' back in action ' didn_'_t know about this is disappointing but i '_m_sure they will remedy this when we place our next order with them .
neutral	:))
neutral	the security_tag was left on one of the items and now i have to return it or take it into a shop to have it removed .
neutral	inconvenient , costly and annoying !
neutral	this site is ok .
neutral	it doesn_'_t give you much detail and you need to know the make of the vehicle you ' re checking .
neutral	i just use it to check the cost of tax for any new cars i buy .
neutral	the balloon was apparently nice but didn_'_t stay inflated very long and i paid for next_day delivery but it took 0_days which was very disappointing as i missed my daughters_birthday date ,
neutral	client depuis quelques années , le_prix de croquette pour mes lapins devient le plus en plus cher .
neutral	le sachet de 00_kg été vendu à 00 . 00_euros en avril est maintenant à 00 . 00_euros !!
neutral	pour_les mêmes produits sur_le site petmed . co . uk , le_prix est nettement moins cher , malgré que_le fait au royaume uni le tva est plus haut .
neutral	this is the first time i '_ve sold phones and although when i spoke to frankie he was more than helpful can i suggest that if a phone is red flagged you just send them an_email asking for proof of purchase .
neutral	that did not happen in my case , i was just sent emails that panicked me , if i knew that was all i needed to do it could have been done in hours rather_than days
neutral	love the rington '_s products and the fact they ' re delivered to the door but what is going on !
neutral	they deliver in my area but they want me to pay for delivery if i order of the website - otherwise i can only have access to the limited stock that the van carries .
neutral	the alternative is a 00 day wait .
neutral	i '_m_sure this will be addressed at some time but it '_s a bit of a pain and needs some joined up thinking .
neutral	it '_s probably just a process that needs re - looking at .
neutral	i bought two kabuki powder brushes and a brush_set in a leatherette case .
neutral	the brushes were ok , a few bristles loose , except the retractable lip brush was just an empty casing , presumably the brush part was stuck in the other side .
neutral	also the leatherette pouch is just an embarassment if you ' re giving the set as a gift , such bad quality it makes it look like the whole lot came from the poundshop .
neutral	i ended_up discarding it and wrapping the brushes alone .
neutral	not perfect quality but still probably worth a try for the price , especially if you get through a lot of brushes .
neutral	i thought having the groceries delivered to the door would be great as i work full time and my time off is precious .
neutral	the delivery was prompt and the delivery man very polite , problem was that the fresh items delivered had one or two day shelf_life , many items where looking past the shelf_life .
neutral	i contacted when i at first_glance saw items that had perished who where extremely apologetic and sent me an e_- voucher to compensate me .
neutral	but as the next couple of days unravelled i found more items with same day delivery shelf_life .
neutral	this experience has put me off getting my groceries delivered .
neutral	i was expecting a green vase to go with my friend '_s decor and she received lilac .
neutral	she is definitely not a lilac person so i am very disappointed .
neutral	such a hard website to navigate
neutral	good service but not top quality , i was expecting like it details on the advert that the delivery man would take the shopping into the kitchen , but he just left it at my front_door , and it wasnt all bagged either .
neutral	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something_else now i understand that they do run_out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic ..
neutral	company itself , there were no_issues , but the carrier they use leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	the package stated it required a signature , there was no notification of when it was to be delivered , then a card stating we had not been in and to use the internet to rebook a delivery between 0 and 0 .
neutral	this completed , they then tried to send on a different day , again ; left a card offering a phone number to contact .
neutral	we then rang this number and they confirmed they had received the email and the package was being delivered that day , but could not specify a time ., 0 phone_calls later having been waiting for them to return my call i finally spoke to someone at nearly 0pm who told me the truth that the package had never been coming out that day due to " technical_issues that morning ".
neutral	eventually thay recontacted animed to confirm that no signature was required , and the package was delivered with no problem the following_day .
neutral	it would have been far simpler for no signature to have been required on the first delivery .
neutral	don_'_t know about it
neutral	hi i thought the website was ok to use and had some vouchers to use which i purchased through_groupon for some discounts on hotels .
neutral	was very disappointed to be confronted with a £ 0 . 00 booking_fee for using a debit_card , which made the saving only £_00 rather_than £_00 for the £_00 voucher which i bought for £_00 .
neutral	apart_from that all was ok with the exception of the old photographs for the hotel that i booked in hondaribbia in spain which were very out of date displayed on the alpha_rooms website and the when i mentioned this to the hotel they said they would contact head_office as they had refurbished over 0 years_ago .
neutral	i would definitely use these again as there is a wide_variety of wormers that are much_cheaper_than the saddlery and delivered quickly .
neutral	however , when i emailed asking advice for the wormers , i didn_'_t get a reply ( in 0wks ) so had 0seek advice elsewhere before purchasing from these_guys which was slightly_annoying and then i realised it was beeston_animal_health whom i '_d been in to see a couple of weeks earlier for advice on my new pony who was riddled with worms and they told me not to worm him again for 00wks after the pramox ?????
neutral	surely not ?
neutral	anyway ...... cheap and fast for the wormers but go elsewhere for your advice !
neutral	i booked for a pick_up today and my booking and money was accepted .
neutral	then i got an_email_saying interparcel couldn_'_t pick_up today , but would come tomorrow .
neutral	i would appreciate being told before not after payment !
neutral	i also object to being told i am in the highlands and islands .
neutral	i am not .
neutral	the highlands and islands are a distince and well defined area .
neutral	i am in aberdeenshire .
neutral	it is like saying devon is in cornwall .
neutral	driver knocked on door placed note with flowers saying sorry you weren_'_t in before parents had time to get to door also flowers left up side down .
neutral	mum reported flowers were lovely
neutral	our over all experience with interparcel is great , reliable and efficient , we send out many parcels and they are in the main delivered as per agreements .
neutral	our only_gripe is that when things go_wrong it can be immensely frustrating , with queries taking a day or more to be answered and investigations taking up to 00 days to get any firm answers .
neutral	from our point of view , when customers are waiting for goods , having to tell them we have no idea where their goods are and it could be some days until we know is frankly unprofessional and embarrassing .
neutral	city_link are the problem delivery wise without them i am certain we wouldn_'_t need to put in claims or call for assistance in tracking items .
neutral	without them we wouldn_'_t know about the lengthy procedure of locating a parcel .
neutral	they have delivered our orders to addresses the other end of the country to where they are supposed to be , lost packages completely and left goods unsigned for out in the rain .
neutral	city_link in our_minds provide a completely_unacceptable service , and unfortunately reflect badly upon yourselves .
neutral	when you pay £ 0 . 0 for a next_day delivery you expect to have your parcel the next_day .
neutral	but the transporter said he was struggling to find my address and after more than a week - and because i did call the transporter today to complain !- i got it !
neutral	the transporter guy told me he didn_'_t have the full address on his scanner so he couldn_'_t find me .
neutral	but i '_m happy with the products and rajapack i '_ve always replied to my emails promptly .
neutral	so if they change their transporter it would be all good !
neutral	the courier had dropped_off my parcel a good distance to where i live , and didn_'_t do the decent thing by posting me a notice card informing_me about the parcel , which_resulted_in me calling customer_services to check if its been dispatched .
neutral	was inconsiderate on the couriers behalf .
neutral	i find the on line parking booking very frustrating - when i try to book parking and fast track together - only the fast track is accepted .
neutral	i then have to go in and book the parking again using a different credit / debit_card and it is then accepted .
neutral	there is no way to feed_back this issue to edinburgh_airport .
neutral	other than that i find the parking costs good value for money .
neutral	seems fine to me .
neutral	not an expert on these sort of sites but it doesn_'_t offend me .
neutral	i gave topcashback a go because i was becoming a little dis - enamoured with one of its main_competitors .
neutral	unfortunately i am not sold enough to stay with it and i have defected back to my old home .
neutral	tcb is ok , but its tracking is hit and miss , and when you put in a claim , you may as well kiss goodbye to hearing about that ever again .
neutral	i put in a claim for an untracked transaction in december and then over 0 . 0_months later received confirmation that the claim had been submitted to the retailer .
neutral	i know that this is not standard for that retailer having used them with the other competitor website .
neutral	another bug_bear of mine is the tip jar .
neutral	i find it tacky .
neutral	i understand that they are a cashback provider in comparison to others but if they can '_t run on their own business model , then perhaps they should start charging .
neutral	basically , it '_s ok but nothing to write home about .
neutral	i have been a member of quidco since 0000 and was very loyal until recently .
neutral	over the past year or so cashback doesn_'_t track automatically with many retailers ( yes i clear my cookies , etc etc ) and then when a claim is submitted they take_forever to be sent to the retailer .
neutral	in addition to this , many tracked cashback transactions sit on my account for months - way beyond the average time indicated by quidco .
neutral	the only way these old transactions seem to get dealt_with is if i chase them , then magically they start moving and in some cases are paid on the next payment run .
neutral	this seems wrong , basically implying that unless we chase , the money is going to stay with quidco .
neutral	lastly , the customer service , whilst fast , is not as efficient as it used to be .
neutral	it is clear - as with most growing companies - that they want you to avoid contacting the customer service team , but when you do they respond well within the allotted_time given at the stage of submission , but more often than not with a standard response .
neutral	" we are sorry that your cashback with **** is taking longer_than_expected ...." frustrating .
neutral	i fully understand that cashback is never guaranteed , but having experienced an outstanding service for about 0 years , this past year has left me wanting and i have to admit i have defected , not fully , but in part to a competitor site .
neutral	only time will tell if they are any better , or worse , than quidco .
neutral	very good service .
neutral	easy to order and quick to deliver .
neutral	i am thrilled to have joined the modern way of purchasing , but ..........
neutral	this heavy product was delivered by one man only .
neutral	luckily i am on the ground_floor .
neutral	i persuaded him to help me unpack it and manoeuvre it into place , although , as he told me , it was not his job .
neutral	i am in my seventies , living on my own , it would have been helpful not to be faced with the prospect of dealing_with the unpacking of this large heavy package on my own , not to mention having to cut up the cardboard and manhandle the packaging to the local tip !
neutral	the problem i had was from the delivery company - it was a nightmare .
neutral	shame as i was pleased with service from store and very happy with product .
neutral	i have used beauty_bay a lot for specific products i cannot buy elsewhere .
neutral	i usually pay the £ 0 . 00 to upgrade the delivery and get some free_samples , the samples are great size and quality for the price and i really enjoy getting them .
neutral	however , should there be any problem with an order where i need to contact customer_services the response is extremely slow and on my most_recent order i had to return a faulty item and the returns_label provided was for a very slow postage speed and now 00 days after_posting the return i still have not received a replacement for the faulty item , there is no update on my account to even let_me know the faulty item has_been received and after a further email to customer_services i am still_awaiting a response .
neutral	you can find any kind of brush you ' re looking for , any shape and size , but unfortunately , especially for the small brushes , i found the quality a bit low .
neutral	the bristles were cut asymmetrically ( not meant to be !)
neutral	and some hair came off .
neutral	the bigger brushes were fine , good even , but the small ones were a bit weak .
neutral	i '_m not sure_whether i '_ll buy again .
neutral	service was great and fast but this was the first time i had bought paper_bags and i found them really thin for my needs so i '_m having to double up which makes them twice as expensive !
neutral	before buying again i would ask for a sample .
neutral	the colour of the tissue_paper was a lot brighter than appeared on screen .
neutral	i wanted a pale sage and got a pale lime_green .
neutral	i bought 000 card wine bottle neck tags from wineware .
neutral	they arrived quickly in good condition .
neutral	however the card is very thin and for the price of £_00 . 00 , plus £ 0 . 00 for postage , my purchase was poor value for money .
neutral	the service received was very good .
neutral	however , when trying to fit pole , it was very loose in the middle on the join .
neutral	we had to adapt it with cardboard and tape .
neutral	had i not had such a problem to find such a large pole , i would have returned it .
neutral	good site to skim over to get a brief idea of places , restaurants and things to do but a lot of reviews on there aren_'_t great or true to the place in my experience !
neutral	would be good if you could book cheap parking with less_than 00_hours notice
neutral	sales was ok but he didn_'_t like the fact that i knew_exactly_what i didn_'_t want - furnature polish etc .
neutral	delivery guys were first_class .
neutral	we were not in and requested left with neighbour .
neutral	you duly left a card but with the wrong neighbour '_s house number on it
neutral	my opticiam is cheaper so i will be going back to them unless groupon has another offer .
neutral	i '_m very pleased with the products received .
neutral	some articles were out of stock at time of delivery , but i was refunded rapidly .
neutral	however , when i opened my parcel there were two broken bottle of sauce !
neutral	exciting but not very many wins
neutral	the villa was well_equipped and clean .
neutral	the location is too far to walk into playa_blanca although there are shops and restaurants within a 0 min_walk .
neutral	our pool was green with algae and when tested by villa_plus , had no chlorine in it at all .
neutral	it took several days to get the pool functioning again ....
neutral	preventing this in the first place would have been preferable but we had to instigate a pool clean when the pool looked cloudy .
neutral	not a great experience with this villa company for the second time and won_'_t use again .
neutral	i '_ve contacted probikekit to query delivery and they haven_'_t got back to me today ( yet ).
neutral	product arrived later than_expected .
neutral	had paid the £ 0 . 00 for premium service .
neutral	product arrived day after it should have done and did not contain the free sample that is all part of the ' premium service '.
neutral	emailed customer_services and received a reply apologising for non delivery and told it would be received soon - clearly my email had not been read properly and some generic_response sent by way of appeasement .
neutral	still_waiting for sample product .
neutral	i ordered billynomates for my pup but got an_email to say the product is temporarily_out of stock and still has not been dispatched .
neutral	i would have liked the web_page to have been uptodate re stock_availability as there are alternative suppliers .
neutral	i needed the product urgently and feel let_down .
neutral	the email explaining the situation was helpful .
neutral	i ordered tulips but other flowers were delivered .
neutral	these aren , t always the cheapest !
neutral	i have found similar offers for cheaper x
neutral	long_stay parking at_stansted is fairly reasonable for the price although booking way in_advance secures the best cost .
neutral	however if you miss a bus .. it '_s a fairly long wait for the next one ( 00_minutes in theory ) - not helpful when you have experienced road delays and are pushed for time .
neutral	coming_back - another wait and then a hike around various car_parks with ours last .
neutral	yes it '_s cheap - yes it works but for someone as impatient as myself , not something i '_m rushing to repeat .
neutral	somehow i ended_up paying twice after having bought and entered my voucher_code with printerpix .
neutral	it took a couple of phone_calls to sort_out , and was in the end .
neutral	finished canvas looks good but i '_m wary_about buying through_groupon again
neutral	a couple more stems would have made it look fuller .
neutral	i really wouldn_'_t bother , i know some people find it brilliant , but not me !
neutral	on the whole we were pleased with the quality of our cards , but delivery took one week via second class_post , and i paid £ 0 . 00 for each package i had delivered they both came to the same address on the same day - really not acceptable ..
neutral	l clark
neutral	it took 0 - 0 mins to load each page during checkout ..
neutral	there is absolutely nothing wrong with my broadband_speed and have used " just eat " before which i never had this problem with .
neutral	sort it out hungryhouse !
neutral	i am happy with the price and product , however i would normally expect flowers to be delivery in the morning or lunch_time however they did not arrive until around 0pm , which was very disappointing and not knowing an estimated delivery time made it even more difficult to ensure the recipient was going to be in to receive them .
neutral	as a regular customer of wightlink i feel strongly that their customer service has certainly left the building . these days i tend to use the catamaran service more than the car ferry . recently knowing i was short for time i ran the length of ryde pier in the hope of catching the catamaran . arriving by their clock 0 minutes before time . the policy is that 0 minutes before boarding the gate will close . fair_enough , yet a young_man leapt over the barrier and they let him on , me well i being older couldn_'_t leap but was right behind him the gate was still open , but they refused to let_me go on board . ok so i had to wait another hour , but what really annoyed me was that when i tried to speak to the man who had let the young fella on , he walked off whilst i was speaking to him . ok i waited the hour for the next boat . then recently i wanted to take a car over . fares were advertised at from £_00 . 00 for a day return . i tried to book a low priced fare , knowing i had seen these fares on the website only a couple of days before . now i am being quoted between £_00_-£_00 . 00 , i then took myself to the office , only to be told yes i thought the same thing . i sent a complaint , no response . i rang and spoke to someone more senior , he said well thats all there is . yes i said but it says from £_00 . 00 and i had seen that on your website only 0_days before , yes well there are only the expensive fares came the response . i sent another complaint and still no response . from southampton redfunnel are advertising fares at £_00 . 00 and they are delivering that price . i would like very much to support my home town of portsmouth . yet i think wightlink are too cocky by half and becoming seriously over priced . how do they expect the everyday person to visit family .
neutral	or people that need to work and use the ferry and their firm doesn_'_t pay the fare . this cost of the service is crippling to people and some should put some thought into a fair service . i try hard to visit my grandchildren as often as possible but the cost is proving to much and will limited how often i can now go over .
neutral	website very well_laid_out and easy to browse , loved all the videos of the clothes being modelled .
neutral	i bought a pair of union_jack leggings which looked great on the model and at a total of £_00 inc_vat & delivery , i expected them to be of good quality .
neutral	unfortunately , they are made of very thin cotton and are therefore not particularly flattering even_though i am a size 00 .
neutral	i guess i expected more of leggings costing this much , and i will probably return them even_though i need something for a themed_party this weekend .
neutral	good communication and flowers were nice but were covered in the paper and being a funeral nothing could be done .
neutral	the flowers were tightly_packed and all the roses were on one side - not well displayed .
neutral	the label was not secure so fell_off and was jammed inside the paper so no one knew who they were from .
neutral	probably would have been ok if they were give to someone but they were sent to a funeral home so i feel they could have been better done .
neutral	i ordered my small fish reefs on sunday_afternoon , it showed on system that they were in stock and as i was in desperate_need of them i chose this company , it is now thursday and they are have still not even been dispatched , i know its not as bad as some problems you get with buying on line but i do spend a lot of time buying stuff on line and in my experience , some shop that have items in stock have a 0 - 0 day dispatch time .
neutral	i have emailed the company and they did reply with in couple of hours to say that item will be getting dispatch end of this week so will be with me 0 - 0 working_days after this .. so tuesday 0_days after i ordered it .
neutral	great speedy service .
neutral	the blind works well and is a fantastic colour .
neutral	i '_m not very happy with the trim though , it '_s not very straight and doesn_'_t look neat where it is stuck on .
neutral	i also would have preferred it to be on the bottom bar rather_than just above it .
neutral	would still recommend to friends though .
neutral	this is the first time that i have used this service . i was very disappointed that i was unable to phone the company --- the line was just dead despite them putting the number on the site !
neutral	i needed to inform them as i had to change my instruction for delivery .
neutral	the recipient had just moved and obviously didn_'_t know any one to leave the flowers with , . i wanted to contact the company to ask them to leave them in a cupboard . i ended_up emailing but they didn_'_t get back to me . however it all turned_out okay in the end .
neutral	after my order had gone_through i was informed my item was out of stock & it would be back in stock in two_weeks .
neutral	after two_weeks & 0_days i had heard_nothing so i sent an_email .
neutral	i received 0 replies on the two following days & my item arrived after 0_weeks & five days .
neutral	on the whole not bad service but i should have been kept_updated immediately after the two_weeks .
neutral	when i called the lady wasn_'_t all that helpful , and she seemed like she didn_'_t want to be there .
neutral	the order took 0_days to get to me but that might not of been there fault .
neutral	but there products were good that '_s the main_thing !
neutral	i had a card last_year when parking at birmingham to say i was due 00_%_off
neutral	future_bookings but was unable to do so .
neutral	ordered a bottle of tanqueray for my husbands christmas_present .
neutral	had a confirmation_email to confirm it was being_processed and that the tracking_info would follow
neutral	had no idea when it was arriving or whether it had been dispatched because the tracking email didn_'_t get sent to me until the morning after it was delivered !!!
neutral	not very helpful :(
neutral	after ordering guitars from 0 separate companies , the rush and stress of trying to make christmas as perfect as possible for all the family i made a mistake by posting a bad_review for this company instead of the other company involved in not supplying the items ordered .
neutral	my apologies .
neutral	however , the ' courtesy_call ' i received regarding the mistaken bad_review for normans was actually less_than courteous asking me to remove it .
neutral	so , initial ordering / receiving of hoods was actually gone but then somewhat spoilt by attitude that followed .
neutral	i noticed other reviews also comment on this too .
neutral	shame really .
neutral	i paid 0k for minimal improvement in my sight , very disappointed .
neutral	after one year going to start needing glasses again .
neutral	too keen to get my money than really explain this could happen .
neutral	service has_been super after my issues appeared after op but non the less i now have to start paying for glasses again after 00 weeks !
neutral	ordered this new variety of strawberry having seen a program about it on t . v .
neutral	the plants arrived promptly and were well_packaged .
neutral	they were small but this was to be expected .
neutral	i immediately potted them up into 0 " pots and put them on the patio .
neutral	hoping lots of new growth will start in spring .
neutral	can '_t really award stars till i see how they perform .
neutral	unfortunately the courier company used by viovet - city_link - i have found is not particularly customer friendly .
neutral	my last delivery i have had to cancel .
neutral	when the delivery was made i was out and although the driver claimed that he left a card i could not find it and the rescheduling of the delivery was not possible because i would be unavailable to receive it .
neutral	returning it to viovet has_been more costlier than i could have imagined .
neutral	this is not the first time i have experienced problems with a delivery by city_link .
neutral	sadly i no_longer feel able to order from viovet .
neutral	unfortunately the flowers the flowers did not look like they had been arranged and did not come in the bouquet style or finishing as in the picture .
neutral	which is the main_reason_why i chose this bunch .
neutral	so sadly disappointing : 0 (
neutral	my order arrived quickly however i had trouble using the capsules at first and sent two emails to the fine_coffee_club for their help but received no response .
neutral	i now realise it was my mistake as i need to pull the lever on the machine much harder with these capsules than with the nespresso_capsules in order for them to work .
neutral	product fine , however , delivery took two_weeks !
neutral	i '_ve_used shopto . net for quite a while now and i '_m a gold member , they used to be excellent , but it seems that recent changes have them neglect their old values of customer_care when an issue arises .
neutral	their recently added shoptonews section seems to be a copy and paste of other gaming sites news and the reviews are mediocre to say the least .
neutral	their blog used to be more reliable
neutral	the day of the treatment was good but within a few_days i was in a lot of pain .
neutral	my eyesight was blurry for several weeks , much worse_than it was before .
neutral	i was not expecting this as the first time i had it done it was clear within a few hours to days .
neutral	the pain was very severe , but only lasted a day this was the 00_hours after the contact_lens was taken out .
neutral	overall the result has_been achieved to within . 0 of being perfect , but i wasn_'_t expecting such severe pain even_though it did only last for one day - about 0_days after the op .
neutral	i was very worried for several weeks as my eyesight was a lot worse before it started to get better .
neutral	that said it did become clear after about 0_weeks .
neutral	only use if i cannot buy from a shop and deliver as i feel the quality is inferior .
neutral	although interflora really is only the middle_man the quality depends on where the sprays are made up .
neutral	normally buy toiletries as they sell top brand at a lot less .
neutral	sometimes find a bargain .
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of fit_flops one beige and one black i opened the brown cardboard_box and inside a lovely bright_red box_containing my beige pair of fitflops tried them on and fit like a glove
neutral	opened the next cardboard_box and a plastic_bag containing my black fitflops such dissappointment as i wanted to keep them nice until the summer .
neutral	the delivery firm did a good job but they are contracted for kerbside drop only .
neutral	this gave problems to pensioner customer incapable of lifting heavy goods thankfully
neutral	driver co - operated well .
neutral	i was so glad i had a fellow passenger in the car to call out where i was going
neutral	i do feel the directions to the short_stay cp for the meet and greet should be clearer .
neutral	also it was pouring with rain and we got soaked going from meet and greet meeting_point to the terminal even_though the driver dropped us a bit closer .
neutral	gatwick has it right , when they meet you right outside the terminal .
neutral	only a few yards to go .
neutral	sorry luton , not the best experience for meet and greet .
neutral	it took 0_days to make a purchase once i found what i wanted to buy .
neutral	each time i got to the checkout the site froze and i was returned to the home page !
neutral	on my third_attempt i managed to ccomplete the purchase in less_than 0 minutes .
neutral	i sent 0 emails about the problems i was having and only had a reply 0_days after i had received my goods !
neutral	to be fair this was about 00 days before christmas when internet_shopping was probably extra busy .
neutral	i emailed tooled_up as i was unhappy with part of my order .
neutral	it was broken and i was unhappy with it .
neutral	my email was never replyed to .
neutral	if you are interested in our views please respond to our outstanding complaint made on the 00st_october
neutral	the postage charge for a replacement item was taken out of my bank_account before i had been notified the original returned goods had been received and the replacement item was on its way .
neutral	an e_mail telling_me the replacement goods were on their way arrived the day after the goods were delivered .
neutral	however , prompt service and queries were answered politely and efficiently .
neutral	would use the company again .
neutral	lenses were shown in stock .
neutral	ordered the saturday , said would be dispatched the tuesday .
neutral	took 00 days to arrive .
neutral	the boots were delivered within a day of ordering .
neutral	unfortunately they were a little tight and i had to return them , also very easy .
neutral	i am now waiting for my replacement pair , as yet i have not been contacted .
neutral	i do love the clothes ive bought jumpers , skirts and coats oh and boots , all lasted well and washed well ( appart from boots lol ) but the items are sooo pricey i usually wait for the sales
neutral	very pleased with the bikini bottoms ordered , but unfortunately the top just did not fit right ( fabric gaped at sides and did not support very well , so unfortunately i will be returning the top and ordering the bandeau version of this bikini_top instead .
neutral	excellent item with fast postage but it was a long_winded transaction on line , nearly logged off to try somewhere_else .
neutral	why not offer paypal as an_alternative payment_method .
neutral	i received my order in a reasonable time but the extra packs of hoover_bags i had ordered were not there - i received one pack when i had ordered three .
neutral	i phoned sales and the person i spoke to was very patronising - had i unpacked the whole box etc - of course i had done this before i phoned .
neutral	she was unable to help as it wasn_'_t her job nor would she put me through to customer support as they were busy - i was told the procedure was to send an_email .
neutral	they might be her procedures but i had received a delivery and paid £_00 for goods i had not received .
neutral	there was no delivery note in the box or anything in the box to say what to do if the order was incorrect so i had phoned the number i had placed the order with .
neutral	i explained my internet was not working and i was therefore unable to send an_email but was told that was the procedure and there was nothing else she could do .
neutral	i will not be using them again .
neutral	i want one of those sent a great gift , with an excellent choice on line , just need to change their courier service which really let them down .
neutral	good online purchasing experience .
neutral	resonably_priced
neutral	painful delivery experience , even_though it was out of pcspecialist '_s hand , they should know better_than to choose dhl and were not very useful when trying to chase my order up when dhl had no clue_where it was .
neutral	generally above_average product quality , however if i buy a laptop with no dead pixel guarantee , it doesn_'_t mean they should send me one that was probably rejected by someone_else the screen being so bad .
neutral	above_average technical_support line , very good friendly staff
neutral	wilted flowers which were on deaths door when they arrived .
neutral	i think this was down to how long it took for them to arrive after they left the deport .
neutral	ordering them was easy and they were delivered at the time they said that they were .
neutral	i was hugely delighted when i received my photobook .
neutral	i chose the glossy_paper and was very pleased with the quality .
neutral	the only_reason i have not given 0_stars is that the creation software repeatedly came up with the message that some of my pages were blank , which made me quite nervous when it came to " order ".
neutral	obviously i checked them as advised and decided to order , and the photobook was produced correctly .
neutral	phew !
neutral	!
neutral	could have done with a bit more money for the phone , as it was in immaculate_condition .
neutral	but fast and easy to usem
neutral	lovely hamper although the box arrived sobbing wet and broken .
neutral	inside the box the cracker box is broken and squashed , everything else fine though .
neutral	ordering the item was simple enough but .............
neutral	when i asked to change the delivery address i got a response quick enough that i couldn_'_t as frustrate as i was about that !
neutral	the issues was not being kept in the loop regarding the situation .
neutral	it took 0_days
neutral	to finally get a response .
neutral	even when i got the it wasn_'_t as_described on the the internet .
neutral	there was no branding in the t - shirt - it could easily have been one i had purchased from primark .
neutral	i was most disappointed about this as it was a stock filler for my 00 year nephew .
neutral	thankfully i live local to a store .
neutral	as they didn_'_t have any of the t - shits i had ordered i had to exchange it for a more_expensive one which i was not happy - another added expense .
neutral	it all smells a bit off ?
neutral	i '_m_sure it can '_t be but the smell is really off putting .
neutral	excellent service and quick delivery .
neutral	communication_regarding the order was good .
neutral	however , i only liked 0 of the 0 products i ordered , so the beef_casserole and the beef meatballs went into the bin .
neutral	the lamb_casserole was quite likeable once i got past the initial strong herby aroma .
neutral	i would love if you could create a gluten_free suet dumpling to have with homemade stews , gf desserts like the old sara lee doubke chocolate gateaux and a gf battered fish , chips & mushy peas ready_meal !
neutral	i was offered a 00_%_discount from serenata by email .... but the difficulty i encountered when i tried to use it !
neutral	i used their function for assistance twice and was sent 0 emails apologising and offering me a 00_%_discount .
neutral	everything automated and no help at all !!
neutral	!
neutral	i understand from the recipient of the bouquet , that the flowers are superb .
neutral	no wonder , at 0rd time of trying i got the code accepted and the 00_%_discount , so ordered a more_expensive bunch !
neutral	ive not had a problem with pharmacy0u before now , but on this occasion i ordered some important goods which were shown as available yet i have had an_email from the company saying that they are awaiting stock .
neutral	if i had known this at the time i could have purchased elsewhere .
neutral	as it is i gave had to buy some more from another_supplier which i didn_'_t want to do .
neutral	the website should clearly state if there is a wait or goods are not available at the current time .
neutral	did not arrive on the expected day .
neutral	spoke to kwik - fit who told us they had had staffleave and no - one to cover area .
neutral	fitter rang next_day but said he could not come when we wanted but after_speaking to kwik - fit again he arrived and fitted the tyres .
neutral	not had problem before , prices are competetive and it is great that a fitter comes to you rather_than hanging_around at a draughty tyre depot !
neutral	website is not easy to use .
neutral	do not understand_why all clothing is split between brands and then into different sections .
neutral	would rather see all skirts and tops together .
neutral	it is very difficult to see what goes together as an outfit when they are split like that .
neutral	other tennis clothing websites are much_better at displaying the products , but the price is much_better here hence i continue to use this site .
neutral	i also spoke to staff a few_months_ago who said that when ' new ' is next to an item , you would expect out of stock sizes to be available again , however , this is not the case .
neutral	please can you make it clear when the items are fully out of stock and you do not expect more , the website is very misleading .
neutral	took two_weeks to arrive , but i saved about a pound .
neutral	i think i '_ll use somewhere with faster shipping and pay the extra next time .
neutral	a very good experience on the whole .
neutral	the only_negative_comment is regarding delivery arrangements when dfs office staff just didn_'_t seem to appreciate that if they are charging £_00 for delivery then the customer gets to say when they want the furniture delivered .
neutral	having said that they did eventually agree to a specific afterrnoon ( rather_than a specific day ) and the drivers were extremely efficient , professional and friendly
neutral	my personal_message was not included with the delivery .
neutral	it was only that i called my father and he asked me if i had sent it .
neutral	gift message for this order
neutral	from : julie emmerson
neutral	to : peter emmerson
neutral	message :
neutral	dear dad , happy birthday .
neutral	lots of love julie xxxx
neutral	animed have a repeat order facility which i thought would be a good idea as i always forget to reorder in time .
neutral	when the reorder date came round i wasn_'_t sent a reminder before hand and i got an_email at 00 . 00 on the due date .
neutral	i still had plenty left so sent an_email asking them to suspend the order .
neutral	i received an_email to say that it was suspended , but then it was delivered a few_days_later .
neutral	animed need to send a reminder out a few_days before the due date so that you can decide_whether to have the order or not .
neutral	my only_gripe is that it takes too long to arrive .
neutral	the prices are also inflated then shows a large discount to bring it back down to what is still more_expensive then most sites .
neutral	i ordered because i was given an extra discount .
neutral	the products that arrived were good , but 0 small packs of table_confetti missing from order
neutral	i placed the order on 00th_january - it is now 0st february and i have not received it yet !!!
neutral	!
neutral	booked in two tires janie very helpful have me price match due to fantastic service from him the fitter and guy on the customer service team i decided to book in for te other two tires - i spoke to a lady_who confirmed yes you will get price match same price all booked in didnt get any confirmation_email phoned back to only find out she had over charged me waiting on call back to restore my faith in using again shame that the lady didnt check the details properly as first time service fantastic
neutral	the flowers themselves were lovely and definitely great value for money but they were not as expected .
neutral	they resembled a christmas bouquet despite not looking like that on site - ie .
neutral	deep reds , gypsofelia covered in glitter .
neutral	also , despite the message clearly stating ' get well soon ' - the card selected for the message said ' happy birthday '.
neutral	thankfully the colleague_who these were sent to saw the funny side but a bit_disappointing for a first time out with this company .
neutral	if you are going to shop_here go well prepared , know what you are after and dont worry if it seems you are asking silly_questions .
neutral	beware the staff are not pc trained they are only sales people so will say and do whatever it takes to make a sale so take care .
neutral	ordered a trophy for a family competition .
neutral	the choice was great and on arrival the trophy was just as expected and engraving was correct .
neutral	and neat .
neutral	my only_gripe was that at check out i was placed as living in " the highlands and islands ".
neutral	i live only 00 miles north of glasgow and am in central_scotland .
neutral	the postal firms do not charge extra to deliver to where i live so i don_'_t understand_why i was charged extra .
neutral	the book took hours to create as it kept freezing and crashing .
neutral	then it wouldn_'_t save or it muddled up all the photographs and had to be redone several_times .
neutral	so difficult to get it done i would not get another .
neutral	it is a shame as the quality is very good .
neutral	the ' hold it ' book / laptop stand is good , well built , easy to use and not too obtrusive when not in use but after_placing the order we then found it '_s also being sold by amazon nearly_£_00 cheaper !
neutral	yes the same item made by the same people yet £_00 cheaper .
neutral	we queried this with complete_care shop and got no sensible answer , they didn_'_t want to discuss it . disappointed !
neutral	the website is easy to use with a good selection of products .
neutral	the rug i bought was really good quality for a good price .
neutral	the problem i had was not being_able to order a swatch for the rug i wanted to buy which_meant i just had to take a risk .
neutral	although the rug was a lovely colour it didn_'_t quite match so would '_ve liked to have returned it .
neutral	however , their returns_policy_states the costumer has to pay for the postage which of course would be very expensive on a large rug .
neutral	therefore i am stuck with a rug i don_'_t want because sending it back wouldn_'_t benefit me monetary wise .
neutral	a shame reall because the rest of the service and delivery was good
neutral	i ordered weaving thread in brown , after paying extra for next_day delivery , the thread i actually received was blonde in colour , which wasn_'_t suitable for the task but as it was an_emergency job i had to use it .
neutral	the thread is of great quality just annoying the correct colour wasn_'_t sent .
neutral	the ordering process could not have been simpler and the delivery and the correspondence around the delivery was excellent .
neutral	however , the goods themselves were a little_disappointing and this would prevent me from using this service again .
neutral	flowers as_described , although next_day delivery did not happen until_0pm .
neutral	on a couple of occasions , i have thought that i had earned cashback , having fulfilled all the criteria for the particular offer .
neutral	however , these amounts have subsequently been declined , with no explanation .
neutral	i have just received a reply from your customer_services department , thank_you for getting back to me eventually .
neutral	if the full_amount is refunded as promised , i will_continue using your services in the future and increase the rating of my review as it clearly shows you care about your customers .
neutral	well , to be fair , plasticboxshop is the only company in the known universe to make and sell the square water buckets i urgently_needed .
neutral	also to be fair , they dealt_with my order immediately .
neutral	alas , they sent the wrong items , sending bog_standard round ones that i could have got anywhere .
neutral	their returns_procedure is difficult to follow on line but i rang up and the chap was very helpful ( after some initial waffle about how busy their poor depot staff had been over christmas ).
neutral	i am advised that the delivery courier will collect the wrong items when he delivers the right ones which , if it works , is very convenient .
neutral	pity they couldn_'_t have got the order right in the first place as i '_d have given them a 00 / 00 but i have to drop this to a 0 / 00 for inattention to detail , trying to pass the blame somewhere_else and offensively e_- mailing me as dear of .
neutral	trying to pay with my fiance '_s credit_card was an issue because the card name was automatically put in as my name after entering it on a previous section and you cant change it from the login users .
neutral	so after ringing it was explained to me that it didn_'_t matter what name was written as the numbers were all that mattered .
neutral	well to start with nowhere on your site was this explained , which led to my phone_call in the first place .
neutral	secondly , after explaining to the man on the phone that the furniture was for me , somehow the items still ended_up being titled to my fiance !
neutral	the emails that were sent after purchase about the delivery , care of the products included the the longest sets of information i '_ve ever had the pleasure of reading , so thanks for that .
neutral	honestly , it was all a little ridiculous - several pages of what i was responsible for and what they were not .
neutral	probably could of waffled on a little less , but in a way i felt i had to read them in case i missed something important .
neutral	delivery was fine and thankfully a dry day so no marks on the carpet , because they are are not allowed to take their shoes off and the customer is responsible for muddy shoe prints !
neutral	therefore rugs / lining all the way up the stairs would be appropriate in wet circumstances .... hummm not sure how the hell that would work but anyway , as i said dry day for me so luck was in .
neutral	they were polite and quick though and came when they said they would so 0_* on that one thank_you .
neutral	lastly the quality of the actual furniture itself was neither well made or very solid in some places .
neutral	for example the bottoms of the drawers and back of both items , though made of oak were the thinnest pieces you could use .
neutral	there were several places in which glue had leaked from where two bits of wood had been stuck together .
neutral	the finish of the end product in some places was lacking such as underneath , i . e .
neutral	the wood was not smoothed and had flaky / spiky bits of wood stuck out .
neutral	got my stuff in a sale but would say without a doubt that it wouldn_'_t be worth full price .
neutral	however , i did not send my back because i realised i would be getting a replacement piece exactly the same and i have been unable to find anything that matches the measurements i needed except the items i bought so would not be able to find anything elsewhere either .
neutral	so for now they will do the job .
neutral	took out 0 month '_s provisional insurance with marmelade .
neutral	all ok but when i needed to make an_amendment i was initially told by customer_services it wasn_'_t possible and the advisor didn_'_t know the reason_why !
neutral	this led to frustration and wasted time .
neutral	called back again , spoke to someone more knowledgeable who understood and helped immediately advising that the first person i spoke with was wrong .
neutral	i recent ordered two_pairs of glasses .
neutral	while the service was great with no_problems , just last_week one pair of glasses broke with the screw coming out of the joint between the arm and the main body of the glasses .
neutral	i haven_'_t treated either pair badly , so am very disappointed that i now have a useless pair of glasses after such a short_period of time .
neutral	on maundy thursday i had found a florist close to my aunt '_s care home on the web_site .
neutral	after finding the flowers appropriate for sympathy after my uncle death i ordered them and paid the extra for them to be delivered that day .
neutral	in the afternoon of the same day i had a phone_call to say it was ' difficult to find anyone who could deliver them that day '.
neutral	he went on to say that the florist would not be open until saturday but would be delivered then .
neutral	i had pointed_out the additional_cost i had made to have a same day delivery and was told the bouquet would be made larger to the cost of the postage .
neutral	as i am about 000_miles_away i had no choice in what was suggested .
neutral	i must_admit i was a bit disappointed .
neutral	my dear aunt had been taken into the care home after the death of her husband and i really wanted them to be delivered as soon as possible .
neutral	bon ' aparte has wonderful clothes and accessories which prior to this order have always arrived in very good time , beautifully_wrapped and securely_packaged .
neutral	i '_m not sure if they have changed shipping companies but an order which would have arrived within 0 - 0_days previously took 00 days this time ?
neutral	customer_services were great when enquiring where my order was and the clothes were great as usual - please sort_out your deliveries !
neutral	i recommend the procedure completly painless , but the aftercare is poor .
neutral	i have had to chase my appointments all the time the pboro office closed local to me and i wasnt informed . noone conatcts me regarding after care , and this i wouldnt recomend them
neutral	correct product finally delivered and small compensation given but only after complaint .
neutral	my two_pairs of glasses arrived last_week , and althougth the frames are lovely and fit really well , i '_m not sure if the prescription is quite right ?
neutral	i uploaded my original prescription so i dont_know what could be wrong , but they just feel different to my other glasses ( bought when i got my last prescription ).
neutral	just one eye ( my left ) feels_like it might be too strong , and i end up getting a pain above that eye after wearing them for more than 00_minutes , which doesnt_happen with my older glasses !
neutral	i did think they took longer_than i expected to arrive also ( 0_weeks ) and there was no way to track them on the website although the confirmation_email gave the impression that you could , with a tracking no .
neutral	but all it said was that the order was finished and had been sent .
neutral	otherwise the site was very easy to use and to upload your_own picture to ' try on ', and the variety and range are very good .
neutral	i will_definately recommend it and consider_buying again if i can get the lens problem sorted as the price is extremely good .
neutral	:)
neutral	i bought chocolates from chocolate_trading company as a free valentine '_s day offer via_topcashback .
neutral	the chocolates arrived in time and were very nice .
neutral	however they were rather over - priced at £ 0 . 00 for a tiny box .
neutral	i also had to go through the topcashback complaints_procedure to get my refund which hadn_'_t been forwarded by the company .
neutral	good communication , delivery and price .
neutral	unfortunately some of the stems were broken so the standard / quality was not fully as expected .
neutral	it '_s very good
neutral	the mattress arrived in perfect_condition , however it arrived the day after we expected it , with no notice of the late arrival , luckily there was someone available in the house .
neutral	we had called on the second day , and been called back , with an explanation and an assurance , but it would have been better if this info had been volunteered rather_than us having to enquire .
neutral	delivery was good and on time but i specifically selected a boquet without lillies as my wife doesn_'_t like them .
neutral	doesn_'_t make me look too good when a bouquet arrives for our ( 00nd !!!)
neutral	wedding_anniversary and it '_s got lillies in does it ?
neutral	unfortunately i also got a virus on my computer after visiting the site and we had to get tech_support in to clear it .
neutral	my order of bath sheet , hand towel and facecloth arrived promptly - but was rather disappointed in the quality of the towels - they ' re just ok - not as good as the ones in your shop !
neutral	perhaps they were special ' sale quality '?
neutral	i ordered linen mats and table mats for 0 sets of friends for christmas .
neutral	after the 0nd order was placed i received a message_saying that there would be a 0 week delay .
neutral	this was in mid - december .
neutral	as i live in france i had given my friends ' address for delivery i didn_'_t even know that the items hadn_'_t been delivered and there was no further communication to say that they hadn_'_t been despatched .
neutral	when i found out at the end of january i rang urbanara who told me , correctly , that they would arrive in the 0nd week of february .
neutral	they really are lovely quality , but i am concerned that urbanara a . took payment knowing there was a delay b . failed to keep me informed c . didn_'_t seem particularly shame - faced when i phoned them .
neutral	as i had ordered 0 items for 0 different people at 0 different times i know that this wasn_'_t a one - off error .
neutral	very disappointed and would hesitate before ordering anything_else from them as a gift .
neutral	i have contacted national_helpline , they come_back to me straight_away , they were very quick to find out what i need it help with , after that i just got a letter that they want be able to take my case .
neutral	no phone_call with explanation just a letter .
neutral	felt like they only care for customers who are able to make a claim , if nothing come out of that , customers are not very important .
neutral	bags were exactly_what i wanted and the perfect size .
neutral	the only problem was the way they were packed in the box , they are counted in 00 '_s ( one bundle only had 00 ) and put top to tail which makes them flat , but when you get to the last two bundles they were squashed in the top of the box and are a bit bent around the sides .
neutral	very pleased with 00_% of orders , but true love by elzabeth arden didn_'_t seem genuine .
neutral	nothing on bottle or box saying ea .
neutral	i know it was cheap , but i did think everything would be genuine .
neutral	my mum called me to thank me for the flowers for mothers_day - her description of which was far from what i actually ordered !
neutral	my mum loves tulips so i thought i would get her a lovely big bunch of them and even paid_extra for more ..... what she received though lovely did not include even one tulip !
neutral	some lillies ( which she doesn_'_t like ) carnations , gerbera and another flower i am not sure of and greenery all in light pink hues .
neutral	it was a nice bunch of flowers but feel dissapointed that it isn_'_t what i actually bought .
neutral	i had been looking for brown buckwheat to cook in a traditional russian way for a while but could only find its green type until i came_across this site .
neutral	in the picture i could see the cooked brown buckwheat - " kasha " - as it should be , so i was looking_forward to getting it .
neutral	unfortunately , when i started cooking , i could see very soon that it was not the kind i had expected .
neutral	how to explain it to someone_who has never tried the type i used to cook in russia ?
neutral	if you know the difference_between buckwheat " sechka " and " proper " buckwheat , you will understand what i mean .
neutral	in short , if you intend to use it as additional ingredient , you will be fine .
neutral	but if you try to cook " proper russian buckwheat kasha ", you will not succeed as this is the wrong type .
neutral	i also tried one of the raw_chocolate_bars , i think , with cherries , and i found it really nice : fresh , melting , full cocoa flavour .
neutral	i also tried one of food bars , and i also really enjoyed it : it was fresh , tasty and filling .
neutral	i ordered leggings and a hat and was really pleased with the speed of delivery and being kept_informed of process of order .
neutral	the leggings are great and i wanted to order more , but stock_availability is awful .
neutral	i put several items in my shopping_basket and when i went to checkout was told that four of the five items weren_'_t in stock .
neutral	it was frustrating as i wasn_'_t going to pay p_&_p for one item and then find the others in stock later on .
neutral	their stock_availability needs to be addressed , although i am very happy with the items i '_ve managed to buy so far .
neutral	i used to sell the odd thing on ebay , but unless i list it as collection only , i usually end up out of pocket on postage , as ebay dictate the postage you can charge .
neutral	when i sold a double disc set , they would not let_me charge any more than a single disc cost .
neutral	they used to be brilliant , but feel that you really need to compare their prices before assuming that you are getting a bargain .
neutral	some of their electronics are ridiculously overpriced , when compared with other online shops .
neutral	my advice is ; don_'_t assume they are the cheapest on buy it now and do your research before you bid at auction .
neutral	i still buy at auction , but think they would like to stop auctions and just have retail_outlets on there .
neutral	if i want retail i '_ll go to the high_street .
neutral	don_'_t lose what made you unique please ebay and remember the little guy .
neutral	box arrived squashed and message crumpled but flowers intact .
neutral	delivery on time and good value .
neutral	my friends with me bought air tickets last wednesday , and they have received airline ticket number , but until now i don_'_t received , i call your customer number many_times but phone stop working .
neutral	i '_m very worry
neutral	i am happy with the protein but not the flavour .
neutral	i '_m using it but because i put it in my porridge i have to add sugar which i didn_'_t want to .
neutral	ineeded to know something about the booking i made with lowcost yesterday , so phoned the 0000 no re existing booking to be promptly informed that no agents were available and it would cost me 00p_per_minute to wait !
neutral	!
neutral	thought oh well , at first , then after almost 00_minutes of waiting ..... and much out of pocket , and in sheer frustration , called new booking line ... and , lo and behold got through straight_away ....... was not impressed i can tell you ....... what it said to me ???
neutral	we got your money now sod_off !!
neutral	thankfully the agent for new bookings was able to answer my very simple enquiry ........ but now i await an extortianate phone bill !!
neutral	thanks lowcost !
neutral	initially my add on partner paid rental_cars £_00 . 00 to hire a small car from enterprise . however when he got to enterprise they would not let him rent as he didnt have enough utility_bills to show them ( despite tv licence and aletter to him at his current address ).
neutral	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused ..... after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back ..... money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
neutral	to add_insult to injury my add on driver got fined for parking at his own workplace despite having informed the company he was in a temp hire_car and them agreeing it was ok and signing reg no in every day ... this was obviously a mistake .... fine was squashed ... however , enterprise have charged_£_00 . 00 admin_fee to my bank_account and despite agreeing if the fine was deemed wrong and squashed , i would get my admin_fee back , no such luck ..... even after several emails to the traffic violation dept ... i have heard_nothing !!
neutral	i hired this car as a goodwill_gesture for a friend ... never ever again will i help anyone out like this again ....... even_though this was not his error ... i have been charged for it and i am the only one out of pocket for doing a good deed .!!
neutral	and enterprise have received £_00 . 00 for absolutely zilch !!
neutral	how is that fair ?
neutral	no wonder they are the cheapest car_rental company around ..... thats because they make their money in other ways , obviously !
neutral	!
neutral	the tap was delivered quickly and was very nice however when i ordered the tap it didnt say that it didnt come complete with shower slide and hose .
neutral	when it arrived it was not complete .
neutral	i spoke to josh who was great and he explained that he could offer a refund as it was miss sold due to confusion with suppliers .
neutral	this is in the process of being done and tap was collected today .
neutral	thanks josh for your help and great customer service
neutral	will be visiting again
neutral	the service is great overall as it cuts_down on time wasted waiting for buses etc - however receiving my car back that had just been cleaned - the carpets in the front all muddy ( not wet !)
neutral	and in the back !
neutral	!
neutral	when driver who returned was informed couldn_'_t really explain_why all carpets in that state
neutral	i have ordered a couple things on animed , and i ordered a prescription of metacam for my dog and had a prescription to say that i could order another bottle .
neutral	when it came to order a new bottle i did and after a few_days my original metacam ran_out , followed_by an_email requesting a prescription which wasnt needed .
neutral	so by this point i had to order another , more_expensive smaller bottle of metacam to tie me over which i didnt appreciate .
neutral	i think that needs to be sorted .
neutral	service was good in that the flowers were delivered on time but they looked quite wilted when they were displayed at the funeral
neutral	tried 0 times to send 0 bouquets but ended_up having to order in to separate_orders .. entered_details , clicked continue shopping and first order was deleted .
neutral	had quite a time with my recent yodel delivery .
neutral	the tracking_information was promptly updated , i waited in for my parcel for it to never arrive !
neutral	the tracking_information was updated further on the same day and stated that we were not in and a call card had been left .
neutral	we had not left the house at any point and definitely no card had been left !
neutral	we believe they never came at all .
neutral	so we waited in on the following_day expecting it to be delivered then instead and yet again the parcel was not delivered .
neutral	this continued for the next_day too .
neutral	at this point i was very annoyed and sent an_email to customer_services , as soon as staff were back at work on monday_morning re - delivery was arranged and am pleased to say yodel have just delivered my parcel !!
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for chloe at their customer_services i would have given a much_lower rating .
neutral	the whole performance has_been quite testing .
neutral	i feel despite the best efforts of customer_services i am unable to rate them higher than three stars as if things had gone to plan in the first place it would have made my experience so much simpler .
neutral	i would give chloe herself a 0_* rating !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered samylin tablets and everything went through alright , but a 0_days_later had a phone_call advising that they were not in stock and would not be until december .
neutral	they asked if we would like to substitute the tablets for sachets , and even_though they said they were more_expensive they would not charge us anything extra .
neutral	as we were running out of tablets we had not alternative to accept the sachets as substitute .
neutral	sachets arrived a few_days_later , however they have caused us difficulties in that our pet will not eat any food with the sachets mixed through it , so we have had to go and pay a further £_000 for tablets .
neutral	my advice would be if they do not have any in stock they should state it at the time of purchase to give people a chance to find another_supplier
neutral	good delivery and love the product .
neutral	however size came up small so wanted to exchange .
neutral	had to insure the product which cost me £_00 , you shouldn_'_t be charged to make an exchange .
neutral	the delivery service used is a shambles !
neutral	i waited and waited for delivery , the said they couldn_'_t find the house and sent it back to the depot , so i had it redelivered to another address and waited in for it only for it not to turn_up and it was dropped_off at the post_office .
neutral	one woman i spoke to at the depot was brilliant and really helped_me .
neutral	but i '_m afraid i won_'_t be using you ' re service again as i cannot waste more time off work .
neutral	having run this catalogue for many_years i have seen many changes and not many of them for the good .
neutral	it used to be the sum total of your order could be spread over 00 weeks or 00 weeks , now it '_s each_individual item which can make the payments too high therefore limiting the number of items bought , so catalogue is missing out on profit .
neutral	it used to be a free phone number but now it '_s premium , which is not good as it costs a lot of money by the time all the options have been gone_through .
neutral	i know that catalogue prices have always been higher than shops but now the difference is getting far too much i . e .
neutral	ps0 in the shops £_000 in the catalogue £_000 .
neutral	£_00 is far too much of a difference .
neutral	also not getting rewards on sale items and other things is not fair on the person running the catalogue .
neutral	if items are out of stock then remove them from the on - line page or at_least mark it as " out of stock " it would be good if you could also request your cash rewards on - line as having to spend so much money in a phone_call to get it is not good enough and also the length of time it takes to get is not good .
neutral	it would be nice for long_term loyal_customers to get a wee reward or incentive as a thank_you .
neutral	sad that recipient did not know who flowers were from
neutral	when returning to collect our car it wasn_'_t nearby and took a while to locate , making us very nervous !
neutral	staff not helpful and looked very confused and flustered ( disorganised ).
neutral	had chosen for the cheap price but not sure would use again having seen car wasn_'_t parked within area .
neutral	quick delivery however although lots of bubble_wrap the box is quite dented which does not look good when it is a present
neutral	after confirming my eyesight had been stable for the required duration i decided to go for surgery after a friend of mine recommended it .
neutral	my surgery all went fine 0 years_ago with only an issue with night_vision , which i could live with .
neutral	unfortunately my short sightedness has returned so now having to get some glasses or seek another solution .
neutral	over sixty had a problem ordering on line would not accept password or whatever .
neutral	ordered over the phone and had to pay delivery .
neutral	used all the time handy tool
neutral	good when you need a lot of info
neutral	my chest of draws fell_apart within a few_weeks and was hardly used
neutral	but only because they are less pushy than phones 0 u ..... now i shop online
neutral	tried this then netflix , i think they both have their good and bad bits ,
neutral	keep sending me junk_mail but their penion is quite good
neutral	never had any isses
neutral	cant understand the labels on most of the products but they are cheap and fair quality
neutral	i found the ordering process easy enough however it wasnt made clear to me that delivery could be between_0am and 0pm until i had ordered .
neutral	i ordered a dozen_red_roses which i assumed would mean 00 ( there was nothing to say otherwise ) when in fact only 00 roses were included .
neutral	i tried to enquire when the flowers would be delivered as i didnt receive an_email with a tracking_number as was promised , only to find that there was no telephone_number to contact anyone - it had to be done by email .
neutral	the flowers were delivered and i believe the quality to have been satisfactory for the price however i doubt that i will use this service again .
neutral	i appreciate the concept of the service but over all it was just too much hassle .
neutral	overall car_hire was ok , had booked a vauxhal astra bus was given a skoda fabia far from and car that was in its " similar " group infact was in the group below but were assured as it had air_con it was a similar model .
neutral	products were a very good price , but the postage outweighs the savings .
neutral	delivery was slow , ordered 00th_march did not receive until 0nd_april , at a cost of £ 0 . 00 i think is expensive .
neutral	love my roman_blinds quality good but the cords could be stronger
neutral	whilst there are a lot of good offers on the site some of the goods i have received are of poor quality .
neutral	i also would also like to be able to track my order so i know what stage its at in the delivery .
neutral	after saying all of that i do think it '_s a great site with some really great offers .
neutral	can '_t fault the service , very helpful , kept_informed right up to receiving the goods .
neutral	goods arrived very quickly even over a bank_holiday_weekend .
neutral	i haven_'_t tried the product yet but will review it once i have .
neutral	update_:
neutral	when i put the tent up i found a fault , i arranged for the tent to go back and wanted an exchange but taunton_leisure said i had to have a repair on this brand_new tent as there were no replacement tents as they had sold out .
neutral	i agreed to the repair but after waiting a considerable number of weeks as the manufacturer was busy i became fed_up of waiting and asked for a refund .
neutral	taunton_leisure were not very helpful or completly open about the delays .
neutral	sequin dorothy_costume
neutral	i brought this costume for my daughters_birthday_party , i phoned this order through and found the girl who answered very nice and helpful , as i needed help with how the sizes are .
neutral	this order came the next_day which was brilliant .
neutral	the dress was lovely and was very happy till my daughter tried it on it was really big i brought 0 - 0 my daughter been 0 but this was very big , even thought my daughter isnt that small .
neutral	on closer in inspection it was very badly made , the back only had half velcro down the back so left a big gap , stitching was also not great , a lot of lose thread .
neutral	didnt have time to send back , so just used it with problems .
neutral	shame really as dont_think it was companys fault .
neutral	but would use company again .
neutral	i use interparcel a lot because we are not big enough yet to have a courier account ourselves .
neutral	they generally offer good value for money but i have found that unless you use the interparcel economy service for the non timed services they are pretty lax and don_'_t care if your order is not picked_up .
neutral	customer service is varied and not always particularly friendly to small fry .
neutral	they seem to say if there is a problem it '_s not their fault and it '_s up to the customer to sort it out or rebook again at extra_cost .
neutral	i use them because they offer a good variety of services at a reasonable_price but stay away from hermes or yodel .
neutral	three_times in the last 0_weeks they have failed to pick_up and then delivered my products up to a week late .
neutral	not worth the hassle .
neutral	even_though they are cheap .
neutral	they shouldn_'_t offer these services .
neutral	however on the whole when using interparcel itself i '_ve been pretty happy and still continue to use them , but this is definitely due to there being not better option out there for us at this present moment in time .
neutral	re : maxiclip floor frame by elbesee .
neutral	i have never come_across such an inadequate instruction_sheet in all my life , and i `_m 00 years old .
neutral	the frame looks good and solid , but i know that i haven_`_t put it together properly as i have a couple of washers left .
neutral	some of the parts on the sheet were so small that i had to get out my magnifying_glass .
neutral	please , please , consider us poor mortals who struggle with ` flat packs ` etc .
neutral	and give us some decent instructions .
neutral	anyway , thanks for giving me the opportunity to get this gripe off my chest !
neutral	they seem to like to blame website for pricing , offers inconsistencies .
neutral	i ordered a laptop and wireless adapters / extenders should have been free but even_though free on website £_00 added in checkout .
neutral	had to cancel order .........
neutral	another time order accepted , no product arrived and on phoning them , they said my card_details were incorrect , even_though they stored them on their system from previous_orders and i have used them again since ..........
neutral	but price was not honoured as offer had finished when i contacted them to find out where my laptop was ........
neutral	initially the process started off well , we were told more or less straight_away that we had been accepted .
neutral	our information required was sent by fax and we were told that it was all ok and our account would be sent to payment .
neutral	our point of contact then went on annual_leave , that '_s where the stress started .
neutral	i requested call_backs to explain where we were at , but 0 out of 00 times that never happened .
neutral	every time i phoned up i had to explain the whole situation yet again .
neutral	finally five days_later our account went to payment and was told that payment would go through by the end of the day .
neutral	the accounts / payment then phoned me to say that they had the incorrect paper_work and that it was too late to proceed that day .
neutral	all week i had phoned and every_single person had told me that all the paperwork was correct .
neutral	if it had been picked_up earlier we could have processed earlier .
neutral	our car dealer was very stressed out with the situation as were we .
neutral	i sent all the info again , but our weekend was ruined .
neutral	the lady in payments was very supportive .
neutral	unfortunately due to the stress of it all i broke_down in tears , she helped to console me .
neutral	our advisor was wonderful and helped_me a lot .
neutral	finally the following_monday everything went through and we picked_up our car .
neutral	we love our new car :)
neutral	on the whole the service receieved was good .
neutral	however , although we were told where to meet the operator upon our return , signs to the relevant car_park at stanstead were not good , and we were waiting in the wrong place .
neutral	a simple sketch on the printout would have made things much clearer .
neutral	cartridges ok but took over a week to be delivered !
neutral	service - nil points !
neutral	options allowed me to email and check / verify the colour that both day and evening_invitations were cream .
neutral	quick feedback given .
neutral	card used - medium to good quality - not very thick .
neutral	felt text had a glittery effect to it that u couldn_'_t make out on website perhaps it should state this somewhere , as on first_glance looks like printer was running out of ink . fairly good value for money .
neutral	not bad would reccomend tho
neutral	good but could of been better
neutral	i prefere i phone
neutral	i don_'_t really like to shop in tesco although there fruit and veg is good , but i have found horrible bits of meat in pasta pots ect and there was an orange fly in a packet of crisps i brought in a meal deal .
neutral	the produce is not worth the money and its very exspensive you dont get your_moneys worth .
neutral	i did have problems with the actual products but the customer service was excellent .
neutral	it took me ages to find a pair of glasses i liked and then ordered two_pairs which arrived in slightly_different frame sizes !
neutral	there was only one available of the size which suited me , and which came according to the measurements on the website , but all their other pairs back at the factory were 0 mm smaller in width so i had to compromise and choose another style which i didn_'_t like as much .
neutral	the customer service assistants did their best to help .
neutral	was disappointed with the service .
neutral	my order was triplicated .
neutral	unfortunately the size was wrong .
neutral	the larger one was out of stock .
neutral	i had to make a series of phone_calls which have cost at_least £ 0 , 00 as the phone line is a premium_rate one .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	placed online order on the 00th_april , in the hope that it might work like [_external_reference_], and arrive within a couple of days .
neutral	but , it took until the 00th to arrive .
neutral	too long , i think .
neutral	ordering was easy , and the dualit_toaster i ordered is brilliant !!
neutral	my only_grumble is it took over two_weeks from ordering to delivery with no explanation !!
neutral	i would order again because the price was very good , but only if i was in no hurry to receive my ordered items !
neutral	!
neutral	good service but unfortunately delivered to another address without putting a card in for me to tell me where it was
neutral	i '_m really enjoying all the exante products and have lost a total of 00 pounds in 0_weeks .
neutral	i have two gripes though :
neutral	- i was sent totally the wrong products in my second order .
neutral	it was as if the order had not been checked at all before being dispatched .
neutral	the invoice within the box was correct , but the products were not .
neutral	although this was resolved within a few_days , it was very inconvenient and frustrating .
neutral	- you do not get any type of information booklet with your first order .
neutral	i think this is really stingy actually !
neutral	information is available to download from the website , but when you ' re paying £_000_+ for a 0 week course or products , i would expect some written information about the diet and indeed coming off the diet to be included in the price .
neutral	so all in all , the diet works and the products are nice i just think that some improvements could be made to customer service .
neutral	the products arrived but sadly one was damaged .
neutral	now was the the van_driver or not ?
neutral	see above note .
neutral	my order has not yet arrived so i am unable to give an accurate review .
neutral	although i have used animed_direct for ages and delivery has always been a bit_slower_than other_suppliers , i allow for this when ordering .
neutral	however on the last order , funds were taken from my account on the day of ordering but goods were not despatched for a further week , despite_being told that if this could not take place within three_days i would be notified , this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	i was impressed with how quickly the package was delivered and the cost was so much_cheaper , but when it was delivered the box it came in was damaged and the contents boesx was all damaged and open .
neutral	when i saw on your site that it was free_postage if you spent over_£_00 . 00 .
neutral	i made sure it was nearer £_00 . 00 , but when i came to the checkout , it was charing me postage .
neutral	i got my order the next_day , which was great .
neutral	there was one item missing , so i phoned up and the lady seemed very helpful and said she would send the missing item on that day , i also asked about the postage .
neutral	she explained that you have to pull a drop down_menu to get this , but when you have only just started_using the computer you don_'_t always see these things .
neutral	i have not got my missing item yet .
neutral	i am abit disappointed with your site now , which is a shame as i am in a wheelchair , so i don_'_t get to go shopping much .
neutral	i liked alot of items on your site , but i don_'_t think i will shop with you any more , as i think you could have refunded my postage because of the amount i spent and the missing item .
neutral	i had to really think about buying from here as the delivery was £_00 . 00 !!
neutral	so although it appears to be a good bargain for items once you add on the delivery charge on , it '_s pretty_much as such .
neutral	i was able to choose delivery date , but in the small_print it did state that if no one was home to take delivery , you could be charged the same again to re - deliver .
neutral	so i stayed in all day and it didn_'_t arrive !
neutral	did come the following_day however , and was very pleased with my purchase , a tap and loo_roll holder .
neutral	would i order again ?
neutral	possibly .
neutral	i order two of the same kind of arrangements , and wanted them to be delivered to my own address .
neutral	when florist came they only had one , i queried it with them but they only had an order for 0 .
neutral	phoned the helpline , lady was very nice and helpful .
neutral	i was told they thought it was an_error , although i wasn_'_t contacted or prompted when ordering to check this .
neutral	i did get the second bunch but from a different florist , so although ordered 0 of the same they were completely_different .
neutral	also charged for 0 deliveries .
neutral	don_'_t think i would use them again .
neutral	ordered a pasta_maker baking , pans and small glass teapot .
neutral	pasta_maker very good already used it and made great pasta .
neutral	the pans are fine and good quality , but glass tea_pot not up to much . the strainer is solid at the bottom so the leaves are left in water instead of draining out .
neutral	shame it spoilt the item for me .
neutral	delivery was prompt but parcel was damaged at the bottom and the delivery driver put it on the floor without telling us it was open so it looked fine until we picked it up and found the bottom open .
neutral	luckily nothing was damaged or missing .
neutral	the sunglasses i bought were the same price as they were at the airport , which is really good .
neutral	however , when i received the sunglasses one of the sides was loose , so i had to put some glue to repair it .
neutral	i ordered 0 bouquets to be delivered on 00 dec . only one was delivered on 00rd .
neutral	other was delivered on 00th .
neutral	the shoes i ordered were meant to be white but were a horrible cream colour , then i had to pay recorded post to return them ... so not very happy
neutral	the tablet cover was delivered in the wrong_colour despite the enclosed invoice being correct .
neutral	i had to return it for exchange at a cost to me of £ 0 .
neutral	i would have expected this cost to be re - imbersed by the seller .
neutral	however , i did receive the correct cover by return of post .
neutral	first and foremost i am very pleased with my car and the deal and i would use nationwide again .
neutral	however , the transaction was not without it '_s problems ( albeit minor ).
neutral	i originally enquired wanting a vehicle available under the fast lease scheme as i needed a car pronto and made this very clear .
neutral	after 0 week it turned_out the car and the deal advertised on the webiste was no_longer available and i was told the deal should have been removed from the webiste weeks_ago ( it is still on there today !).
neutral	having said this my advisor went to great lengths to source me the same car from a dealer and honored the original deal which i found very satisfying .
neutral	after i had accepted the quote and paid the processing fee , communication did go quiet but i was told i '_d have my car within 0 - 0_weeks which was super as mentioned_above , i really needed a car quickly !
neutral	however , once the admin_team got in touch and sent all the paperwork through it became very apparent that this timescale was not accurate .
neutral	the car infact took 0_weeks to just reach the supplier , i then had to wait 00 working_days for a cooling_off period before the car could be delivered to me .
neutral	this meant the whole_process from first point of contact to the car landing on my driveway took 0_weeks .
neutral	now this would normally have not been an issue at all if only i had been given the correct information and had i not needed a car quickly .
neutral	i feel management of expectations is important here as is customer service ; communication was excellent right up until i paid my deposit ( another sale , commission in back pocket , onto the next ).
neutral	i have to say the admin_team and lorraine in particular were brilliant , answered all my questions / emails promptly .
neutral	now , the car is here , i am very very happy , the vehicle is lovely and spotless throughout .
neutral	flowers arrived on time although a smaller bouquet that i was expecting .
neutral	ordered on a tues as i needed it for friday_night .
neutral	when they didn_'_t arrive by friday_afternoon i had to drive to a shopping centre to buy alternatives to use on a client .
neutral	they arrived saturday_morning , but my invoice stated it had been due for delivery on the thursday .
neutral	the driver must have had a couple of days off !
neutral	internet system seemed efficient and booking was straightforward but when an alteration was to be considered no one responded to my e_- mail via my account for over a month despite 0 or 0 e_- mail and 0 telephone_calls , it was only at the second telephone_call i was provided with the required infomation .
neutral	as any other monopoly , having stock that other_sites don_'_t have , they set the prices of knives ( usually high ) and despite 0 years of regular expensive purchases , cumulating to above 0000 £ when kindly asked of a coupon ( that they otherwise offer monthly to certain magazines readers ) they didn_'_t offer one .
neutral	seems that loyal_customer appreciation is not part of the company policy .
neutral	next time i will buy elsewhere if possible and support the business of smaller , and perhaps kinder sellers .
neutral	they did not publish one of my reviews of a knife ( which was not at all bad ) probably because te cherry pick reviews to make their goods appear always brilliant .
neutral	a review system_works if you allow all of them to be pulished and not just those that give high rates .
neutral	i had a very good experience and i am glad i had the treatment .
neutral	even some of the follow_up appointments were positive but then when i was due for another follow_up appointment and rushed to get there only to find the shops had shut_down ?.
neutral	i was not informed of their intention to close both shops at lakeside but what really annoyed me was the fact i received an_email reminding_me of my appointment the following_day but the shops were already shut_down .
neutral	still to this day i have not received an_alternative appointment .
neutral	great seats and great service with recent tickets to see paloma at liverpool empire .
neutral	' enjoy the show ' text / email was a nice_touch ~ but extortionate booking_fee / admin / postage and vat took price to over_£_000 for 0 £_00 . 00 seats !
neutral	eye - watering !
neutral	never again !
neutral	!
neutral	i had a voucher for a photo_book so put it to good use making a gift for a family_member who_lives abroad .
neutral	if i had realised what a long and drawn_out process downloading and using the software would be , i might not have bothered !
neutral	compared to other online services i have used , this was slow and annoying .
neutral	when i had finally finished making the book , it kept showing me a warning that i had left some pages blank which i knew i hadn_'_t .
neutral	by this point i was so bored with making the book i took my chances and placed the order .
neutral	on the plus_side the book arrived promptly , is of good quality and there are no blank_pages !
neutral	so all in all , the software could be a lot better but the end product is as good as any others i '_ve had made previously and it will make a nice gift .
neutral	i ordered and had my flowers delivered in november_0000 , never received a confirmation_email but the flowers got to the person on time .
neutral	however in may_0000 i receive the confirmation_email ..... at_least it was the email late and not the flowers .....
neutral	the tube shakers was good but after a few uses the end broke .
neutral	other instruments good .
neutral	picked a certain option as it contained rosed and fresias .... unfortunately it wasn_'_t clear that these would be substituted along with every other bit of greenery except eucalyptus
neutral	not the best quality but i guess that '_s why it '_s cheap , returns and refunds extremely slow , took 0_weeks to get a refund although is stated in their website , on a positive the boots i ordered were very good value good value .
neutral	the cushion as a gift was a lovely idea but unfortunately it was not obvious from the computer_screen that the meaningful verse i had added should have been on the white shirt as it is not possible to read with the black_background .
neutral	this was not obvious on the computer_screen .
neutral	i would have liked for you to have discovered this fact before completing the cushion .
neutral	however i accept that it was my mistake .
neutral	hi , i received my blind and the quality was no where near as good as my previous blind .
neutral	i have contacted you by phone and spoke to phil who was very helpful .
neutral	i sent photos of the faults and was assured i would have a new one delivered .
neutral	i am still_waiting but i know it takes a little time to make made to measure .
neutral	an update of the problem would be grateful as i am without a bathroom blind .
neutral	good and interesting deals but i would love to see more long_haul holidays and cruises .
neutral	despite having a miner small piece not perfect where charger connection being perfect ,!
neutral	i feel with your quote of £_00 . 00 was right for my mobile in almost perfect_condition .
neutral	a well looked after one .
neutral	barely scratched or marked .
neutral	just normal wear and tear !
neutral	i feel orange weren_'_t ever going to give quote originally set as who_wants too ?
neutral	so giving me £_00 . 00 instead which i couldn_'_t be bothered to haggle about ...
neutral	despite i was told by someone they would pay that price too
neutral	but all in all a good service
neutral	the tall chest of drawers i ordered was made of solid pine and looked good .
neutral	sadly , the top was damaged .
neutral	it appeared that this happened before it was placed into its cardboard_box and should have been spotted before packing for delivery .
neutral	on further inspection , it also had a mark on the plinth .
neutral	it was badly made , as it was 0 cm taller on the right side compared with the left side .
neutral	not only did it look like the leaning tower of pisa next to another piece of furniture but also anything round would roll off the top .
neutral	i arranged for it to be collected and a refund to be made .
neutral	i had paid for express delivery and delivery before_midday , as i did not want to wait for delivery all day .
neutral	i was told that this service would not be available for collection , which could take place any time between 0 . 00 an 00 . 00 .
neutral	the refund was received promptly 0_days_later .
neutral	however , i was disappointed about the complete_lack of quality control in this company .
neutral	it was a great suit my son_loves it the only_thing was it had a hole in the seam of the glove i would say cheaply_made should be better quality for price
neutral	the online system is brilliant and certainly saves you rushing_around when youi can reserve and collect !
neutral	the only problems seems to be lack of stock and chosen stores so sometimes when ordering a few items you cannot get them all from same store which is not good as they only hold reserved items until end of the next_day and if you have to wait for another item to come_back into stock it means going back to collect !
neutral	few bugs and we don_'_t get the confirmation_email all the time ( even in the spam )
neutral	my mum said i should complain as there were two flower_heads broken off and the flowers were in poor condition .
neutral	she said the packaging eas dreadfully battered .
neutral	i ordered a prescription_drug which did arrive reasonably promptly .
neutral	but nowadays , when i order online , i expect to receive order updates .
neutral	i should be able to track when the prescription i posted in was received by pharmacy0u and when my order was due to be despatched and actually despatched .
neutral	as it is , all orders show with a status of " new ".
neutral	none of those things are difficult to implement .
neutral	called customer_services to enquire_about the status of my order and was given conflicting updates which really didn_'_t help .
neutral	the website was nice and easy to use .
neutral	i particularly_liked being_able to say i wanted my delivery to be left in the porch as i am not often at home .
neutral	i was anoyed on the day of delivery when the company delivering texted to say someone must be at home to receive the order .
neutral	i had to rearrange the day , and also get the delivery address changed to my work .
neutral	this should be made clear on the website .
neutral	the woman i spoke to at trophy_store was unaware of the delivery company '_s policy .
neutral	i had agreed for this to be delivered on a particular day ( friday 0rd_january ) but all that turned_up was the mattress and so i was very disappointed .
neutral	the courier company did contact me after leaving them a message to say the bed_frame didn_'_t arrive with them until late_afternoon so it wasn_'_t their fault .
neutral	i rearranged to have it delivered the following_monday as they don_'_t deliver over the weekend .
neutral	it was a pain but looking into it , unfortunately it '_s not unusual for deliveries by this company , it seems that a lot of people have problems with deliveries not arriving on huge specified date .
neutral	i am pleased with the bed , it looks nice and went together easily enough .
neutral	i thought the ordering was so simple from go - electrical and i had the opportunity to
neutral	put down any special delivery requirements , which i did , asking for a wednesday delivery , not a specific date , just a wednesday , then i could ensure we would be in .
neutral	so what happened when we got the delivery details , dpd wanted to deliver on a tuesday .
neutral	when i tried to alter the arrangements on dpd site , it wouldn_'_t let_me so the items were delivered on the tuesday after i '_d had to re - arrange my day - thought i '_d got that one covered .
neutral	so although go - electrical were good it would put me off ordering from them again .
neutral	arrived at heraklion airport at midnight .
neutral	we wanted a peugot type but were ' upgraded ' to a ford_focus .
neutral	it was very dark and not brightly lit and we had to sign to agree that there were no marks on the car before he would let us take it .
neutral	as we were driving off we noticed the passenger_side wing_mirror was not working_properly .
neutral	we told the guy but he wasn_'_t bothered .
neutral	on a long trip it started to rain but when we put the wipers on we realised the tank for the washers was empty which was annoying and points to sloppy care .
neutral	when we returned the car a different guy managed to find a tiny_scratch that we hadn_'_t see in the dark .
neutral	he tried to get awkward saying we had signed that there were no marks when we picked it up .
neutral	don_'_t know if we will hear_anything further on that point but didn_'_t like their attitude and wouldn_'_t use olympic again .
neutral	we were a little shocked arriving at ardent_parking ... it is very basic and this is not portrayed on looking for parking .
neutral	however ardent_parking do not hide this on their website and the service was excellent , though you may want to take your wellies in the winter !!
neutral	we have to admit we feared for our car a little as we left as security doesn_'_t seem as tight as others we have paid for in the past ... and have paid a similar price .
neutral	having said that the car was ready and waiting for us on our return .
neutral	it really is no_frills .... value for money .
neutral	disappointed the first time i have used this firm , an offer for bridgestone_tyres at discounted_price of £_00 from £_000 and the order cannot be fulfilled - that makes me not impressed at all
neutral	re - delivery date cannot be stated but at_least 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	i have just looked at your web_site and you are still offering the bridgestone_tyres 000 / 00 r00 00h - which strikes me as not bone fide
neutral	you are offering me another tyre , the continental which is comparable in quality and offered at £_000 from £_000 , so i am told , but then told that the bridgestones are very popular - so divided advice
neutral	we got the call to go and collect my ring .
neutral	when we got there ( it '_s a long drive ) we found that my ring had been made the complete wrong_size .
neutral	when they '_d taken the order originally they hadn_'_t written down the size and instead of phoning to ask they just guessed !
neutral	it was far too small !
neutral	i '_m a o and it was j .
neutral	they initially offered to resize it there and then which we were not happy about .
neutral	we '_d have lost quality making it so much bigger .
neutral	then they offered to give me the one from the shop floor , which everyone would have tried on .
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy so they did agree to make a new one and post it to me when it was ready , free of charge .
neutral	we had intended to order my fiance '_s ring that day too but after this experience we actually went to another jewellers who managed to make his ring on time and perfectly .
neutral	we were given his with a valuation certificate , photo etc .
neutral	mine from marlows just came in a box without even a cope of the receipt .
neutral	and mine was mich more_expensive .
neutral	really disappointed and has made what should have been a lovely experience that little_bit less special .
neutral	the ring is beautiful but i think everytime i look at it i '_ll feel that twang of disappointment .
neutral	a good choice of frames and quick service , but i wouldn_'_t use again because seeing a picture on the internet isn_'_t the same as seeing the real_thing .
neutral	i ordered the trial_frames so knew what i was getting with those but i also wanted a blue_tint to my lenses .
neutral	i applied the tint to the picture on the internet and it looked exactly_what i wanted so that '_s what i ordered .
neutral	when the glasses came the tint was so light you could hardly see it - nothing like the picture had looked online .
neutral	i rang up to say how disappointed i was but they just said i could have the colour of the tint changed but couldn_'_t have the colour made stronger .
neutral	the problem is i only chose the frames i did because i thought they would look cool with the blue_tint , so now i '_m left with a pair of glasses i don_'_t really like .
neutral	:-(
neutral	had some issues over xmas regarding a return , but eventually i did receive an_email that said it had been challenged by the level of orders and customer_services inquiries .
neutral	i had sent mails and left voicemails to no_avail , so the customer service note was welcome .
neutral	let '_s see how things proceed : placed one order since then and delivery was excellent and no_issues with returning one pair on the order which did not fit as expected .
neutral	we arrived @ dalaman_airport and found the coach straight_away a transfer that normally takes 0 . 00_hours took nearly 0 hours we ended_up getting of and walking to our hotel as we had to change buses and the driver didnot have a clue_where he was going
neutral	i paid . 0 % to transfer money recently .
neutral	on looking up other banks after transfer , i saw that i would pay nothing in fees with rate of exchange the same or slightly better .
neutral	so will certainly have a good look round next time i need to change money .
neutral	i see the above star system seems to be mainly estimated on " friction ."
neutral	there was no friction .
neutral	wrong_size , but great that you can just take them to a collect point to return .
neutral	no_complaints ( other than that the narrow size could have been clearer on the website ).
neutral	bought a oliver burton watch should of included some free earings that i did not receive but watch looks classey
neutral	for a wedding present my mother suggested a nice diamond_necklace .
neutral	i chose the diamond pendent that you have to thread the necklace through the bail , so the diamond was the only feature .
neutral	ordering was easy and it was delivered on time .
neutral	i decided to obtain the chain for a different jewelers .
neutral	once i obtain a chain i went to thread the necklace through the back of the bail , this did not fit .
neutral	i took the diamond and necklace to a jewelers for them to fix it together .
neutral	on doing so the jeweler informed me that the diamond would not sit on my neck properly as the weight of it would roll the diamond over .
neutral	i tried the necklace on and found that this was to be true .
neutral	my wedding was in three_days so i was faced with a dilemma , do i send the necklace back and have no gift from my mother to wear on one of the most_important days of my life , or do i adapt the diamond so it is on a barrel .
neutral	i decided to adapt it and pay another cost so that i could wear the diamond on my wedding day .
neutral	i was very disappointed and upset to say the least .
neutral	if my wedding was not within a few_days of receiving the diamond i would have sent it back and ordered a different style .
neutral	the earrings that my husband brought me were to match the necklace ( now that was altered ).
neutral	the earrings are very nice but i also found these a little large to pierce through my ears .
neutral	i chose the screw earrings as i didn_'_t want to lose them if the butterfly came off .
neutral	i would have liked to have given 0 starts .
neutral	the diamonds are beautiful but i feel that i was miss sold a product .
neutral	i can not default delivery or order process of my purchases .
neutral	i would recommend diamond_factory to friends , however , i would inform them that the screw earring do come up larger and that the necklace that i chose does not sit properly once on a chain .
neutral	it took over a week to arrive . the item was reduced but thought the p / p was over the top for such a small light item i have now spoken to the company and all is resolved now happy with service
neutral	once again , a large company that does not seem to understand that customers live down small lanes in rural_areas that do not conform to the usual rules of satnav .
neutral	having taken time and effort to choose our piece of furniture , we also took time to explain to the shop salesman - and write on our order form - that we lived in a rural_area suited to smaller type vehicles and it was best to ring ahead for directions .
neutral	none of this useful advice was passed on to the delivery team who arrived irritated and well over their tight delivery schedule time .
neutral	can '_t blame them for being fed_up but the delivery was rather abrupt as a result .
neutral	furniture ok , but the process of delivery needs review to ensure customer messages are taken_seriously .
neutral	i used iflorist for a friend and for mother '_s day ; the flowers for the friend lasted a long while and were very good .
neutral	the mother '_s day ones lasted 0_days .
neutral	great service from the website , just not sure about the appointment of the local_florist the other end on the second bunch .
neutral	i really like the blinds we have received although i am a little disappointed in the fittings as they don_'_t seem to work as smoothly as i would like , but the actually look of the blinds are great , exactly_what i was looking for .
neutral	your e_- mail told me it was coming monday .
neutral	about 0 . 00 i phoned delivery company who told me that it was definitely not coming monday but would be delivered tuesday in a particular time_slot , which it was .
neutral	i was not in a hurry for this item so give me the correct information and there will be no problem ,
neutral	therefore not wasting my time ..
neutral	was advised good were in stock and that i was ordering in time for delivery next_day .
neutral	goods did not arrive next_day and when i chased i was promised a call back whilst they checked , unfortunately this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	chased the next_day and was told they were going that day but no real reason_why they did not go when they should have , had to request an am delivery as the fitted was due in
neutral	its a shame as i have used before and not had a problem but i suppose every company needs an off day !
neutral	it was lucky that we hadn_'_t had rain , or a rubbish collection that day .
neutral	i think that the delivery service left a lot to be desired - no card was left to say that the parcel had been left , or where it was
neutral	these are the things i liked ..
neutral	i really like the cereals , especially pink apple & cinnamon porridge .
neutral	the soups are tasty such a butterbean , lentil and vegatable .
neutral	the snacks are fine but not enough choice for someone_who has a sweet_tooth like me .
neutral	pasta and fish dishes were nice .
neutral	chocolate milkshack
neutral	things i didnt like ..
neutral	the dinners were my biggest struggle .
neutral	i didnt manage many dinners and made other food instead which is a disappointment .
neutral	the meals were either bland or had too much sauce , making them runny .
neutral	suggestions ..
neutral	add a choice of desserts as oppossed to snacks
neutral	make the chicken / meat dishes with less sauce and more meat .
neutral	ordered 0 diarys from jessops and had to pick photos to put in them - got the item but not sure its what i thought it would be the photos are just paper and thought they would be stronger than that
neutral	ordered two bouquets , at the same time , to be delivered to the same address , on the same day .
neutral	one arrived , one didn_'_t .
neutral	the second one arrived the next_day but no - one was in .
neutral	my email complaint and request for an explanation has_been ignored .
neutral	the flowers arrived on the monday and i '_m told they were lovely .
neutral	i '_ll try serenata one more time , but any more glitches and bad manners and i '_ll not use them again .
neutral	i placed my order on 0th_june and received an acknowledgement .
neutral	i also uploaded the prescription , as requested .
neutral	also acknowledged .
neutral	i heard_nothing more until the 00th , when i received a " reminder " that the prescription had not been received .
neutral	i was surprised but attached it to an e_- mail on the same day .
neutral	i checked by phone that it had been received on the 00th and later that day an e_- mail confirmed that the order had been despatched .
neutral	unfortunately , the order did not arrive for another 0_days .
neutral	i will try the same company again , but will check that the prescription has arrived
neutral	when uploaded .
neutral	it was the first time that i used the company .
neutral	i would use them again but not for something that i urgently require .
neutral	i had to send 0 emails on 0 consecutive_days , 00 days after_placing my order .
neutral	on the 0rd day i got an apologetic email_informing_me that they were now dispatching my item ( what was going on for 00 days ?
neutral	i have no clue .
neutral	what would they have done if i hadn_'_t enquired_about my order ?
neutral	i have no clue ).
neutral	the thing is that they took the time to send me a promotional email instead of answering my request during my 0 - day -' chase .'
neutral	yes i got what i ordered but i do not recommend to use this company if you are in a hurry .
neutral	but should your possessions or buildings got damaged during the move , you are stuffed as anyvan can do bugger all to help !
neutral	have placed two orders since chritmas and both_times have had to telephone to make_sure order is being_processed .
neutral	each time told problems with website , please sort it out as soon as possible
neutral	i was absolutely amazed_how much packaging came with a pack of 00 flat back cardboard_boxes - far too excessive and such a pain for a small business customer to have to dispose of as general household recycling collection often will not take such a huge_amount of cardboard and shredded card packing .
neutral	on my first_attempt this time to order glucosamine 0000mg the e_mail gave_me a code to enter at checkout for 00_%_discount , but as i tried to enter the code it kept coming up ` code not valid `!!?
neutral	also the bottles i received were tablets not capsules !
neutral	the whisky was for father '_s day for my father - in - law .
neutral	it was sent in good time but delivered without signature to a different street .
neutral	luckily someone spotted it on a doorstep and realised who it was for and after checking with my in - laws went back to get it for them .
neutral	it could have easily gone_missing and caused all_sorts of problems .
neutral	this is not the whisky exchanges problem , but they need to know what is going on with their delivery company .
neutral	i '_ve emailed before placing my order so as to make_sure that i '_ll get a baby bottle for a girl so i '_ve asked so as not to send me a blue one .
neutral	i did not receive any reply until now !
neutral	i could not choose a colour myself while placing my order even if there were 0 colours available .
neutral	what is more , i '_ve paid with paypal so as to leave them a message again asking not to send a blue bottle .
neutral	i was hoping that it will be enough .
neutral	unfortunately , i still received a blue one ... waste of money as i will not be using it and it is not worth to send it back either
neutral	i ordered a new shower_tray , door and shower_head from betterbathrooms .
neutral	they all arrived on time .
neutral	unfortunately , as i am not a plumber , i bought a slim line shower_tray ( i think they look much_nicer_than the other ones ) i didn_'_t know that i would also need to buy a kit that included the legs .
neutral	when i have bought shower_trays in the past they have come with the legs .
neutral	when my plumber realised that the legs weren_'_t included , i contacted betterbathrooms and asked where they were .
neutral	i was told that i should have bought the extra kit and that i would need it in order to plumb in the tray as it was also going on a concrete floor .
neutral	as i didn_'_t want the plinth that came with the kit i asked if it was possible to just buy the legs .
neutral	i was told that someone would get back to me .
neutral	unfortunately no one did .
neutral	i contacted the company again ( on the same day , late_afternoon ) and was told that the legs were around £_00 , and that with delivery they would cost about £_00 .
neutral	the cost of the complete pack , with the plinth was around £_00 , so i decided to order the complete pack , only to be told then that they were out of stock and even if they were in stock i would not receive them the next_day as it was too late for a next_day delivery .
neutral	so i had a plumber who couldn_'_t do any work , and a tiler who was waiting to tile the shower room after the tray was installed and no kit .
neutral	the next_day i spoke to dave in the wigan office .
neutral	he was very helpful and suggested that i buy a kit that contained four legs and have my plumber put supports under the middle of the shower .
neutral	thank_goodness he suggested this as i was desperate to get the equipment needed to complete the installation .
neutral	i had also bought a shower_head that was too small , so i ordered another one .
neutral	this was on a next_day delivery but actually took two_days to get to me .
neutral	i did phone to complain_about this and spoke to someone in customer_services .
neutral	she was very helpful , found out when the delivery was occurring and said she would try to get the cost if the delivery refunded .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t heard_anything from betterbathrooms regarding this .
neutral	it should be automatically refunded if the items don_'_t arrive on time , there is nothing to think about .
neutral	overall i would say that betterbathrooms are good value for money .
neutral	their staff are helpful , but it would be a good idea if there was a pop up when ordering these slim line shower_trays asking if feet are needed as they are not included .
neutral	after all there is a pop up offering accessories etc .
neutral	also refunds on delivery charges should be automatic if they do not arrive on time .
neutral	l was initially impressed with the choice of items for sale and the speed of delivery .
neutral	however on my third visit l had a couple of questions .. first was non - availability of previously sold stock .
neutral	so sent 0 emails and so far have not had the courtesy of a reply ,
neutral	and secondly your ' live_chat ' does not work !
neutral	have tried both these formats over the course of 0_days and ... nothing !
neutral	so not certain what to do next .
neutral	it was my fault of course as i didn_'_t read the description of the contents but when the parcel arrived i was disappointed that no wine was included .
neutral	i think the price was expensive for just what was basically cheese and biscuits .
neutral	that will teach me to read more carefully especially as , as a warfarin taker , my husband can '_t eat cranberries and this was his fathers ' day present .
neutral	thanks to orange i can stay in contact with all my family .
neutral	no matter where they are .
neutral	thanks
neutral	on arrival the villa was not clean .
neutral	the pool was unusable for 0_days .
neutral	the owners kept appearing at different times - once at 00_pm - to rummage through the garage , with out warning .
neutral	the so called " mid week light clean " was a quick walk round and a change of towels from old worn ones to even worse ones .
neutral	battery went flat in smoke detector one evening and kept going off until we removed it from the roof .
neutral	outside lights were hanging off with wires exposed .
neutral	lots of niggly points but overall it was just a bit_disappointing for a villaplus villa .
neutral	not up to the usual standard .
neutral	booking was quick and easy , and we had a good email with useful info and directions .
neutral	however we had a nasty surprise when we got to the hotel of an extra £_00 overnight parking charge .
neutral	had an_email argument with the " customer service " guy_who pointed_out that this charge was listed in the " more info " link , but you had to go right to the bottom of the q & a small_print to find out about this charge , which really wasn_'_t obvious - it definitely could have been better communicated , so watch out !
neutral	i sent a iphone 0 00gb off and was offered £_000 .
neutral	i sent it the same way the phone was sent to me with extra bubble_wrap yet miraculously it arrived with a led fault ?
neutral	news to me apparently it couldve been there the whole time and i would never have noticed it ???
neutral	i think not , and if i didn_'_t notice it why did it matter so much for re selling it at their end ??
neutral	personally after_reading_reviews ( which granted i should '_ve done first ) i think i would advise people otherwise about this company as it just seemed to easy to come up with these random problems .
neutral	as for customer service yes they were speedy at dealing_with my problems and the call_centre was easily_accessible but i '_m still feeling a little deflated by the whole conversation .
neutral	i joined_quidco because of the good reviews , but i have had nothing but log in problems .
neutral	in fact untill recently i hadnot touched the site for 0_months because of this .
neutral	i once again tried to log in and have met nothing but problems .
neutral	i do not think that the site is user firnedly at all
neutral	i purchased a cross - hatch jacket , which looked very nice .
neutral	however , due to the time of year it was impractical as i was hoping it would be thicker - no fault of stand - out .
neutral	ordering was very easy , and customer service was great , i ordered the wrong_colour and quickly emailed to see if i could change this - it wasn_'_t a problem .
neutral	quick delivery and i got what i had ordered .
neutral	on realising that the item wasn_'_t suitable , i had to send back .
neutral	my only issue is the cost of returns .
neutral	it cost me nearly_£ 0 , to send it first_class recorded .
neutral	i didnt have to send it this way but for peace of mind , i think most people would send it recorded .
neutral	anyway , you do not get re -_imbursed for the return cost , so basically , i have lost £ 0 and got nothing to show for it .
neutral	which is a shame .
neutral	if i knew what i was wanting , and had physically seen the item , then i would have no - hesitation using the company again .
neutral	the sooner the govt reduces the vat threshold so that companies like play can '_t take_advantage of it the better .
neutral	then we can buy from companies that don_'_t split an order for 0 cd / dvds into 0 parcels so i end up having to pick them up from the post_office 0 bloody times !
neutral	sure pricing is ok but just so they save the vat they split orders into amounts that are less_than £_00 or something .
neutral	i see that tesco , asda and all the rest of them ship from the channel_islands too nowadays so they can all save on tax - while the rest of uk companies have no choice but to pay it - money goes to money as usual
neutral	i have bought from them a few_times and if you are willing to wait a few_days longer_than say amazon then you can probably get it cheaper here than most .
neutral	the issue is with electrical equipment that requires a uk plug - both time i have not had one and it '_s come with a eu plug instead - so i have had to go out and buy a plug convertor - kinds of defeats the savings .
neutral	we have used virgin for our florida flights quite a few_times - using air miles collected through amex and then xferring them to virgin .
neutral	problem we '_ve had this past 0 or 0 flights is the attitude of the virgin crew on the plane has_been really poor .
neutral	sure they smile when it suits them but there has_been an air of everything is too much_trouble recently - rolling eyes , sighs , just general body language that indicates they would just rather sit_down and read their mags in between the times they throw meals at you .
neutral	we tend to travel with their premium service ( not upper but better_than economy ) and you tend to pay £_000 /£ 000 more per_person per flight - so a family of 0 it racks up .
neutral	for that money i expect a courteous service at all times .
neutral	we try and avoid them from now on .
neutral	we have had better cabin_crew service from bmi and even ba to be honest .
neutral	shame really , used to like virgin at first .
neutral	saying that - going to dubai with them this year in upper class so we will see - again - not by choice - just the only ones that flew there on the dates we had where we could use our airmiles to reduce the cost .
neutral	quick , easy and prompt payment .
neutral	are better deals out there but they make it so easy i keep using them !
neutral	however , recently_sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .
neutral	so , that makes me a little uneasy to be helping a company make money out of africa or wherever .
neutral	i mean , how can they make money on a 0nd_hand iphone when paying me £_000 ?
neutral	doesn_'_t sound right at all hence lowered review rating .
neutral	0_stars for service , 0_stars for morals .
neutral	nice item and communication was good about processing order .
neutral	unfortunately the light was not right for my project but as it was delivered while was on holiday and their returns is strictly 0_days and they will not accept it as a return .
neutral	this is disappointing as the box was not even opened and even after i emailed to query this they would not budge .
neutral	my advice is , nice items and good delivery service but make_sure you return any unsuitable items straight_away or you will end up lumbered with an expensive light you can '_t use or return .
neutral	on the whole i have no_hassle , but i was meant to get £_00 cashback for trying out netflix , but it never came .
neutral	put in a report regarding it and still never got it .
neutral	so misleading and dishonest .
neutral	on the plus_side i just transferred my money over to amazon and earned £_00 as a gift voucher :)
neutral	i bought quite a few items from tooled_- up . com and delivery costs and price of the goods themselves were really good .
neutral	all items were delivered very quickly less one of them .
neutral	this item ( ps00u compressor ) i purchased for £_000 which was a really good deal but it must have been on back order .
neutral	at no time was i ever updated on its status over the 00 days i was waiting .
neutral	in the end i cancelled the order and got another compressor from a different company which was delivered within 00_hours .
neutral	emails are never replied to either , so if they don_'_t reply to them why have it as an option to contact the company in the first place .
neutral	would i use this company again ?
neutral	yes i would , but it would have to be a very good deal on the item i wanted .
neutral	the delivery company they use ( dpd ) are excellent , they give an_hourly_slot for the delivery itself which is sent to you by text_message and email ..
neutral	the website said the blankets were in stock , followed_by an emailto say that there would be a two week delay .
neutral	this was disappointing , compounded_by the debiting of our credit_card account immediately .
neutral	have always been a 0 in tennis_shoes but the babolat one '_s ordered were too small .
neutral	got an exchange pair in bigger_size very quickly , but they were not the colour i ordered - i kept them as didn_'_t want to fork_out further postage payments !
neutral	my husband is 00 collar - always has_been but these shirts were too tight round the neck and under the arms .
neutral	also material very scratchy !!
neutral	didn_'_t think they were good quality at all .
neutral	specifically_asked not to replace my order if item not available but it was still replaced with something_else .
neutral	i am now having a terrible time trying to return package because they will not confirm an address to return the item to .
neutral	also said a courier would collect today but no one turned_up .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	if your order is not something you require quickly then this is a great site .
neutral	i was hoping to get my order in a few_days at the most , however it took 0_days to arrive .
neutral	after the first few_days of waiting chemist forest contacted me to say they needed more info before releasing the item .
neutral	the info was nothing essential .
neutral	other than tha product as i expected .
neutral	i was happy to receive some prepared gluten_free food but i was not enthralled with the taste .
neutral	i didn_'_t enjoy the thai_curry sauce but i will try a couple of other sauces in the future .
neutral	ordered oven to table dishes .
neutral	i measured the internal size of the dishes i had already .
neutral	the dishes arrived and they had handles on them .
neutral	the measurements given by pro_cook included the handles so they were smaller then i thought .
neutral	the dishes were lovely , just a bit of confusion_over the size .
neutral	also postage was £ 0 . 00 i think , they only had next_day delivery , not a cheaper postage .
neutral	i rang them up and i was told i could return them at my cost but it would have cost too much to post back using registered_post .
neutral	good customer service but too expensive for delivery and returns .
neutral	i '_ve been using this company since last_year september .
neutral	i '_ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
neutral	however , recently there was a mistake in my completed image and i dismissed it and stated the reason .
neutral	i waited a few_days and then emailed the uk support_team to find out how many more days it would take to rectify the issue .
neutral	i did not get a response .
neutral	i have happened to just log_into my account at rtb ( to find an_alternative way to communicate with them ) and found out it has_been completed ... why didn_'_t i get a notification that it had finally been complete ?
neutral	why didn_'_t i get response to the email sent ?
neutral	it '_s a shame because i had nothing but praises for this company , but i feel now that my custom has_become somewhat a bother to these people , even_though i am paying for my pictures to be edited .
neutral	yes , sometimes i send pictures one at a time days apart , sorry if this is irritating to you rtb , but i design and create my different variations weeks - months apart , i am unable to send images in bulk .
neutral	i '_ll look for a similar company to do my images from now on , i don_'_t want to be a bother .
neutral	i am kind of happy with the product but very disappointed with the colours .
neutral	i was expecting rather vivid_colours not pastel looking something .
neutral	i will not order again i am afraid .......
neutral	good service , the parcel arrived within the estimated timescales and was even left in the post_office for easy pick_up as missed the delivery .
neutral	however ecco offers no exchanges .
neutral	i had to return and make a new order for another size , i . e .
neutral	pay and wait for refund .
neutral	ecco also changes £ 0 for return postage ...
neutral	i was given a delivery slot of between_0am - 0pm !
neutral	absolutely ridiculous , but on the plus_side the pram is lovely .
neutral	the ordering process was easy but trying to get my boot delivered was not so easy !
neutral	the courier company left a card to say that they had tried to deliver , however if you don_'_t e_mail them before 0pm that same day then you can '_t have your delivery the following_day !
neutral	they wouldn_'_t allow me to collect it and making arrangements for them to leave it with a neighbour was very difficult and they can '_t confirm what time they will deliver , so trying to make_sure you are it home again isn_'_t easy !
neutral	my order was finally delivered 0_days after it should of been and i was the last delivery of that day !
neutral	it '_s a great way to get_rid of dvd '_s and cd '_s that were sitting on my self but prices were a bit low .
neutral	prompt pick_up but it took quite a long time to receive the money .
neutral	placed intial order for 0 items , delivery 0 - 0 working_days
neutral	placed further order 0_days_later , for 0 more items , again delivery 0 - 0_days
neutral	not heard_anything by 0th workind day on first order , so sent e_- mail , on 0th working day sent further e_- mail , to be told , both orders had been shipped together and would arrive the following_day , by courier , and postage for the first order was refunded , by way of an_apology ( still don_'_t know why first order was delayed ).
neutral	0_days after the courier was supposed to have delivered , a neighbour gave_me a box that he had taken in 0_days earlier but due to shift patterns hadnt been able to catch us in .
neutral	we were unaware that the parcel had been delivered to the neighbour as the courier left no card to indicate this .
neutral	having said all that , we are very satisfied with the goods , we would used nets 0 go again , but would suggest that there is more contact with the customer , when problems_arise , i would have gladly waited for the order , had i known there was some sort of problem , its was the not knowing that created problems .
neutral	the courier service should be notified of the problem , but we do not hold nets 0 go at fault for this .
neutral	the result was magnificent on my face , the products i bought helped_me to maintain the good quality of mis skin and i am comfortable of using them .
neutral	overall , the bouquet ( beautiful smile de_luxe ) was pleasing , although a little_disappointing that there were not as many white_roses as expected , and not sure what extra benefit was derived from a " de_luxe " version .
neutral	the flowers were left on a doorstep and were not discovered until late_afternoon when i rang to check .
neutral	the recipients were in all day and checked their door_bell was working - although i said to leave on doorstep in the instructions , this was in case there was no reply , and only if no response was made - not ringing the doorbell was not the idea !
neutral	sorry that my first experience with serenata was not a better one .
neutral	make the extras clearer - difficult to find baggage_allowance etc
neutral	i have been a regular user of the super cigs for a few_years , i have found that the batteries seem to wear out very quickly and need throwing away , and as for the cartomizers thetop coating around the outside peels off very quickly again not being_able to be used properly it is all becoming very expensive to keep replacing them .
neutral	i found the website very difficult to use - my order was rejected many_times , which_resulted_in my reordering , then my original orders were miraculously reinstated so i nearly ended_up with four times the product i '_d wanted .
neutral	couldn_'_t seem to order two different products either without_losing the first .
neutral	despite this i persevered and the product was delivered speedily .
neutral	i hope my next experience is not quite so tortuous and prolonged .
neutral	one product was not inside the parcel
neutral	excellent service from company - quick replies , lots of texts to keep you informed of progress .
neutral	but flowers limp !
neutral	order your tyre and making an_appointment is easy to do .
neutral	it can all be done online at your convinence .
neutral	i bought a tabour bathroom unit .
neutral	the web advertises the unit , but when you go to options the tabour toilet is at a additional_cost .
neutral	this is very miss leading .
neutral	i challenged as it was miss selling .
neutral	this was agreed and i was able to buy what i wanted .
neutral	i notice three_weeks_later that the web_site has not changed .
neutral	the service was great , all the phone_calls were answered quickly and the cso '_s were extremely friendly and polite .
neutral	the brighton team were excellent great service and lovely people .
neutral	the actual treatment involved about and hour of delay before i finally got to the treatment room so i was pretty nervous .
neutral	the actual procedure was ok , not painful although quite unpleasant , but initially i could see pretty well .
neutral	it did get very sore after about 00_mins but a friend had advised me to go to sleep for a few hours and when i woke_up i could see almost perfectly .
neutral	it was very exciting .
neutral	i opted for monovision ie a reading eye and a driving eye and personally i would not recommend this perhaps for me the sacrifice on long vision for reading was too great .
neutral	disappointingly 0_months after treatment i have suffered some regression and will have to have the procedure repeated as i now require glasses again for driving .
neutral	beware of the rental_desk staff we paid way too much for fully inclusive .
neutral	felt a little let_down as i had requested to be informed when in stock , was told 0 - 0_weeks ( quick reply ) asked to still be informed anyway .
neutral	on checking site a week_later found item in stock again but no one had let_me know , so understandable disappointed .
neutral	order dealt_with quickly , well_packaged & arrived as_described .
neutral	would use the site again
neutral	on the website it says 0_days dispatch but this means to the delivery company who then might take another week to deliver to you .
neutral	i phoned and complained and splash direct got us an earlier delivery using their pallet company .
neutral	our bathroom work was put on hold for 0_days waiting for it .
neutral	on the bright side , the shower_tray looks great and we are really pleased with ensuite end_result .
neutral	booking made easily , but i was surprised when the payment was taken .
neutral	not clear that extra_charges were added , sms confirmation , cancellation_cover plus booking_fee
neutral	flowers were delivered on time however the quality of flowers was poor considering price paid .
neutral	presentation was acceptable
neutral	after signing_up was offered security at an additional_cost at a later date , which i did not manage to navigate , so im left_feeling worried now that its not as secure as i '_d assumed .
neutral	i almost didn_'_t receive the product as the corner of the envelope was split with the rods hanging out and had burst through the courier plastic envelope , but lucky all the rods were received .
neutral	i am not sure but i thought that viagogo is supposed to give delivery service my correct adress .
neutral	maybe i am wrong but now i can ´_t get my ticket because of incorrect adress .
neutral	obviously ups customer service isn ´_t best also so i am trying all day to find out what wrong is with my adress .
neutral	everything seemed to be working fast till this moment .
neutral	hope you can help me .
neutral	my transaction_id_:_0000000 .
neutral	thanks
neutral	the service was excellent and i was pleased but the flower i ordered ( elegans ) an orchid that i chose was not the plant delivered !
neutral	however , my brother was very pleased with the orchid he received so all in all quite a good service .
neutral	i bought . the wonder_woman child '_s outfit ..... on arrival i thought what a great item but on closer_inspection i ended_up repairing seems that were not sewn ......... the outfit was for a 0 - 00 child but my daughter is 00 and it was massive so i would say go very small with the options ....... i think the item is overpriced for what it is ..........
neutral	part ordered does not fit machine even_though website specified model_number .
neutral	if the website wasn_'_t covered in customer testimonies saying how quick delivery was , i might have noticed the small_print about possible delivery time - but over three_weeks from intial order is ridiculous for one t - shirt .
neutral	would not use again .
neutral	quick delivery which was excellent .
neutral	however , unfortunately one of the containers of billy no mates was broken and some of the contents had spilled out into the box and from the box .
neutral	better packaging might be a good idea to prevent this from happening .
neutral	this help made up for the wrong estimation of delivery which was very annoying
neutral	i received notification that the flowers had been delivered to my sister who had just been in hospital , i received an_email to say that the flowers had been left in a secure_place in the front of the house , this was totally incorrect as my brother - in - law had taken delivery of the flowers , which , had been delivered by a large furniture type van .
neutral	although my sister rang to thank me for the flowers i get the impression that the flowers were a lot smaller_than i expected as i up - graged to deluxe also the vase i purchased was described to me as being very small .
neutral	the delivery was very quick and also free , but i would not purchase from serenataflowers again .
neutral	nice little trophy
neutral	easy to fit .
neutral	mechanism poor 0 out of 0 blinds won_'_t stay in open position .
neutral	your site is complecated to use .
neutral	can not book a new tyre a mot or service at the same time .
neutral	hence with booking individual services you can not get times together .
neutral	i will think_twice before using again .
neutral	approx 00 day delivery a bit too long i felt , the product is fine although perhaps not as sturdy as the blind it replaced .
neutral	flowers were well_presented and i am happy with the flowers , but as nice as they if i am honest i am unlikely to use the eflorist again as my usual online florists are a lot_cheaper and include free delivery
neutral	xxxxxxxxxxxx
neutral	i just love it thanks
neutral	i purchased slimming tablets because or the excellent price and the fast execution of my order .
neutral	however the delivery was less_than reasonable .
neutral	it took hermes 0_days !!
neutral	looking at the delivery log they said they tried to deliver on the 0th day , the non - delivery excuse was " no access " and repeated once again on the 0th .
neutral	this was rubbish ; i live on a small but busy public access road .
neutral	i rang direct chemist office and spoke to their representative who contacted hermes .
neutral	she returned my call 0 hours_later to say that the delivery person admitted that the no access excuse was untrue and he had had a problem with his vehicle but would deliver on the 0th day .
neutral	a pity i was not informed as i knew the package had to be signed for and had waited in for 0_days !
neutral	!
neutral	hermes employ drivers with their own vehicles and these drivers do not want to deliver out of the city to country areas as they don_'_t make so much money and it is time_consuming .
neutral	dhl , ups , parcelforce & the post_office all make 00hour delivery and i wish we had a choice of couriers .
neutral	if i order from direct chemist again i will have to take the slow delivery time into account .
neutral	delivered with box tipped up on side even_though it clearly had arrows on box and fragile written on it .. was also delivered 0 hours earlier_than tracking said so was just lucky i was home !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of neoprene shorts ( 0 . 0 mm and 0 . 0 mm ) in size youth .
neutral	both way too_big for a 00 year_old boy and one much bigger_than the other !
neutral	hopefully physioroom will change the size on their site or at_least give measurements .
neutral	highly_recommended they are quick and efficent . i would defineatly use this company again and again
neutral	manglende information da det_var meget svært at høre .
neutral	vi_havde brug for hjælp med bagagen men_det kunne_ikke lade sig gøre der_var mange elevatoer .
neutral	disappointed sadly , rather a shame .
neutral	the squeaky pig was destroyed in half hour by my jack_russel !
neutral	the big hamburger has lasted 0_days til now ans is still whole .
neutral	all went ok until the payment , the ipad failed to print a receipt for me in store and so i was assured this would be sent out to me in the post , one month later i still_haven_'_t got my receipt !
neutral	salesman was polite and friendly but the handover to the person_who took the order didn_'_t go smoothly hence above problem .
neutral	this site has lots of adverts and things jumping around , you can '_t spend too long on it but it does have some gems & good tips
neutral	thw delivery took a little_longer_than other_places .. the clothes looked different than in picture .
neutral	but were still nice . unfortunately non fitted me as all dresses verry short !
neutral	!
neutral	they were all xheap as chips though !
neutral	the website is good , plenty of outfits for my chosen theme , reasonably_priced , could do with more choice on accessories .
neutral	i picked_up my dress yesterday but was dissappointed at the quality .
neutral	i bought the rubix cube dress , held the dress up to show my sister , and we could see right through the back if it !
neutral	i cannot wear that , needs to be thicker material .
neutral	i know it '_s not worn often but , u are showing it off for that night , everyone looking at u , it needs to be better quality .
neutral	ordered wooden silver_cross pram for my grand_daughter 0st xmas and waiting to see if it will be available at end of sept
neutral	i had a phonecall yesterday at 000pm ( courteous at_least ) but due to a computer_glitch my bouquet ( for my mums easter gift ) wouldn_'_t be delivered today ( day before easter_sunday ).
neutral	really sorry but i could either have a refund or upgraded bouquet but not till tuesday .
neutral	i live 000_miles_away from my mum and it was too late to get another florist to deliver for me .
neutral	lets see what arrives on tuesday .
neutral	normally a fab service but very very disappointed on this occasion .
neutral	great choice of costumes ...
neutral	great speedy service ...
neutral	disappointed by the wrong product arriving ... school advent ....!!
neutral	!.
neutral	my son was unable to go into school fancied dressed as planned ....( yearly fun run advent ..)
neutral	my initial experience was very disappointing as my parcel took a long time to come and on arrival the product box was empty .
neutral	after_speaking to customer service i had to send the empty box back and order a replacement .
neutral	all in all it took nearly 0_weeks from initial order to receiving my product .
neutral	i am happy with my product and would consider_using beautybay again .
neutral	i like all the items i have received , they are as they should be with out complaint .
neutral	however i feel the delivery is very slow , i did really expect my goods within 0_days but then maybe that ijust me having a high expectation .
neutral	i would allow 00 days for delivery .
neutral	the only_reason i expect quick delivery is becuase i can get all the items ordered from my fav ebay in a quicker time .
neutral	otherwise a good place to buy , just not for me .
neutral	ordered dahlias and asters . you had no asters and you decided to supply a substitute , more dahlias . finished up with more dahlias than we required
neutral	food wine and electrical bargains brilliant and cheap cheap cheap but they buck pass if a fault develops , so a bit_iffy for computers , cameras etc , might need to regard as a write off if they go_wrong .
neutral	great prices and choice but delivery had always been over a week since we placed the order
neutral	brook_taverner '_s pricing policy is like dfs sofas ; you cannot be sure what the clothing '_s true value is .
neutral	unless it is because i was a new customer who didn_'_t know the system , but i find their offers are misleading .
neutral	i thought i would receive a 00_%_discount on my order but it is only redeemable on a further purchase .
neutral	another example : i ordered 0 polo_shirts at £_00 each and when they arrived there was a leaflet_enclosed advertising 0 polo_shirts for £_00 ( about half price ).
neutral	i assume this works for brook_taverner but it does not work for me .
neutral	however i was pleased with the quality of the clothes i ordered and their service was first_class .
neutral	on balance i would probably consider_buying from them again .
neutral	we ordered 0 different trophies as employee awards with 0 different engravings but when they were received the engravings had been put on the wrong trophies .
neutral	however , trophystore sent new trophies with the correct engravings within a couple of days so we were still able to present the awards on time .
neutral	the trophies ' glass needed a bit of a clean .
neutral	overall the trophies were nice products .
neutral	we chose on site airport_parking after a bad_experience of parking off site on a previous occasion ( not edinburgh ).
neutral	the booking was done easily on line , the fee was competitive and reasonable .
neutral	the only_thing i would fault was the lack of signs telling us where we had to go to wait for the bus transporting us to the actual airport .
neutral	i went one way and my husband went the other each of us thinking we were going in the right_direction it was very dark and neither of us knew where we were supposed to be heading !!!!
neutral	we ended_up chasing a bus that appeared which thankfully stopped .
neutral	we got on and said " good morning " and added " we were glad to have seen him "... no response :( he just stared right through us .
neutral	overall now that we know what to do we will_definately use the service again , but it could be greatly_improved by clear airport signs especially for first time edinburgh_airport users :)
neutral	great price ( especially when compared with our vet '_s price ), excellent delivery ( next_day ), very polite and helpful customer service but too many tins were severely dented .
neutral	need to check that none have " blown ".
neutral	with a product for dogs with severe digestive_problems this is worrying .
neutral	the selling part was very easy .
neutral	i decided rather_than a cheque i would take an argos_voucher which_meant 00p more for my phone .
neutral	i probably wasted that having the activate the argos_card by ringing the 0000 number .
neutral	would not recommend taking the argos_voucher unless they give you an 0000 number to activate .
neutral	i was impressed with the communication from the company and the speed of delivery .
neutral	however the packaging used had flattened the paper cupcake_cases somewhat .
neutral	i was also disappointed to see that the best before date for the sugar paste was end of april_0000
neutral	quick delivery but not able to orrder a pedestal with a basin !
neutral	!
neutral	i have recently used serenata_flowers on 0 occasions , both_times with a discount_code
neutral	bought through amazon .
neutral	whilst both lots of flowers have been stunning , each time i have had great difficulty using the amazon discount_code .
neutral	the first time someone did phone me and things were corrected but the second time , despite 0 e_- mail requests no - one contacted me ; i was totally_ignored .
neutral	not good personal care .
neutral	paid to extra to get the largest_bouquet and was disappointed .
neutral	i was there when the flowers arrived and whilst a nice bunch they didn_'_t particularly look like they had been super - sized .
neutral	the site was great , but the difference in quotes was phenominal ....
neutral	ranging_from £_000 - £_000 for the same amount of stuff and the same amount of men .
neutral	all the removal_companies were professional and websites were brilliant so that took my mind off of the troubles of moving .
neutral	thanks you it kept my mind at rest .
neutral	to charge £ 0 for slow delivery and £ 0 insurance is the highest of any company i have ordered with .
neutral	i ordered some flowers as a congratulations gift for a colleague_who had just had a baby_girl .
neutral	i chose flowers from the baby_girl section of the website , a lovely bunch of pink and lilac flowers .
neutral	although the order was delivered exactly on time , my colleague received a bouquet of red_roses - not really what i wanted .
neutral	was sold product based on trust regarding opinion on potential salt consumption for a four person family .
neutral	salt consumption is at_least double what was advised , hence running costs are double .
neutral	very effective product nonetheless .
neutral	installation was slightly careless in terms of pipes being fixed to the wall in a messy way and no touch - ups done where the paint was unnecessarily stripped from the wall .
neutral	the booking was made relatively easy , even for me but i was disappointed to find that baggage was not included in the advertised price and it '_s not until you are along the line with the booking that this is obvious .
neutral	i then tried to discover how much the cost of adding baggage would be and am still in the dark .
neutral	however , i did continue with the booking in the hope that the price doesn_'_t double when i finally learn how much the baggage will add .
neutral	i was surprised that you had to add veg , fruit and dairy to the diet as i thought everything would be included .
neutral	as the diet wasn_'_t cheap .
neutral	meal suggestions were shown on the front of the packets but i was given no idea of what to add or how much .
neutral	in fact i found i was eating more than i would normally eat .
neutral	when i said i had not lost any weight i was told i may be eating too much or not enough , what kind of an answer is that ?
neutral	not much help !!
neutral	most of the meals were very tasty but some were really awful eg . chickpea stew .
neutral	and some meals were very high calorie .. this diet may work for some people but it hasn_'_t worked for me . it was a very expensive mistake to make to order this diet .
neutral	we have only tried three steaks so far and they were very good quality - cooked and ate very well .
neutral	a bit disappointed with the quantity though .
neutral	i would say that there was £_00 - ish worth of meat in the hamper rather_than £_000 so you get what you pay for rather_than the hamper being half price ( we are beef farmers and i am used to good quality beef and know what you have to pay for it !).
neutral	the staff were very helpful and the beef_joint that was missing from the original hamper arrived when promised .
neutral	i have used mp for over 0 years_now and have always found the service from_start to finish fantastic , however this year it has_been horrendous , my last order i paid_extra for next_day courier ( ordered on a thursday at 00am well within the same day dispatch period ) i received a mail that afternoon to say it had been dispatched , friday came with no sign off it , contacted mp they couldn_'_t give me a tracking_reference for it , eventually got the tracking_reference on the monday and it ended_up that they didnt give it to the courier until friday_afternoon .
neutral	the items arrived on monday_afternoon and after a few mails i got them to refund the extra payment for next_day delivery as they had not delivered .
neutral	its such a shame as the products are fantastic but your only as good as the service you provide and this area is definately lacking recently .
neutral	i wouldnt be so quick to blame the courier , mp are marking items as dispatched without actually dispatching them by the looks of things , please sort it out !
neutral	great ear_muffs , can '_t fault the service , but they stuck a big orange sticker on the outside of the ugg box , which i wanted to keep ..... thus ruining the box when i removed it !
neutral	very disappointed !
neutral	the sticker could have been put on the base of the box !
neutral	tesco has always been my favourite store especially as iuts 0 mins from my house .
neutral	but since the store renervation its nothing but a mess .
neutral	nothing is in any type of order and its a nightmare to find anything .
neutral	also i go to shop at 0 . 00am and the store is always in a mess .
neutral	boxes everywhere , crate waiting to be unloaded and internet_shopping carts on their way round which i know they have to do but the other staff doing the same thing stop for a mothers meeting in an isle and you cant get passed .
neutral	and dont get me started on the ghuy who washes the floor with that machine .
neutral	he will not move for the customer , he wold rather run you over or wait all day until you move for him .
neutral	he is so ignorant i want to hit him .
neutral	i use a wheelchair and still he makes me shift out of the way for him .
neutral	the isles are so croweded with boxes i actually got stuck last_week and couldnt move it was such a mess .
neutral	come on leatherhead tidy up your store .
neutral	when the parcel arrived even the courier passed comment about the way the goods had been packed , the box seemed to have been made up of bits and pieces of cardboard and only had one fragile_tape around the centre of the parcel .
neutral	thankfully none of the contents were fragile nor were any of the bags of food broken as previously .
neutral	happened .
neutral	this is the second consecutive parcel i have had delivered from chemist_direct in this condition and am now convinced it is due to incompetent packaging in their packing department .
neutral	i did write and complain before about the lack of care in packaging and suggested they review it at their earliest convenience , obviously this has not been done .
neutral	i have written to them direct but have not received a reply , so much for customer service
neutral	service and delivery good for 0 identical orders , but ignored instructions to leave with neighbour , instead left at front of house .
neutral	flowers were in good condition but not as plentiful as photograph .
neutral	my phone was submitted without a mark on it as had screen_protector on front and been in a case since the purchase but they reduced price by 00_% due to scatches on front & back !!
neutral	no mark at all went sent - very unhappy !
neutral	please be careful when sending in your phones !
neutral	lenses ordered on sunday evenings normally arrive on tuesdays - that '_s what the website advised .
neutral	not here until weds this month , not thier usual service level .
neutral	my barbour waistcoat came very quickly , really liked it but it was a bit_tight , bad_news i was i £ 0 . 00 to retrun , post_office said that was the cheapest , wont_be ordering another one
neutral	after initial email_confirming a possible delivery day , it came 0_days_later .
neutral	i had to chase them for a date as they never called me despite the email_saying they would do .
neutral	however products arrived within allocated 0 hour time_slot , helpful delivery man and products just as ordered .... always a bonus !
neutral	a one of a kind website with really reasonable_prices .
neutral	a real wide_range of products with different choices of styles and colours .
neutral	i '_ll definitely be shopping here again for sure , however one of my nail_varnish products did come in the wrong shade ..
neutral	have ordered a few things & some been ok but two not .
neutral	i rang and asked about twist mop i ordered they looked into it told me i had not redeemed voucher or had e_mail saying not gone_through but i told them they had taken postage of £ 0 . 00 & not had e_mail to say not gone_through but they closed it anyway .
neutral	i ordered a toning belt paid postage no email to say gone_through so rang and was told had gone_through should be delivered next week .
neutral	so not all e_mails come through .
neutral	i think they should put on your account redeemed when been redeemed , then mistakes won_'_t be made
neutral	i purchased the plum pixie fairy costume which was unfortunately not as pictured .
neutral	flowers on headpiece and neckline were much fewer and ribbons on headpiece and wand much shorter .
neutral	overall disappointed .
neutral	had i purchased this in person from a shop it would have gone back straight_away .
neutral	such is the inconvenience of online shopping .
neutral	quick service but photos poorer_quality than on similar_sites .
neutral	good variety of page_layouts but the book was not as good quality as others .
neutral	i am a little disappointed with the visual side of things .
neutral	the adverts led me to believe that the visual pane would be wide and unfortunately the reading magnification is quite weak in comparison to my reading_glasses that i got 0_months before from the opticians .
neutral	i am pleased with the frame and the quality of the glasses .
neutral	the fitting_centre staff were obviously working really hard and were undermanned for the amount oif work that they had on .
neutral	this was made more difficult because they did not operate an_appointment system as stated and booked on the website .
neutral	with nowhere to park in the street , it potentially looked as if a wait of several hours was going to happen .
neutral	one other tyre_shopper customer arrived shortly_after me - he was less_than impressed too .
neutral	in the end they shuffled some cars and we went off and came back in two hours - the work was fine and i have no_complaints about their actual work .
neutral	after rectifying it .... it didn_'_t look too bad !...
neutral	but the rose_bush is beginning to die !!!....
neutral	which is ' nt what you would of expected !
neutral	! i am very dissapointed !.....
neutral	this was a thank - you present to someone_who has_been very kind !!....
neutral	considering the thought behind the gift .....
neutral	i don_'_t think that the gift has_been value for the money spent !!
neutral	!
neutral	since changing from virgin_bingo to virgin_games the site has_gone down_hill .
neutral	only having 0 bingo games is disappointing as is not being_able to choose exactly how meny tickets you would like to buy , for example if i had enough money to buy 0 tickets i could only buy 0 due to your fixed amounts plus i don_'_t understand_why you can '_t buy 00 tickets by clicking 0 tickets twice as there is no option to purchase 00 tickets .
neutral	you have lost most of the slot games from the previous site which offered a lot more variety than what you have now .
neutral	you have slot games which are unplayable one that comes to mind is manopoly dream life .
neutral	the mechanic adam was great but booking service got address and time wrong .
neutral	i purchased a morphsuit as a halloween_costume .
neutral	unfortunately , when it arrived it was packaged so snugly within the plastic_covering that when we opened the suit , some of the imprinted pattern was stuck to itself and some of the the colour peeled_off and ran into other colours , spoiling the overall look of the outfit .
neutral	we were on a tight time - scale for getting an outfit for the party and did not have time to replace this costume with iwoot .
neutral	we were rather disappointed .
neutral	from payment to delivery was very quick .
neutral	the material the glasses are made from arn '_t the best quality in my opinion and the lenses attract a lot of dirt and dust and i constantly have to clean them and even using the duster that came with the glasses still leaves them smeared .
neutral	i give 0_stars for quick delivery but only 0_stars for quality of the glasses so on average 0_stars .
neutral	i ordered the valentines chocolates advertised on site and the ordering process was very simple .
neutral	the site navigation was good and i found the site user_friendly .
neutral	after_placing my order , i received an order e_- mail and have had an update a few_days ago to say the order has_been dispatched .
neutral	so far , that '_s the end of the story .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for the chocolates but remain hopeful they will turn_up for valentines_day in good condition .
neutral	my biggest worry when delivery takes a long time is the condition the chocolates are in when they arive as i do intend these to be a gift , hopefully , all will be well .
neutral	bought an alphatrak machine , the best price i could find on the internet .
neutral	paid for express delivery which was meant to be between mon to weds but didn_'_t receive until thursday which was the estimated_date for free delivery wish i '_d not paid the difference
neutral	i recently ordered a pet_prescription .
neutral	i did receive it quite quickly but i was irritated by being sent texts and emails saying that , without a signature , the prescription could not be serviced .
neutral	i always send the prescription straightaway so didnt need being " mummied !"
neutral	perhaps if they were to wait four days and then send one email or text , that would be a great improvement .
neutral	othewise it is just poor marketing and plainly patronising .
neutral	unless this improves , i will order elsewhere next time .
neutral	purchased pet_remedy spray for nervous dogs - smells foul and the dogs won_'_t go near it - can '_t imagine how it is ever going to work .
neutral	service was very good - 0 day delivery .
neutral	delivery and information was very good . sister was thrilled with bouquet but the flowers only lasted three day then the roses turned brown and the other flowers started to wilt .
neutral	showing product as stock when it was nearly two_weeks before delivery was made .
neutral	poor response for a mid - quality product at premium pricing .
neutral	they need to be upfront about delivery times and actual stock_levels in house .
neutral	shopping with " chemist_direct is easy but what i think is a bit_pricey is the postage ,
neutral	i '_ve_used carphone_warehouse for several_years_now either for phones or accessories and overall they are ok .
neutral	my most_recent experience i would give 0_* for as it was brilliant !
neutral	i wanted a iphone 0 and put my name down on the website as interested and also in various stores in town including their cw store ( who as with everywhere_else , couldnt really reserve or help as no one knew what stock they were getting )
neutral	i was going to be unable to get to a q due to work_commitments and had resigned_myself to waiting until the phone was back in stock again , but , at 000 the day before launch , i get a call from their call_centre offering me a chance to upgrade to the iphone 0 and it would be delivered on launch !
neutral	i was sceptical but went along with it and low and behold it was delivered , as promised , to my home address before 00 am ( i think it was about 0 in fact ) - i can '_t really fault that - no q and no_hassle .
neutral	on the flip side , i have been into my local_store ( basingstoke ) and had mixed service over the time .
neutral	a few_months back i was lied to over a charge to administrate the conversion of my iphone_0g contract to a rolling 0 month_contract .
neutral	after lots of schpiel about why it will save me money , and having said ok , thanks , i was halfway_through having the paperwork drawn up before the chap had the decency to tell me that this would set me back £_00 admin_fee .
neutral	caught me a bit off - guard but i agreed and did ask if that was a standard fee imposed by 00that i would pay if i called them , to which he said " yes " so i continued .
neutral	however , after calling o0 , i later discovered that this is not the case as i could have called them for free and had them administrate it for free .
neutral	i was fuming , so returned to the shop and after i explained to a sales_assistant , my discovery , they apologised and gave_me my money back .
neutral	i also had a couple of faulty products at the time too and they were very good with the way they dealt_with me & the issues - no one likes going in with a problem , let_alone 0 from one shop , so hats_off to them on this occasion .
neutral	personally , after this , i am a little_wary still ( as lies shake your confidence - an " i dont_know " is far better ) but this was a one off for me and out of the amount of times i have used them , this is a small percentage of problems - usually they are very helpful and knowledgable .... in my branch anyways .
neutral	hope this helps !
neutral	the bouquet is nice but the roses are not looking fresh and the crysanthamums are purple not red which was not at all as_described .
neutral	part of the reason for ordering was that the red would go with the recipients decor .
neutral	upgraded to deluxe_bouquet as a birthday_present .
neutral	i saw the flowers 0_days after delivery .
neutral	deluxe was 00 roses with the same 0 freesia .
neutral	the freesia were very pale and not as vibrant as shown in photograph .
neutral	it actually needed more freesia to make it look lovely .
neutral	it just looked rather disappointing .
neutral	i '_ve shopped with active_beauty on and off for a number of years and i can '_t fault the customer service or value for money .
neutral	the products are always as advertised .
neutral	the trouble is , at_least 0 of my parcels have disappeared during_transit and it '_s subsequently taken well over a month from order to recieving the replacment .
neutral	if i '_m organised and not in a hurry , i '_ll take the risk but if i '_m shopping for holiday bits , gifts , or if i '_m running out of product , i go elsewhere .
neutral	the uncertainty of whether the goods will arrive doesn_'_t always justify the financial saving .
neutral	fast delivery watch was as required .
neutral	but watch wasn_'_t fully_functioning on first use e . g .
neutral	the light didn_'_t work .
neutral	a few_days_later it stopped_working and the battery had to be replaced .
neutral	sadly my product hasn_'_t arrived but in fairness this isn_'_t the normal service from pet_supermarket .
neutral	i '_m hoping that another will be dispatched or it will finally arrive !
neutral	the product i ordered was an alice in wonderland dressing_up outfit , for a 0 - 0 year_old .
neutral	my 0 year_old daughter couldn_'_t even get it on - it was ridiculously small .
neutral	looked into returning the item , only to find that i hadn_'_t been quick enough ( a very short 0 day returns window ) though there was no mention of this on the despatch_note .
neutral	i am now stuck with a product that i cannot use or return .
neutral	extremely disappointed .
neutral	arrived on right date and time but disappointingly the recipient said the vase aperture was too small for the rose and had to use one of her own , which i found surprising .
neutral	the flower was in very good condition and she was pleased but i was unhappy about the vase , if indeed it was as she described it .
neutral	we were pleased with the prompt service and the pump seemed ideal .
neutral	it '_s been working for 0or 0_days , aerating the pond and it has_been good .
neutral	however , today the flow was noticeably slower and on inspection it was blocked with debris .
neutral	we will clean it tomorrow and try again , perhaps lifting it up a little so its not pulling up debris from the bottom of the pond .
neutral	we particularly chose this pump as it said it was suitable for dirty water , but maybe not that dirty
neutral	everything went find , but it was difficult to find all of the " required " fields for replicating card designs and features .
neutral	had to keep going back to try to find the buttons and fields to fill out .
neutral	the internet site was a nightmare and i couldn_'_t order 0 thing the same , but to be sent to different addressed .
neutral	it took 0_days to get my order through and my son said i shouldn_'_t trust the site , but i persevered .
neutral	then i couldn_'_t submit my discount_voucher .
neutral	but the staff kindly deducted that from the total .
neutral	i phoned and left messages but no one got back to me either on the phone or through email .
neutral	all in all , i have been very pleased .
neutral	the carrier_bag shop was great for ordering and keeping you informed with details of when the package would be delivered however when the package arrived only half of my order was correct .
neutral	i had ordered 00x small white bags and 00x large white bags , the small bags were perfect but the large white bags had been sent with a white body and cream handles .
neutral	i know it doesn_'_t sound like a major problem but it wasn_'_t what i had ordered and when using them for gifts as an illustrator the appearance of the overall product really counts .
neutral	i sent an_email to say i had received something different to what i had ordered and they got back to me within a couple of hours , however they wanted a photo of the bags before they could help me but i was out and my phone is not reliable for sending emails so therefore i couldn_'_t send a picture until i had access to the internet .
neutral	the bags took three_days to arrive which made the delivery on a friday so it turned_out i wouldn_'_t receive any correct new bags until the following_monday or tuesday , this was not an option as i already had orders to deliver that weekend so i had to use the wrong bags they had sent me anyway .
neutral	i '_ve still not received an apologie for their mistake .
neutral	hi i would like to make four points , first i had four parcels , three came with one driver and the last one with another driver .
neutral	it actually made me laugh .
neutral	secondly the point i wasn_'_t happy about , the cello_bags were hanging out of the box as they weren_'_t tied down or covered up .
neutral	it '_s not very hygienic and i don_'_t even know if any has fallen out .
neutral	point three and four are good points .
neutral	they appear to be good quality and the delivery was very fast .
neutral	many_thanks ,
neutral	ruth
neutral	product perfect , but discount was tricky to redeem .
neutral	i bought the initial item as a gift , it was returned but recipient was unable to choose something_else .
neutral	i had to buy it .
neutral	when i came to checkout , it also wasnt clear to me how to redeem ( whether to put the code into promo_code or not ).
neutral	not great considering i work in ecommerce for a fashion retailer .
neutral	wait_till i get the order
neutral	item arrived as expected and within stated delivery timeframe .
neutral	however , had i realised when i initially ordered the product how long the delivery process would take i would have bought the product elsewhere .
neutral	0 - 00 working_days is far longer_than most retailers work to .
neutral	bought two lovely vegas bar_stools in april_0000 , one broke after just over one '_s year '_s use order number :_00000000 , after checking the website i realised that these were only guaranteed for 0 year only , this was very disappointing .
neutral	i placed another order :_00000000 to replace both the stools at an additional £_00 discount each to compensate for the broken stool .
neutral	arrived very promptly but was the wrong stools !
neutral	i had to send these back and at the moment still deciding on what to do .
neutral	in the meantime i have one broken stool which i thought would have lasted more than a year , especially after paying £_000 . 00 each for them .
neutral	a little dismayed !
neutral	the order time was quite long well over 0_weeks , blind quality looks average .
neutral	with poor fitting kit screws , definatelty not suitable for a full patio window drop .
neutral	colour is not a good representation online pictures .
neutral	price and service experience ie website was good but delivery was slow taking over a week when we lost the best chance of doing the work in one weekend
neutral	the offer is misleading .
neutral	the shop took over 0_weeks to send my phone back and i received less_than i was originally offered .
neutral	the items ordered were good value for money .
neutral	however the delivery cost was outragous , which unfortunately i had no choice as i needed next_day delivery .
neutral	i was disappointed to receive a geographical puzzle with an_error in it ( 0 counties in wales mixed up ).
neutral	if you are going to do geographical puzzles , get the geography right and don_'_t just send out faulty goods with a correction note !
neutral	i have used gd for many_years and have often recommended them to others .
neutral	for their great value and fabulous service
neutral	i purchased a new set of frames in june and wiuthin a few_weeks the arm screw came out and then as a consequence , so did the lense .
neutral	i returned them , together with an older pair which had also lost an arm , ( asking if they could_possibly put any old arm on my old pair .)
neutral	the response was no , they did not do old parts but could let_me have a reframe at a reduced price of £_00 ( which i declined .)
neutral	fair_enough .
neutral	however , my big_disappointment was how the new breakage was dealt_with - very automated , with not an_apology anywhere , actually the whole_thing was highly inconvenient - i was without specs for a week , had to pack them up and send them back etc etc , only a few_weeks after i had bought them ,
neutral	then a final letter in my returned glasses anonymously thanking_me for ordering my new_specs and hoping i would be pleased with them and assuring_me of their 000_% commitment to customer service .
neutral	if you are going to cut_corners and costs gd - do it in the back room not at the customer face - i will not be returning
neutral	my order took over a week to arrive after i had to contact them , have had lots of orders before and order usually_arrives within 0 / 0_days .
neutral	hopefully just a one off .
neutral	i will_continue to order but may leave a longer time for expected del .
neutral	ordering was easy , delivery great .
neutral	this coffee looks the part , the capsules are very similar and even some of the names and language used to describe them is similar .
neutral	however , that is where it ends .
neutral	i found the brew to be much weaker , lacking in taste , flavour and depth .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	really gutted .
neutral	it looked so promising .
neutral	if you prefer a mild coffee this could suit you very well .
neutral	it is cheaper ; but for me , i don_'_t want to compromise on flavour so it '_s back to the original branded capsules .
neutral	sorry
neutral	i ordered my guitar_amp on a monday and was delighted that i '_d get free next_day delivery .
neutral	i stayed in the following_day and no amp arrived !
neutral	i then phoned guitarguitar and received an_apology for not being notified that the amp wouldn_'_t be delivered and was assured t would arrive on the wednesday .
neutral	this was no good as i would be at work and there would be no one to sign for it !
neutral	it was then agreed that the delivery address could be changed to my work place and it would arrive at my work on the thursday .
neutral	this seemed to be a reasonably satisfactory_outcome .
neutral	i arrived at work on the thursday , checked my emails only to discover confirmation of my amps delivery to my home address - i was not impressed !!
neutral	i emailed guitarguitar straightaway but heard_nothing back from them i have now received my amp but there seems to be a distinct lack of communication !
neutral	the collect_+ couldn_'_t read the screen on my phone and struggled to do the process , it ended_up taking 00_minutes .
neutral	next time i will simply collect from the post_office or just pay the extra for the postage to home .
neutral	very - decent , but dress is pretty short , deceptively so compared to the photos , however i needed a new work dress asap and didn_'_t have time to shop so this was quickest .
neutral	will be adding material to hem of the dress to make it longer .
neutral	usually stay in long_term parking , but preferred the more efficient and shorter distance to the airport and return ,
neutral	have always been happy with freshcig very prompt delivery and products usually spot_on .
neutral	however last order not happy with the two wick less vaporisers did not work tried both types of batteries but hardly_any vapour came out and it was not nice will not order them again as can not use them very dissapointed as up to now have been very happy with freshcig
neutral	even_though i had booked and paid for the rental in_advance , when i arrived at gatwick there was no car for me .
neutral	you can_imagine i wasn_'_t too pleased !
neutral	the girl on duty had to ring round to 0 different_locations to find one for me .
neutral	admittedly it was an upgrade on what i ordered and i was in fact very pleased with the car when it arrived , but i had to wait over half an_hour for a car to materialise .
neutral	great value for money and free next_day delivery - superb !
neutral	however , payment is via_paypal , would have preferred other methods of payment .
neutral	i have used cybercandy a few_times , but find that the website isn_'_t very modern or well - organised .
neutral	while i almost always get everything i want , there are times when they are out of stock on an item and they have not charged for it , a good thing .
neutral	i think the most difficult part about working with them is that it is hard to feel really secure putting details on the site because i haven_'_t seen any security information and it doesn_'_t feel secure , though they have always given good service .
neutral	this always makes me look at other shops before buying .
neutral	it would be great to see them invest a bit of money in developing the site so that it secures more customer confidence .
neutral	bought 0 magnetic polishes but one didn_'_t work .
neutral	returned it and received replacement after about 00 days , but that one didn_'_t work either .
neutral	can only_assume it was a faulty batch in " the west_end " colour .
neutral	i found using the site very easy , good value for money and definitely cheaper_than_anywhere_else .
neutral	however , the courier used clearly did not read ( or maybe did not receive ) the explicit instruction left regarding delivery and leaving at a safe_place at my home , and i had to contact customer_services ( delivery ) on a number on which i only had push_button responses to use .
neutral	not acceptable on any level .
neutral	pet_supermarket did resolve it for me , but , will i use it again ?
neutral	probably not .
neutral	like most people i work for a living and the courier will only deliver mon - fri free of charge , if you want delivery on a saturday it is apparently £ 0 extra which would negate the saving i make on my pets food .
neutral	disappointing that this is not taken into account .
neutral	didnt get full order .
neutral	but took money straight out my bank for th full order , then got amessage aday or two later saying my order was on its way then got another message_saying one ov th items i especially wanted was cancelled .. if they were out ov stock surely they shouldnt have let_me order them , then i had to email yous afew_days_later to ask for a refund of the item that was not sent .
neutral	over all abit disapointed .
neutral	the tablets for reducing appetite were no good at all in fact i found my appetite increase .
neutral	i believed what i read on your site but they were a complete_waste of money .
neutral	i get too many emails a week - i '_ve unsubscribed because of this .
neutral	i was emailed about 0 times to ask my opinion in the service and now i am giving you a poor review .
neutral	my flight was fine but booking on your sight was difficult and kept sending me back to my original search but with increased prices .
neutral	please do not email to thank me for this review !
neutral	flowers arrived with no description explaining who they were from and why they had been sent .
neutral	a moment spoilt / lost .
neutral	i received my vibration_plate very quickly but 00 screws and washers were missing .
neutral	i was told it may take a week for me to receive them !!
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy not being_able to use the equipment i had paid for .
neutral	i am always over charged in their store and the staff are cluless .
neutral	try asking one of their " expert staff " about the bike you just bought and they just look at you like you asked them a complicated maths question .
neutral	they are usualy more interested in standing around chatting .
neutral	i know more about bikes and i '_m a girl , ended_up fixing it myself !
neutral	the same goes for car parts .
neutral	every time i shop at tesco they over charge me on the bogof_offers or sale items .
neutral	you have to watch every item go through the till and check your receipt .
neutral	if i had not done this every time it would add up to about £_00 just in the last few_months .
neutral	no wonder they are so rich !
neutral	i cant understand_why my order came by post the french postal_system is so slow .
neutral	this is the second seal i '_ve purchased .
neutral	neither one of them would fit onto a curved door like the marketing_material suggests .
neutral	trying washing up liquid , silicone grease , or soaking the seal in warm water made no difference .
neutral	they don_'_t fit on a curved door no matter_how hard you try !
neutral	waste of time and money .
neutral	placing the order is easy and delivery is good however both of no use if the seal won_'_t go on the door !
neutral	wouldn_'_t recommend the product to anyone .
neutral	have tried several_times_now to order online .
neutral	when i get to payments section it freezes .
neutral	i start again and the same thing happens .
neutral	a little while later i receive email from chemist_direct to say ive ordered something twice when in actual fact the order hasnt been completed online .
neutral	the products are excellent value for money , but size variability is a problem that tends to limit what i buy .
neutral	shoes and boots are terrific , albeit often a size smaller_than in the shops .
neutral	bags are rather cheap looking , but then , they are cheap !
neutral	also , if you don_'_t preview the items to do on the site for the following_day and you ' re not around to log in at the time they go live , then you ' re likely to be unlucky , at_least in your choice of colour and size .
neutral	there are very few plus sizes available , anyone over a size 00 - 00 is out of luck .
neutral	the few larger_sizes that are available are not similar in style to the smaller_sizes , but much more matronly .
neutral	the flowers were nice and well_presented .
neutral	however they were not delivered before_00noon although i had paid the extra delivery charge for this priveledge .
neutral	i contacted customer_services who did respond quite quickly and following a couple of emails did refund the additional delivery charge .
neutral	will possibly use again as it is not about what goes_wrong but how you deal with it and i was satisfied with the outcome .
neutral	i found workwear_express very efficient .
neutral	our order was dealt_with quickly and sent out within they time they promised .
neutral	i was pleased with the artwork and initially with the t shirts we had ordered .
neutral	on closer_inspection , however , the t shirts were too short and after a couple of washes on 00 degree wash they had shrunk even more and had gone out of shape .
neutral	i would certainly order from work wear express again but would not order the type of t shirt purchased this time .
neutral	it was esay to use its just a shame that tickets are allowed to be sold for ridiculous prices when the originals can be brought for a much much_lower price .
neutral	feels abit like fans are exploited .
neutral	bought from xile before and always been really satisfied , this time however placed an order on the saturday expecting it to b here on the tuesday as thats what usually happens but no delivery . phoned on the wednesday and was told it was coz it was coming from glasgow , then recieved an_email to say it was dispatched from the edinburgh depot and didnt arrive till the thursday thus too late for my sons_birthday , customer service did say they would refund my delivery but i dont_know if this has happened , i will use xile again but was just annoyed as it was my sons_birthday_gift , thans fiona
neutral	i '_ve made a purchase with this provider for the first time .
neutral	the product hasn_'_t been delivered due time as the robot email suggested .
neutral	when xmas_period time passed , i was mildy surprised , as i received another automatic email prompting me to provide feedback about their quality of service .
neutral	oh well , it turned_out the shipment has never been delivered , so another free purchase was made .
neutral	i got mildly suspicious about the speed of delivery of the second ( free order ), this time arriving the very next_day of the purchase , despite the customer_care team told me they didn_'_t have one of the product on the stock , and therefor i would have to wait 0 additional days .
neutral	perhaps they '_ve forgotten my first shipment ?
neutral	whatever way , inconsistency in providing information to a customer can make a wonder !
neutral	update 0th_january_0000 : just received what i believe should be a retention campaign to keep customers .
neutral	! 0 %_off your next order until a month from today .
neutral	i am not going to change my shopping behaviour since 00 years , so thanks but the offer has no value to keep me interested shopping further with you .
neutral	there are means in e_- commerce these days to tailor timely offer to adjust to the customer , not the other way around ...
neutral	i bought the patagonia lithia skirt as a last_minute buy for my holiday not sure if it would arrive on time , but it arrived super_fast !
neutral	the skirt is lovely & i had planned on buying it in another colour .
neutral	unfortunately it has faded after it '_s first wash & looks well worn straight_away .
neutral	it wasn_'_t cheap so i won_'_t be treating_myself to another one .
neutral	can '_t complain_about the order / delivery service though .
neutral	love the product but did find the product cheaper in my local_store after ordering which was disappointing as gear0music have always been very competitive usually
neutral	my friend told my husband about photoworld and i thought i shoud give a try . i was very excited , remember i have know wedding_album .
neutral	so my husband and i embarked on the journey of photoworld to complete our_wedding_album . the end_result not what i wanted .
neutral	i had to purchase it as my friends are in holiday in europe and they will bring it all along . they are returnng on the 00th_january_0000 to namibia .
neutral	i am especially impress wth the good service in terms of emails and deliveries that were done on time .
neutral	my friend unfortunately told me there was a slight_dent in our book , i will only see it this week .
neutral	i wish i had more time to make album look more attractive .
neutral	i saw the other customers albums and i am really impressed , i saw other customers albums only after i have purchased mine and it was most impressive . i am dissappointed what my end_result is and what i could have done
neutral	regards michelle
neutral	ordered rosehip_capsules one day - arrived the following_day .
neutral	unable to comment on them as have only been taking them for a week and at present cannot see any difference in my condition { osteoarthritis } but keeping fingers_crossed for a successful improvement .
neutral	products looked as good as they did on the website , unfortunately a few of the balloons had to be discarded as they had holes in them .
neutral	i have been on the diet for two_weeks and have had to throw_away two of the dinners .
neutral	the rest of the meals were good if a bit boring , the snacks are very good .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i can justify £_000 for another 00 week set of meals .
neutral	i hope i don_'_t have any trouble cancelling the next order .
neutral	i have actually lost quiet a bit of weight and would continue if more of the meals tasted better
neutral	i haven_'_t received my lenses yet !
neutral	so not very quick delivery service
neutral	when i tried to book a little while ago my provider wouldnt let_me book as the licence had not been renewed and reckoned it was an unsafe site .
neutral	cant rate company until after i have travelled
neutral	the job was done efficiently and professionally .
neutral	the gentleman_who came out was friendly and knowledgeable .
neutral	i was disappointed though with the service when placing my order .
neutral	i would like to have had clarity as to why the tyre specified on my invoice was different to what i had asked for .
neutral	when i queried this it was because the requested tyre was not available but it took a lot of negotiating to sort_out the problem .
neutral	a pity because you offer a fabulous service and the work itself was done without fault .
neutral	i still have not recieved my perchase its been over a week
neutral	i purchased a fancy_dress costume for my daughter through ebay from megafrancydress .
neutral	i chose the free collection option rather_than pay for delivery but with hindsight this was my mistake .
neutral	however , the collection_point turned_out to be argos and my problem_arose when i tried to cancel my order within a day or so of placing the order ... first of all i was told it was too late to cancel the order and that i would have to use the returns process .
neutral	so i had to make a 00 mile_round_trip to the nearest argos to collect the item .
neutral	i explained to the argos shop assistant that i didn_'_t want the item and wanted to return it but was told that ebay items had to be returned via the supplier and that they were just acting as a collection_point only .
neutral	this made sense to me as i had paid mfd and not argos for the item .
neutral	so i then contacted megafancydress for their returns address and they told me the item had to be returned to argos !
neutral	i contacted mfd again and expressed my frustration at this and pointed_out that neither mfd or argos had informed me at any stage that the item had to be returned via argos and that another round_trip journey would cost more than the item i was returning .
neutral	i have had no further contact from megafancydress and am left_feeling that the whole_experience is severely lacking in customer service .
neutral	on top of this the costume i received came in a very tatty plastic casing which was torn and sellotaped back together ( perhaps a previous return item ?!)
neutral	i haven_'_t taken the item out of the packaging to see if the costume itself is in order as i was still hoping to return the item but with no further contact from mfd i am not prepared to make another journey to argos only for them to tell me again to go back to the supplier .
neutral	so not very impressed !
neutral	tried your capsules .
neutral	they re a bit_clunky , but i am tempted_by the savings .
neutral	trouble is nespresso is my morning indulgence and i almost don_'_t want to run the risk of not having great coffee to start the day .
neutral	daft but life is made up of small things !
neutral	to order again or not ?
neutral	i ordered once , didnt love it and went back to nespresso .
neutral	not sure .
neutral	requested the flowers be delivered on a saturday for a birthday surprise for the them to be delivered on the following_monday .
neutral	when opened some of the freesias had withered .
neutral	not the usual service from clares .
neutral	as an academic music tutor , i have found a good quantity of work through this website , particularly a - level students .
neutral	however the website is difficult to use and needs updating .
neutral	very easy to order from , however the stock_levels are not kept up to date enough and if your item goes out of stock , you may have to wait over 0_weeks to get your order .
neutral	once received , items are well_packaged .
neutral	the web_site was very easy to use .
neutral	a good & varied choice of nets .
neutral	i used the alteration service & they fit & hang perfectly .
neutral	however the delivery was very dissapointing .
neutral	i paid for the next_day delivery the courier did not come to my address or leave a card as stated , i had to ring them & sort_out the delivery .
neutral	this lack of service lets the company down .
neutral	bought couple of items great delivery bit emailed customer service 0_days ago still_waiting for reply .
neutral	a friend recommended westin_gourmet to me and due to that i received a pack of free sausages .
neutral	i was under the impression that i would get 00 free sausages but only received 0 .
neutral	it also stated on the receipt 00 x 00g but there were only 0 x 00g in the box which was a bit_disappointing .
neutral	whereas the chicken_breasts were really great and good value for money , the lamb_shanks i had ordered seemed far too expensive and i would not order them again .
neutral	i placed my order on a monday and was very disappointed that the goods i ordered were not despatched until the saturday , a delay of 0_days before they were even packaged .
neutral	i don_'_t really find this an acceptable way to run a business , although the goods were fine i will probably shop elsewhere in future .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	flowers were only ok . rose were nearly dead and one carnarion went straight in the green bin .
neutral	l : illys were lovely .
neutral	i found these tablets very hard to swallow .
neutral	even when breaking them up , i found them dry and hard to get down , even choking on them a few_times , now i feel like i don_'_t want to take anymore :-(
neutral	i tried_ringing to add another dog to my policy and was told i couldn_'_t i had to make a new separate policy .
neutral	i think something needs to be done about this as other insurance companies offer is .
neutral	while making the booking on line , i saw that ' all on board meals included in the price ' yet on my booking confirmation meals were ' not required '
neutral	am i the only customer to be confused by this ?
neutral	the only way to contact direct_ferries is by a phone_call , and after a lengthy_wait at premium_rate , a customer service person assured me that we would be having meals on board without extra_charge .
neutral	i await the outcome with some uncertainty !
neutral	so far i '_m not impressed .
neutral	recieved item quite quickly but sizing was not correct .
neutral	extra large 00 / 00 i dont_think so , and the halo was wonky !
neutral	also didnt quite look like the online pic !
neutral	!
neutral	when the flowers arrived they were buddy and fresh but because they had not been packed properly the stems of some flowers were bent and 0 flowers were broken off the lily stems .
neutral	the customer_services is rubbish because when i notified them they sent me a ' standard response ' email which indicates they had not read my email properly and it also indicates they are used to complaints .
neutral	a real_shame .
neutral	excellent quick , reliable service but have been told that while the flowers are very pretty , the bunch is very small .
neutral	not rereally a bouquet .
neutral	slightly_disappointed .
neutral	i ordered a sun_lounger set in march as a present - online it stated the items were in stock and would be delivered in 0_days .
neutral	when i rang the company they said the items weren_'_t in stock but my delivery would only take a couple of weeks .
neutral	then i got an apologetic e_- mail saying the loungers wouldn_'_t be with me until early may as they were on their way from china .
neutral	mid may came and went and after several calls i finally spoke to mark cartwright .
neutral	he assured me my purchase would be with me shortly .
neutral	then dx rattan_direct '_s courier " lost " my sun_loungers .
neutral	i received a call from rattan '_s head of logistics and he arranged for another courier and i received my sun_loungers on 0th_june .
neutral	great product high_quality , but i '_m still wondering_if it was worth the waitt and the hassle .
neutral	having said that mark cartwright and his colleague were very professional and did their level best to help .
neutral	00_minutes from terminal 0 , friendly service , was cheaper to have hotel for the night and 0_days parking , then just getting 0_days parking !
neutral	no lifts in the hotel , so carrying_heavy_suitcases up stairs to go back down stairs to our room was a bit unusual !
neutral	food was ok in the hotels bar
neutral	prices are competitive , product range looks good , communication is competent , but delivery fails an otherwise good service .
neutral	incidentally the delivery agent told cheap_smells that they had endeavoured to deliver on two occasions - on neither of these occasions did they leave a card advising me !
neutral	when i chased delivery with cheapsmells the item was delivered very promptly .
neutral	i am often frustrated that items which i have bought before are unavailable online and yet , if i were to go to the supermarket they would be on the shelves .
neutral	there are almost always substitutes for items i have ordered and they are sometimes totally different from my original choice .
neutral	having said that , the drivers are always very friendly and helpful so full_marks to them .
neutral	ok , first of all , they were the cheapest for the 0 hotels i needed , 0 in london for 0 nights and 0 in greece for 0 so there is that .
neutral	and their new website is ok .
neutral	the not so good now , they didn_'_t send the email_confirmation straight_away , the login process and access your data for the itinerary is poor quality ( gives no info !)
neutral	- i have booked in full a transfer which is just resold from a0b transfers and they haven_'_t sent me the voucher because the hotel is only partly paid till 0_weeks before_departure .
neutral	that is stupid , surely they have no right to use the transfer money as a deposit for anything_else .
neutral	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come_back to you and they are never apologetic .
neutral	i '_d say , use only when they are cheapest .
neutral	well i went to see a friend of mine a few_weeks back and they have got virgin rather_than sky .
neutral	i was so impressed with virgin that as soon as my agreement with sky has finished i '_m defiantly going with virgin_media .
neutral	great service but it was a shame i had ordered the wrong part !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the whole_process from tracking to payment is too slow and too fussy .
neutral	in my experience quidco are quicker and less ` fussy `
neutral	good prices , product and delivery but had problems getting an invoice had to call 0 times
neutral	we are in the caribbean and needed some beige whipping twine .
neutral	marinestore chandlery went to great lengths to get the twine for me and have it shipped to bonaire .
neutral	unfortuantely between calls and internet ordering i ended getting two lots of twine and was charged for both items plus postage .
neutral	there was no apology or suggestion of a refund .
neutral	i let it drop as i was just very grateful for the twine which i couldn_'_t find locally - but it did sour my view of their systems .
neutral	i ordered on 0 dec and i had to call several time to chase it up and it finally arrived 00 jan
neutral	i ordered invites for my sons_christening .
neutral	on the day i was due to get them i received a text_message from another customer informing_me she had received my invites along with her own thank_you cards .
neutral	to be fair , optimalprint were speedy in their response and re - sent my order to be which i received a day or two later and they were lovely .
neutral	however , it did not take away from the fact that a stranger had received my invites with a picture of my son on and my mobile number .
neutral	chemist_direct covers a wide_range of items all very reasonably_priced and the effiency when it comes to delivery is beyond compare .
neutral	not enough variety .
neutral	the soups don_'_t taste that good .
neutral	price is good compared to lighter_life .
neutral	product o . k , packaging very poor !
neutral	we had an issue with the first cleaner as she did not inform us when she could not attend .
neutral	there was also a bit of a language_barrier .
neutral	however , she left and the maid0clean quickly arranged a replacement cleaner .
neutral	she was very good and communicating was a lot_easier .
neutral	unfortunately a couple of the stems of the stocks were broken and as you can_imagine this brought disappointment to the birthday_girl .
neutral	very good but high charge for calling abroad
neutral	i requested delivery at 0 . 00 am for my uncles funeral , by 0 . 00 my cousin texted to say no flowers from australia !!
neutral	the explaination was that the funeral didnt start till 00 . 00 so they delivered at about 0 . 00 am .
neutral	heart in my mouth worrying .
neutral	very disappointed after_spending money on " expensive flip_flops " and they have cut into my feet !
neutral	i have let the cuts clear and tried again - same pain .
neutral	the delivery cost at £_00 . 00 was high and so i expected the product to be delivered on the date stated ( next_day delivery , date given was saturday ).
neutral	i waited in all day and it did not arrive .
neutral	the despatch email sent contained nothing that allowed me to track the parcel .
neutral	this is poor customer service , and something that could easily be remedied .
neutral	the item was not delivered until wednesday_afternoon .
neutral	having previously written positive_reviews other than some quality issues i am afraid i need to adjust my review .
neutral	i had been assured that my faulty item would be repaired and had a date booked for a repair man to visit .
neutral	unfortunately he articles without the means of repairing the item and i have had no contact from customer_services since .
neutral	i have emailed them twice to express my ongoing frustration and have had no response .
neutral	meanwhile i am stuck with a faulty , upturned cabinet with three legs , cluttering_up my hall not at all happy !
neutral	ordered 0 / 00 for 0st_class delivery , dispatched 00 / 00 , arrived 00 / 00 .
neutral	disappointed at delay in delivery but easy to contact , pleasant staff and the product is good .
neutral	still would do_business with them again .
neutral	chemist_direct is really good .
neutral	they send the goods as soon as they can but i don_'_t like the yodel delivery firm they use .
neutral	i did not hear the delivery person call , i was in at the time .
neutral	they left a card so i thought i would rearrange delivery .
neutral	well this is where the problem starts .
neutral	the card has only a web address or automated telephone_number , this is okay if you can understand what the delivery driver has written down as your parcel ref_number .
neutral	when you do decipher it , you go onto the web address to track it but the ref_number is not recognised , so you telephone the number and they don_'_t recognise it either !
neutral	they say hold the line and you will be put through to an adviser but cut you off instead , so you phone again and are kept hanging on so long you just give up .
neutral	well , i went back to my confirmation_email and used the link there and lo and behold i manage to track my order through hdnl .
neutral	that just tells_me that it was loaded on the van on 00rd may , so far it looks as though it '_s still in the van !!
neutral	thought they might re - deliver the next_day , so waited in but did not arrive so i arranged with my son to take me to the depot to pick it up , i do not drive and the depot is 0 bus journeys away from me and it would be too bulky for me to carry , but have no way of knowing if it will be there when i get there .
neutral	have successfully picked_up my parcel from the depot now , just a lot of hassle to get some tissues !
neutral	but i want to repeat , chemist_direct itself is a good place to shop , it was just the delivery of the item that was the problem , i will still shop_here ,
neutral	although the job got completed and the staff were individually helpful , the whole_process of repair took too long ( almost 0_weeks ) which i don_'_t find acceptable for a piece of critical office equipment .
neutral	i spoke with the sales director who explained that this was due to delays by suppliers , but still i feel something needs resolving in the process since the customer outcome is the same .
neutral	proactively keeping_me informed would have eased the frustration massively , rather_than me chasing updates every couple of days .
neutral	the item i ordered was not quite what i got , i asked for bone shaped tablets and i got ordinary round tablets .
neutral	we had a lot of building work down and the house had not been cleaned in a year .
neutral	i was nervous paying such a lot for the clean but it was completely worth it !
neutral	i am very hard to please and have trialed many regular cleaners because i always think i could have donw better but this time , really , they exceeded my expectations .
neutral	well_done .
neutral	just wish you did regular cleaning
neutral	i am adding to the above review as we had a couple of cleaners from ep_cleaners back to concentrate on a few specific cleaning tasks - nothing major , just one room , a hall , 0 or 0 light stains on new carpets and cleaning the inside of two windows where tape had made sticky marks .
neutral	we had booked 00_hours at a cost of £_000 so were pretty confident that would be more than adequate .
neutral	the cleaners arrived 00_minutes late without apology and then spent an additional 00_minutes getting their stuff out of the their car .
neutral	they were reluctant to use a dilute cleaning_solution i asked them to use to clean the room despite having cleared its use with eamonn on the previous visit and so wasted 0 of the 00_hours by not following instructions and having to clean the room all over again .
neutral	there were scratches on the new wooden_floor after they had finished which i had not noticed before and they said they hadn_'_t brought the right cleaner with them to take the sticky marks off the window so couldn_'_t do them .
neutral	basically , there was little improvement if any when they left ( on time ).
neutral	i emailed to express my disappointment and the response was a little scathing although i was told eamonn would be in touch .
neutral	three_months later and still no contact ....!
neutral	disappointing - for the price you pay you should be able to expect excellent results .
neutral	my regular cleaner at less_than half the price would have done a better job .
neutral	sorry but i wouldn_'_t use again .
neutral	ordered over the internet quickly and order was dispatched quickly , but was not happy with courier you use , he rang my mobile as my husband had to leave after waiting in all morning to ask if their was anyone_else i could leave my parcel with , i asked him to leave it with my neighbour next door or one up , but when my husband returned , a card was left to say it had been returned to depot miles_away , luckily we do have a car and were able to drive their taken another morning up , my neighbour had been in as she seen him leave our path with out knocking , on collecting my parcel it took over half an_hour to retrieve it , would definitely recommend a different courier or prefer it to be send royal_mail as i know if not delivered it would be taken to a local_depot a few miles_away
neutral	was told the flowers were lovely but haven_'_t seen them .
neutral	the larger set of lights is brilliant but the one with less bulbs only lights half of them and does not always stay on
neutral	to date i dont_think the intended_recipient has received the bouquet .
neutral	on checking out with you whether they had been delivered , i was informed that although a note was left , nobody had contacted royal_mail .
neutral	it would appear that through no fault of any particular individual , the flowers will have spoiled at the mail office .
neutral	just let_me print my ticket
neutral	the product i ordered was poor quality and quite_expensive so was disappointed with that , but delivery and service was fine
neutral	i '_ve always had dyson hoovers for the last 00 years but wen my last one pack in .
neutral	i went into an electrical store to purchase a dyson but came out with something totally different brand , this was partial to do with price and functions against other models and the staff_members recommendation .
neutral	overpriced for their packages and all you get is repeats all the time !
neutral	!
neutral	to many emails and offers to take in
neutral	why is it that companies like this one that set themselves up to do_business over the phone can '_t be bothered to find someone_who sounds as if they ' re even half - pleased , rather_than totally bored , that you ' re actually spending money with them .
neutral	if the girl who answered my call worked for me , she wouldn_'_t work for long .
neutral	shame , the bags were good .
neutral	good website , good variation of products , but the payment process was not good
neutral	not enough comparison photographs .
neutral	although description gives actual size of stone or earing it is difficult to assess what it looks like on an ear or a neck .
neutral	actually they turn out to look quite small on an ear or an adult neck .
neutral	beautiful but actually very small .
neutral	postage and service were good but offer of packaging - gift box or wrapping offer - did not present itself until after order was done .
neutral	wrong item sent .
neutral	phoned customer_services and replacement sent within a few_days together with reply paid bag to send back wrong goods .
neutral	i had wanted the thing quickly so it was a bit_annoying but at_least they put it right with minimal_fuss .
neutral	had to chase_up my order twice , although i had ordered early to take_advantage of your super discount .
neutral	i did my order on line so had copies of all my correspondence .
neutral	having said this i have used your service for a few_years and have always been pleased with my final cards .
neutral	i expected so much from this company but sadly , their customer service sadly let them down .
neutral	i order a product on a saturday , and wanted delivery on the first available date - which was the wednesday .
neutral	i paid an additional £ 0 . 00 charge for this delivery .
neutral	it didn_'_t arrive on the wednesday , so i sent an_email when i got home from work to see if my item had been despatched - as promised in the email_confirming my order .
neutral	it didn_'_t arrive on the thursday , neither did i get a response to my email .
neutral	the item eventually arrived on the friday .
neutral	i emailed again to advise i had received the item but was disappointed with the lack of communication from the company and to give them an opportunity to respond to my concerns before i put a rating on the website .... no overly_impressed , and no offer of a reimbursement of the additional_charge i paid for the quick delivery .
neutral	notenotenote ;
neutral	just checked my emails and have to say , have had a response .... timed at 0 . 00pm today ... they say my additional postage charge has_been refunded and blamed the courier company for taking it to the wrong depot ... satisfied , however would only increase to 0_star , due to the lack of information , and the time taken to respond to my emails !
neutral	bought this as one of my husbands_birthday_presents as it is retro and he_loves 00 '_s designs .
neutral	bought this as the option was for next_day delivery .
neutral	all through the day i received emails and the final one stated the parcel would be with me between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 that day .
neutral	when i looked again at 0 . 00 the tracking stated the parcel could not be delivered and i had to phone to re - book a delivery time - not what i paid for !!
neutral	!
neutral	took 00_minutes to get through but i was promised the parcel would be with me the next_day .
neutral	the parcel did arrive but this was a day later than i paid for .
neutral	i emailed the seller but received no reply .
neutral	the watch was great if not a little over packaged - at first look i thought they had sent the wrong item as the box was huge .
neutral	a nice item but i wouldnt shop with the sellers again as i had a bad_experience with the delivery and no email from the seller .
neutral	i put my order with you on the 0th_november and it is now the 00th_november and i still have not received them although payment was taken out of my account the day i ordered the cartridges on line
neutral	i found the staff to be a bit off with me .
neutral	when i contacted and said i had not got an_email from them , they replied that the information was in the email i '_d received .
neutral	i had to reply back and say that i had said i had not got the email and so did not get the information !
neutral	not partmaster '_s fault directly but packaging when i did finally get product was appalling .
neutral	the box was broken and crushed with the product half falling out .
neutral	and to make_matters worse it was filthy - covered in mud .
neutral	not happy really apart_from product itself being ok , even_though there was something missing which i fully expected to be in .
neutral	my friend appreciated the flowers - a good selection of flowers but some of the heads had broken .
neutral	not packed properly ?
neutral	found this website that offered more than just flowers to be delivered , ordered what i thought would be a special gift of flowers , mini_balloon and birthday_cake .
neutral	unfortunatley the cake was not delivered , which was a great disapointment as i received 0 really good emails , 0 to say they were on the way and the other to say they had been delivered .
neutral	=.
neutral	(....
neutral	had decided to book meet and greet at gatwick as we had a very early flight .
neutral	was a bit disappointed that we had to wait over 00_minutes for our car to be collected at 0am on the way out as we have a 0 year_old who was very tired .
neutral	however on the way home our car was ready and waiting which was nice as we landed at 0am .
neutral	i would use this service again as the price was reasonable and it was nicer_than getting on and off the bus with our_luggage .
neutral	on your website it said if u want next_day delivery ask .
neutral	i phoned & asked & was told it couldn_'_t be guaranteed .
neutral	i carreid on & then got an_email_confirmation saying delivery would be 0 - 0_days_later .
neutral	they actually arrived next_day , but i very nearly cancelled .
neutral	0 or 0 of the nite lites don_'_t work .
neutral	tesco has_gone down in my opinion .
neutral	their prices are no_longer cheaper_than other stores & you can '_t alwyas get what you want .
neutral	the clothes section is very disappointing .
neutral	i can never get the sizes i want & the choices & styles are not half as good as they used to be .
neutral	rarely bother to go now as i just know they won_'_t have what i want .
neutral	i would like to have seen prices and explanations for the extras , ie , priority_boarding , etc at the point of purchase in order for me to make a decision whether they were worth the money or not .
neutral	flowers are to a high_standard though i ask that when delivered that they knocked on door this did not happen as i was there at the time only found that my flowers were outside my door when i got email to say they been delivered .
neutral	i rather next time if the person would take a minute just to knock ...
neutral	i purchased this last night and i still have not received any emails saying it was successful ??
neutral	imei is correct ive made sure does it usually take this long its been almost 00_hrs ??
neutral	?
neutral	costume came pretty quickly , was not expecting much , but was expecting it not to be frayed at the waist .
neutral	size is huge so get the next size down .
neutral	never mind , i '_m creative and have made mine off the shoulder , added a laced corset over the top and a frilly under skirt .... it looks ok !
neutral	i found turnkey made the initial process for me much_easier and less scary .
neutral	however they completely upset my solicitor with their constant pestering that he refused to deal with them so i had to do twice the work and go as the go between .
neutral	front page said next_day delivery - didnt make it clear there was additional_charge .
neutral	send 000ml shaker instead of 000ml
neutral	i ordered a large white radiator .
neutral	i received an e_mail on the day it was due to be delivered to say the courier couldn_'_t deliver and it would come the following_day , as it was heavy and they needed a different vehicle .
neutral	it eventually arrived the day after that - but they sent a black one !
neutral	the invoice and the delivery note clearly_stated it was white .
neutral	very helpful people , arranged for courier to deliver the correct item and take away the wrong one , but by now my builder and plumber had wasted five days .
neutral	i ordered a set of car mat and a cover for my soft top when its down ' tonneau cover '.
neutral	mats despatched fine and as advertised .
neutral	very curt note saying , ' we are not supplying the tonneau cover as it is not suitable for your vehicle '.
neutral	i had to contact the supplier and ask for one that was appropriate for my vehicle , and recieved another curt reply - there is none available for your model of car .
neutral	i found what i needed from another_supplier .
neutral	i ordered a nespresso_machine through them .
neutral	i waited for about 0_days before i rang and asked about whereabouts of my machine as i didn_'_t get a dispatch_notice .
neutral	they told me the item was not in stock and they were waiting for delivery from nespresso .
neutral	that was when i realised if the website said item " available ", that means it is not in stock so we might have to wait for a long time .
neutral	a couple of days_later , i got email from them saying the item was dispatched and was given an_hour_slot for delivery , which i could change if the time was not convenient .
neutral	all was well after the dispatch so i would just make_sure next time if the item is really in stock before i place an order .
neutral	dont ignore the ads , i missed out on a great broadband detail because i went to the standard page which did not have the deal on offer by their ad .
neutral	come on bt put the offer on the page as well
neutral	my order arrived in a box far too_big for it .
neutral	the flimsy single row of sellotape had burst and the box arrived totally open .
neutral	luckily nothing was missing , but better packaging would make a huge_difference .
neutral	the products them selves were great quality & value , just don_'_t know if i can risk another expensive order that gets sent in an open box .
neutral	i bought 0 tickets for boxing on sat .
neutral	traveling friday .
neutral	have been panicking all day , phoned viagogo twice .
neutral	both_times spoke to friendly staff who explained they can come the day before the event , it '_s the individual who has sold viagogo the ticket who hasn_'_t sent them to me yet ( they contacted the seller on the 00st_may to ship them to me , so i dont understand_why the seller holds on to them for so long ).
neutral	they said they would get them sent to the hotel we were staying at in london if they hadn_'_t come by thursday .
neutral	also reassured me i could potentially collect them from the venue if the seller lets me down .
neutral	this evening i have had an_email_saying dispached .
neutral	not got them yet but i '_m feeling slightly more at ease !
neutral	i do feel that the seller should be made to send viagogo the tickets or to the buyer by a decent deadline .
neutral	these tickets have been released ages_ago .
neutral	it '_s really unfair to make us wait to the very last_minute and get so stressed out about it .
neutral	the seller could have easily decided they don_'_t want to sell them anymore - at the last_minute !
neutral	what do they gain from hanging onto them ?
neutral	i don_'_t begrudge paying over the odds for an event of a lifetime but the stress of thinking we ' re not going to get to go is awful .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that the picture on the front of the jigsaw was not the same as the as the actual jigsaw .
neutral	it is a little_confusing for a child to understand that .
neutral	it would have been perfect if that had been the case .
neutral	the company is good on delivery , no_messing_about on stock & delivery .
neutral	when it come '_s to price match , they do not contact you .
neutral	so if you find a product cheaper some where else , buy it .
neutral	do not wait for ao . com to get back to you .
neutral	i ordered some glasses but i sent the wrong prescription , goggles_0u said they would give me a discount if i reordered , i tried to do this , they said if we had a live_chat could get more discount , i did try this but it wasnt available !!
neutral	i have since ordered glasses from another on line company , its a shame because i found the service quick efficient , costumer after care ss let them down , i would think_twice about recomending them to a friend 😞
neutral	current complaint : i do not think that it is made clear that candis take a retention_fee for any cashback earned .
neutral	i do not remember_seeing this anywhere on the website when i first enrolled for cashback .
neutral	it could also be made clearer which outlets provide cashback - many seem to be for on - line purchases and it appears that numerous stores provide this function on - line , but not for actual shopping in store .
neutral	also , can your candis membership card be produced on paying at a till ?
neutral	this is what i understood at first .
neutral	i would be grateful for a concise list of stores / outlets that provide cashback on purchases .
neutral	previous comment / complaint : when i first joined - up , it was to be in time for december , although this did not happen and the letter that arrived confirming my membership had my name spelt incorrectly .
neutral	i have contacted twice about this but not sure if this has_been rectified .
neutral	i really like the variety of items that asos offers , and usually i do not have a problem with asos whatsoever in terms of item quality or pricing .
neutral	one of the reasons i am giving asos 0_stars is because of the unfortunate problem that they still use myhermes .
neutral	i will not go into detail about my horrible_experience with myhermes here - if you click my profile to see my other reviews on trustpilot , you will be able to find my review for myhermes .
neutral	the other reason i am not giving any higher than 0_stars is because of their customer service .
neutral	it is frustrating when there is no contact number and my only options are to wait for a response through email or via their facebook_page , which are usually very slow ( barring the automated_messages saying they have a high_volume of emails ).
neutral	when i had my problem with an order due to myhermes , asos were essentially useless and just asked me to " wait a little_longer " and to contact them if it still had not arrived by a certain_date .
neutral	it did not , so i messaged them back on facebook , only to receive a reply several days_later , after the order finally arrived a week_later than i was told it would .
neutral	of the three queries i sent in via their contact form on their website , only one was responded to by an actual person , and they only told me things i already knew / could find on their website , rather_than answering my actual question .
neutral	my returns experience was hassle - free , and i '_m pleased that i could return items free of charge , with no random fees deducted from my refund , and also that they send a confirmation of receipt of the return .
neutral	due to myhermes being a pain in the bum in regards to standard delivery , i chose to go premier with asos so hopefully i will not have to go through the whole debacle of trying to locate my order again .
neutral	i certainly hope i never have to contact customer_care again , as they are rather useless .
neutral	the goods that i ordered were fine and arrived in a reasonable time .
neutral	however , the reason i would hesitate to buy again from worldstores is that the product descriptions and photographs on their website are really not good enough .
neutral	there is not enough detail about what you are actually getting and the specification of each item is minimal .
neutral	when buying things for the home , i really want to see what it '_s like ; so big , clear photos are very important .
neutral	the items i bought were quite low value and i have seen larger items on worldstores that look really nice .
neutral	however , i cannot consider spending a lot of money online unless i am sure of the quality and features of what i '_m looking at .
neutral	especially when the returns_policy doesn_'_t seem great and i '_m pretty sure you '_d get knobbled for the delivery costs .
neutral	i wasn_'_t impressed with blue_chip holiday '_s booking procedures .
neutral	it should have been made apparent at the beginning of the payment procedure that a credit_card charge would be made .
neutral	transferring payment to my debit_card , which i could easily have used in the first place , was a laborious process .
neutral	subsequently , when i received my credit_card bill , i found the charge hadn_'_t been refunded , so another call to blue_chip .
neutral	it was intensely irritating to receive promotional discounts on seasonal holidays after i had made my ( christmas ) booking , and on ringing , to find out i would not be eligible , since i had already booked and paid , and anyway i had accepted the offer of a christmas_hamper .
neutral	the hamper was a well kept secret at the time of booking , having found it on the website i had to make an extra call .
neutral	not impressed either with property information , specifically_asked if wi_-_fi was available and told it was not .
neutral	i very nearly didn_'_t make the booking , but we did find wi_-_fi and clear_instructions written by the owner .
neutral	it was a lovely apartment , but it had obviously not been checked over for some time , the cleaners left some areas dirty , and there were deficiencies in general maintenance .
neutral	having said all this , blue_chip staff were always pleasant and polite , we had a lovely time and i would book again with blue_chip but only because they have some well placed properties .
neutral	they could do better .
neutral	decided to try eflorist instead of the usual large named company to send to my mum for a birthday surprise .
neutral	easy ordering process and good communications .
neutral	my only_disappointment was the flowers were quite different from the bouquet that was selected .
neutral	i chose this bunch as it was full of purple flowers ( my mum '_s favourite colour ) and contained freesia ( my mum '_s favourite_flower ).
neutral	unfortunately the bunch arrived with lilies and geraniums and more foliage than advertised , all of which my mother tends to dislike about bunches of flowers .
neutral	i understand that the bunches are dependant on supply in the florist but i couldn_'_t really see any resembelance .
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong it was still a nice bunch and my mum said she liked them but they were quite different than the ones chosen .
neutral	i had atext to say the flowers had beed dispatched at 0 . 00am but they didnt get delivered until after 0pm not as good as i thought for the money ......
neutral	i have used the long_stay car_park regularly , for some time now .
neutral	historically , i have been very happy with it .
neutral	park the car , catch a regular bus , with pleasant and friendly bus_drivers , which i do not have to wait long for .
neutral	drop_off in front of the terminal_building - step off the bus and into the terminal , and repeat backwards on return .
neutral	easy .
neutral	pre_- pay online , so no_faffing_about with payments etc .
neutral	until recently - since the airport have decided to utilise a new ' bus teminal ', which inolves a three day camel hike from the bus terminus to the airport_terminal and a similarly lengthy hike on return .
neutral	not happy !!!
neutral	!
neutral	as for paying for fastrack through security - worth_every_penny - especially if travelling with young_children !
neutral	the costume is fine but when paying almost as much for an express delivery , it defeats the purpose when having to sign for it .
neutral	the point of express delivery is needing it quickly , not finding a note that the post_office tried to deliver it and i would now have to wait 00_hours for collecting it .
neutral	it would be much more helpful if we could give an_alternative if the customer was out - such as leaving with a local corner_shop or neighbour .
neutral	the search made it easy to find what i wanted straight_away .
neutral	preferring was simple , the things i ordered came quick but there were things missing of my list .
neutral	i phoned the number from the web_site and couldn_'_t get through , so i emailed my problem , i received a reply that same day and the missing things came the very next working day .
neutral	i might suggest that a phone number be on the delivery note incase of a problem , or more people answering the phone .
neutral	other than that , things i brought were competitive in price .
neutral	we just came off of a 00 day cruise around the british isles where the food was very good .
neutral	judging the food on this river_cruise in comparison to the large cruise_ship food may not be fair , hence my assessment of acceptable british food but not very good .
neutral	the entertainment did over compensate and was very good .
neutral	overall , this was an enjoyable evening and a very nice way to see the london sights .
neutral	although the flowers were nice they did not match the picture on the web_site .
neutral	i do not say there were not the same value but i chosen them for their specific design , not the one that was delivered .
neutral	on this basis i would not order again as i did not like the alternative flower composition .
neutral	the service was good and the flowers were delivered on time , so if you do not mind alternations this service is for you .
neutral	--------------
neutral	an_apology bouquet was sent to the recipient .
neutral	happy with the resolution .
neutral	used a voucher_code from mighty_deals "£ 00 worth of flowers for £_00 "
neutral	i am just glad that i hadn_'_t actually spent £_00 on them , didn_'_t expect them to be delivered in a cardboard_box they were also disappointingly small and just less that 00_hours , the roses and gerbera '_s are wilting and the lilies don_'_t look like they ' re even going to open !
neutral	wish i '_d gone to morrisons , spent the £_00 plus delivery on the beautiful bunches they have !
neutral	item of a very high_standard , as it was a surprise birthday_present i did not want it delivered to my address so chose the nearest_drop address on dock view rd barry .
neutral	they would not accept the delivery , as i had put my telephone_number on the order form the poor delivery man was able to just catch me to arrange for me to drive to his delivery route to pick it up as i was not on his route at my home address .
neutral	lucky i was in to get his call !
neutral	where would my parcel have ended_up ?
neutral	superdry need to check up on their site safe drop_off addresses .
neutral	ordered two basins for bathroom allowing nearly four_weeks for delivery .
neutral	company emailed to say would be delivered 0 / 00 and that they would contact me again on 0 / 00 .
neutral	they did !
neutral	to say delivery would now be 0 / 00 with reconfirmation on 0 / 00 .
neutral	i then contacted them to ask whether holdup would go on ad infinitum .
neutral	was assured would be with me on 0 / 00 .
neutral	it wasn_'_t but at_least this time the local supplier contacted me to say they hadn_'_t received the basins so therefore couldn_'_t deliver to me .
neutral	they estimated it would be the following tues / weds .
neutral	they did finally arrive on the weds , the 0rd day of the bathroom refit !
neutral	i was lucky it was basins and not my shower_tray etc ( ordered elsewhere ) otherwise the refit would have been held up .
neutral	i ordered 000_pounds worth of shoes / sandals they took over a week to arrive , good job i wasn_'_t off on me jollies ... they were well_packaged and the site offers a refund or exchange on any sent back , it will be interesting to see how long that takes ?
neutral	the tin of barbour_wax proofing was sticky and messy .
neutral	i am not certain the contents were the correct weight due to how much wax was in the packaging :( needed to wash hands after opening packet .
neutral	i do think this service is getting poor , i remeber you could get your first bid within 00min it was excepted , not now the bids are ridiclous its laughable , my wife used the same courier , s if she can , courier , s come and go . my wife as used this service for 0yrs , it was great , courier were reliable , you got a good service all_round , i used this service because its straigt_forward but you do wait a long time for a good bid offer
neutral	hi , i booked a 0 day delivery , so it would be delivered on monday as the recipient was home all day .
neutral	the package has_been delivered in less_than 00_hours , normally brilliant , but how can i now be sure that the person concerned is actually going to get the parcel .... a very big parcel at that . pleased with the superfast service at any other time but this 0 day delivery was booked for a reason .
neutral	i received an_email after looking at the virgin experience site saying i could get 00 %.
neutral	when i booked my recent experience i entered the code but the reduction was not made so i am very disappointed but honestly feel i was misled .

neutral	bought my holiday , but no cashback tracked , had to file a claim and was dubious i would get the cashback but it was found eventually and once found paid quickly .
neutral	i '_ve gotten some good deals but have also been burned by some sellers who sell counterfeit ... got to be careful !
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of glasses from googles 0 u and when they turn '_t up my sunglasses were twisted .
neutral	i spoken to member of staff who asked me to take pictures and send them to him , i struggled to do this as my photos were to large , eventually he received them and told me that they would order me a new pair free of charge which was great , but the frames i had were no_longer in stock so i had to search for a new pair .
neutral	when these finally arrived they were also slightly twisted but at this point i gave up and accepted them as they were as the first pair took about 0 / 0_weeks to arrive and then another 0_weeks for these ones to arrive .
neutral	all in all the service from the staff was fantastic and very helpful it was just a shame the glasses were twisted .
neutral	good photos and ordering service , but i was sorely_disappointed that the photographer at the event did not cover the children present more evenly .
neutral	we ( parents ) were told that our children would have ' studio shots ' taken which would be of professional quality .
neutral	on looking through these there were none of my daughter but many of a small number of children ( mostly children of the organisers , interestingly ).
neutral	as the event was my daughter '_s ' prom ' and she was leaving the school at the end of the term i felt obliged to purchase a photo for her so chose the better of the two taken of her .
neutral	bought a bed two_weeks in_advance when moving and bed was due for delivery a week before i moved so i put it back until the day i moved in .
neutral	the bed was supposed to be delivered before 0o /_c .
neutral	well 0o /_c came and went and i called dreams , they said the bed is out of stock and could be another month before it was in . they sad the bed was out of stock when we bought it and they don_'_t know why the transaction went through .
neutral	dreams said they had tried to call but we had given them the wrong number with one too many digits on it .
neutral	i looked at my dreams paperwork and checked that i had given them the number .
neutral	i had given them the right number , they had mistaken the pre printed bracket on their forms as a number 0 .
neutral	well we argued and argued until dreams finally got the bed to us two_weeks late and gave_us a cheque for £_000 .
neutral	it pays to complain and make_sure you write to head_office or they will just palm you off with petty offers .
neutral	demand good service and you will get it .
neutral	well_done in the end dreams .
neutral	good quality beanbags but its a shame there '_s no lining .
neutral	washing the covers will be a nightmare !
neutral	i think it '_s user - friendly but i don_'_t like the amount they deduct every time !
neutral	i feel m & s is a trustworthy store who do care about customer service .
neutral	they offer good value , well_designed products but sometimes their buyers lose the way with their choices !
neutral	i think bt are too_big but we just can '_t avoid using them
neutral	i try not to shop too much at tesco because i don_'_t like their domination .
neutral	they do offer good value products in most_cases but i feel they punish their suppliers to enable this .
neutral	i might be wrong on this but i dont ' think so .
neutral	i ordered riemann p00 once - a - day sunfilter lotion spf00 on the 00th_june , sent a email and phoned on the 00th_june as still not recieved , said it could take up to 0 working_days well it '_s been 0 and still_waiting .
neutral	this is a good site for selling second_hand good and also purchasing .
neutral	it is possible to list ads for items wanted aswell .
neutral	you can post free ads but if you want to promote your ad it will cost .
neutral	you can upload 0 free pics as well for your ad .
neutral	as with things like this always sell face to face and be careful if you are unsure .
neutral	i would recommend as you can find some interesting items on here .
neutral	there are jobs pages aswell .
neutral	update_: i still enjoy looking at gumtree but be very very careful if you are selling , anyone who_asks you to give out your paypal email address because they will give you an extra £_00_-£_00 for postage is scamming you and should be reported immediately .
neutral	i have shopped in hmv a lot over the years and prefer spending my money instore rather_than online .
neutral	when i have ordered online i have either had my item dispatched and recieved within 0_days or i have had to wait 0_days to be dispatched dispite it being in stock .
neutral	this has happened 0 or 0 times and now if not dispatched in the time it states i just cancel and try and find the product elsewhere even if i have to spend a few more pounds .
neutral	one item i did order was meant to be 0 discs but was only a 0 disc cd so they should probably check their product details .
neutral	not sure_whether i would recommend their online service .
neutral	booked an express delivery service to greece .
neutral	the parcel took 0_days to arrive and the tracking_facility stopped on the third day .
neutral	i paid_extra to cover the cost of the parcel and when i started the claim process discovered i could only claim up to 00_% of the value .
neutral	customer service were speedy to respond to emails but when you pay for an express service you expect an express service .
neutral	i would not use this service again .
neutral	title_says it all .
neutral	good prices and delivery but asked a question and still to had a response .
neutral	product took longer_than_expected to be delivered but i understand that this was due to a problem with the supplier .
neutral	was kept_informed of progress but noticed that i had been billed for the lenses before they had even been dispatched .
neutral	i had sent an image which was not good enough quality to proceed with my order ; an_email was sent to in form me as such and requested that i contact them , but this email went into my junk_mail and i did not see it .
neutral	when i then saw an update on my order the expected delivery date had changed until after the date of the event i needed the t - shirts for !
neutral	i was told about the email then and also that there was a notification on my online account .
neutral	so all the bases had been covered by clothes0order .
neutral	my criticism is that unlike a bank_account , or something like facebook , i don_'_t check my account on a daily_basis !
neutral	i do feel that as there was a problem and i had not responded to the email , then surely a follow_up phone_call should have been actioned .
neutral	why would you have to submit your telephone details on your account if not being used ?
neutral	in the end a very helpful young_man did sort the problem out and i received my order a week late to hand out the t - shirts but in time for the actual event , and his intervention was much_appreciated .
neutral	we have used tripsta to book out flights and they were definitely the cheapest flights available with a non - low_cost airline .
neutral	great !
neutral	then for family reasons we had to re - schedule out trip_abroad and so we have contacted the airline thinking of paying a small_fee for amendi g out flights .
neutral	initially we were told that we had to go through tripsta , then from tripsta we were told that for any change , there was going to be a £_00 . 00 penalty fee ( each ) even before checking new flights fares .
neutral	long_story_short , we had to " miss " our flights and book new ones directly from the airline .
neutral	not ideal if you like me travel with family as the expense of amending possibles little mistakes can cost you loads !!
neutral	!
neutral	cheers
neutral	found it a bit_overwhelming and havent been totally happy with all my purchases
neutral	not so much due to yourselves but the 0rd_party , and the process can be confusing .
neutral	too many emails
neutral	i appreciated the ordering process as hassle_free and received my item within a few_days without_any_problems .
neutral	in fact , the postman kindly called me , as i had requested ( so the message was passed on ), and delivered my item to a neighbour on request .
neutral	he had offered to come_back later and called me to confirm that my package was safe .
neutral	however , i ordered an item a size too_big and as there was no smaller stocked item , i requested a refund .
neutral	i called twice and spoke to helpful advisors who clarified i would first be charged_£ 0 for sending my item back ' post free ' on the return_label .
neutral	when , at the post_office , i was told i needed to pay for postage , i called back and was told that £ 0 would not be deducted from my refund for returning my item , and this was followed with an_email_stating i needed to pay to return my item .
neutral	i received an_email today confirming a refund which was £ 0 less_than what i paid .
neutral	????
neutral	not happy !
neutral	and very annoyed that i now have to call and ask for that money back .
neutral	i suspect i will be told ' no '.
neutral	sam was so lovely - very friendly and helpful from_start to finish .
neutral	there were a few mix_ups ... first of all the delivery came after we had closed so i went to pick it up myself , when i got there the front of the t shirts hadn_'_t been printed on , only the backs .
neutral	sam sorted this and got them printed for me .
neutral	all in all great service from sam but a tad disappointed with the mix_ups which delayed us getting the products .
neutral	bought a bulb over 0 years_ago and it suddenly stopped_working .
neutral	it was way below it '_s stated hours that it should last and because it was over 0 years they weren_'_t really interested .
neutral	my other 00 bulbs are still working so it was my opinion that this bulb was faulty in some way , but still not interested .
neutral	the bulb was not cheap and that '_s why i complained .
neutral	ended_up buying another bulb which is different as they no_longer do the original ones i bought .
neutral	very happy with the initial order process .
neutral	got a phone_call to confirm the delivery day and was told that the driver would call an_hour before arrival .
neutral	i never got a phone_call on the day and the unhelpful driver didn_'_t seem to know anything about it ( even_though it also mentioned it on my delivery note ).
neutral	the driver dumped the 00 packs of flooring at my front_door and wouldn_'_t even put them 0 feet inside in the hall so i could shut the front_door !
neutral	i had to move them all myself ( ok so i '_m not an old woman but 00 packs of flooring is not light !).
neutral	he also insisted that i took a large sheet of wood that he said was on top of the delivery .
neutral	i explained that clearly it wasn_'_t for me as my delivery note clearly_stated 00 packs of flooring and 0 packs of underlay but he wouldn_'_t take the wooden sheet with him .
neutral	that '_s another trip to the tip then !
neutral	it '_s a shame that the delivery driver ruining what otherwise would have been a pleasant ordering experience .
neutral	had to wait a week for my new garden set , slow but it has finally arrived
neutral	bought an onkyo mini system from an amazon merchant , took a while to arrive but okay service
neutral	i thought that i would try pet_supermarket as i was a customer of vet uk .
neutral	they were offering the product that i was buying a slightly cheaper price and i thought that i would give it a go .
neutral	i was ordering pet_food and after 0_days , i hadn_'_t received it .
neutral	when i rang i was told that as i was order a dog nail_file which wasn_'_t in stock , they couldn_'_t release the order .
neutral	they were not prepared to send the items individually and i had to cancel the order for the nail_file .
neutral	the food then arrived the following_day a promised .
neutral	vet uk offer a text service and email service to advise you when the goods will be arriving with a time .
neutral	i will needless to say be going back to vet uk
neutral	placed my order but not despatched till 0th_jan also not sure about measurements stated on site think i will now measure the mac which is not waxy but shiny
neutral	the butterflies were tiny compared to competitors ones we ordered last_year , so we had some disappointed customers and we should have checked more carefully ( and price difference did not reflect the size difference )
neutral	there has definitely been a decline in the quality of thee books .
neutral	i have done about 0 now and the colour is really poor compared to original photographs .
neutral	i feel there aren_'_t enough options in the layout either , quite boring layouts so going to start having these photobooks done elsewhere .
neutral	i bought 0 playmobil advent_calendars the boxes seem a bit damp i also bought a musical rattle it was not secure in the packaging but works
neutral	great product when they finally arrived after delay and constant_chasing from me on a delivery date !
neutral	i ordered 0 items and 0 were delivered in good order within a week but i was told that the others were out of stock and would be delivered once available . 0_months later 0 game arrived 0_months later the last of my order was received .
neutral	all games were good quality but i do not think they should advertise games that will take so long to be stocked .
neutral	order taken swiftly and acknowledged by email .
neutral	order placed 0 june and did not receive item until 00 june .
neutral	very slow to process the delivery .
neutral	postage was extortionate , 0 . 00 product was 00 . 00 !
neutral	and wasn_'_t exactly fast , product itself does the job .
neutral	sent these to a friend - she said they were ' nice ', and smelt lovely .
neutral	not exactly the comment i had hoped for .
neutral	she , said a few flowers were already fully out - wouldn_'_t last too long .
neutral	i was disappointed .
neutral	i have had no_problems with the products themselves and delivery is prompt .
neutral	i like that the delivery company they use gives you an_hour_slot they will be arriving in .
neutral	the only problem we have had is with the packaging .
neutral	the larger bags have been fine so far but the 0kg_bags have all broken and have had to be decanted into other containers .
neutral	quality of invitations ( especially coloured imprint faded , not vibrant_colours ) not as expected .
neutral	however , easy to navigate website !
neutral	ordering my christmas_decoration was easy and it was available for collection when it was supposed to be and i am sure it will look beautiful in my garden .
neutral	collecting the item however was alarming . i followed the click and collect sign which was pointing into a dispatch area with forklift trucks flying about . the sign on the gate said hoot your car horn for assistance which i did and i was beckoned into this industrial area and led into the warehouse . it did not feel a safe_environment for a customer to be and i would suggest relocating the click and collect area .
neutral	the clothes were fine but all the same size ordered but some were bigger_than others but all in all very good
neutral	i have had blinds from here before but the most_recent ones don_'_t seem to match up with the quality of the pervious ones , so i '_m a little disappointed .
neutral	the outdoor_lights are supposed to have a weatherproof battery box .
neutral	the screws don_'_t hold it tight , it falls open and i therefore have had to used insulation tape to seal the box .
neutral	tried to order on line but 00_% code not accepted , so had to resort to telephone_enquiry and then able to re - oreder on line .
neutral	goods arrived promptly and i am satisfied with them .
neutral	the chairs have great potential - but as they have not arrived yet we can '_t possibly say how good they - or the company - are .
neutral	there has_been no communication about delivery .
neutral	staff very helpful but the person i dealt_with first had left so you were given a new email address who was on holiday then another person to contact .
neutral	i received my order as promised with an invoice unpaid attached which i paid by credit_card when i placed the ordered i not happy about this .
neutral	there was no contact until item was dispatched .
neutral	i was delighted when it arrived on very prompt on tuesday but unfortunately i had ordered the wrong_size seal it was much too small .
neutral	i spoke to a representatives to ask advice on how i could get a replacement .
neutral	he was very nice and said if i sent it back and also send a piece of the original seal from my shower_door then they would do there best to match it up and despatch it to me at only the cost of the postage which would be about £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i then cut a piece of the seal required and wrote a letter with an explanation of what was needed and placed them both in the tube the seal had been sent to me in .
neutral	i then went to the post_office to send the seal back but was advised because the large tube it had been sent in ( it was the tiniest tube ever ) i would have to pay for parcel_force which was going to cost me £_00 . 00 to post back to you .
neutral	this meant i was going to have to pay £_00 . 00 + 00 . 00 + 0 . 00 = £_00 . 00 rather expensive seal . i sent an_email the support email address and they said this was wrong and it should on be about £ 0 . 00 to send back .
neutral	i took it to post_office again but i still had to pay £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the seal could have been sent in a much smaller package to avoid this , i was impressed at first because of the prompt delivery but it has cost me far too much in the end so i will not be making the same mistake again .
neutral	the product hasn_'_t arrived as yet even_though it was due to be re delivered last wed .
neutral	so cant give you a product review as yet either .
neutral	interlink system for redelivery seems to be lacking in a system some how .
neutral	ordered a dress online .
neutral	it was delivered late first of all and once opened it look nothing like it did online .
neutral	i ordered a it a size larger and it was still hard to get on and off and was very short .
neutral	size '_s are not very accurate at all .
neutral	colours and design allways look different .
neutral	not very good quality for the price .
neutral	ordered a new bank card as mine snapped recieved it 0_days_later in the post was awaiting a new pin to come which never did after ringing them i found out i wouldn_'_t recieve a new one .
neutral	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
neutral	very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england !
neutral	still have not be able to sort_out an issue with the ammount i caan withdraw per day either .
neutral	been ' sent ' out forms that have never arrived .
neutral	i find they are allways helpful when i go instore .
neutral	i ordered my travel_system from them and it arrived on time and all in one parcel which i was happy about as the pushchair was very large .
neutral	i have experienced a couple of problems with the travel_system but as it was brought while 0_months pregnant the are saying ' general issues due to use ' allthough its only been in use for 0_months .
neutral	as i said though the staff are very different in store and can '_t do enough to help you .
neutral	ordered some xmas_presents online .
neutral	the arrived late and allthough i was in the delivery driver left the package with a neighbour and just posted the ' i called but you were not in card through '.
neutral	this has happened on two occasions .
neutral	and very overpriced !
neutral	0 small items for a 0month_old .. over_£_00 !
neutral	my sister loved the flowers and the service good , unfortunately my only_complaint i have about serenata_flowers was the added card i requested .
neutral	all seemed well as i selected the free card and wrote my message , money then taken but i noticed they had charged me for a £ 0 . 00 card that i didn_'_t order .
neutral	there is no way of contacting them to complain .
neutral	the e_- mail '_s they send are no - reply and the phone number you call is permanently_engaged , hence another £ 0 . 00 added to my bill .
neutral	not good .
neutral	the display online looked fabulous and whilst the colour of the flowers were as_described , i was extremely disappointed not to have any lillies in the bouquet , especially as they dominated the picture and therefore ' expected ' them .
neutral	i ordered flowers to be sent to someone coming home from hospital after an operation .
neutral	i requested two balloons to accompany my order .
neutral	the confirmation quoted them as happy birthday balloons when i obviously wanted get well ones .
neutral	i immediately tried to amend the order as per the website but was told the order had already been dispatched so could not be changed .
neutral	i also had a confirmation for chocolates i had not ordered !
neutral	!
neutral	the flowers that were delivered were fine but i would think_twice about another order as i feel the company is not interested in getting things correct and i have also wasted £ 0 . 00 on balloons that were of no use to the recipient .
neutral	the service was excellent product arrived when expected would use them again .
neutral	however was not impressed with product looked cheap and very heavy not light_weight as expected .
neutral	i purchased a few products one which was a fake_tan mit and i did not realise it was only a face one as it didnt state it clearly and it was around 0 / 0 pounds and they are only € 0 to buy in shops for the big ones , i wasn_'_t happy with thatc
neutral	i like jokers_masquerade and have used them before .
neutral	they were quick with the delivery and the website is very user_friendly and easy to navigate .
neutral	my only issues were that i ordered a medium in an outfit , and there was no sizing information on the site for the item , but the size that came was an 0 - 00 - which is ridiculous .
neutral	it is detailed as a medium on the packaging too , stating that a small is a 0 - 0 , large is 00 - 00 etc .
neutral	this sizing is absolutely ridiculous .
neutral	had to return the item , and was a bit odd to have to get an authorisation_code via_email before i could return the package - especially as there is a very short timescale for returns .
neutral	i '_d definitely recommend slickening up this process .
neutral	also had to pay for return delivery which was quite_expensive .
neutral	we do a lot of fancy_dress events every year , and i '_m not sure if i '_d use the company again or not .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	really good service from go_electrical .
neutral	i love my kitchenaid_mixer , and the free knives are a lovely bonus !
neutral	poor service from dpd - they didn_'_t deliver on first scheduled day , and gave no reason for this , which was incredibly_frustrating , given i was waiting at home all afternoon and evening for the parcel .
neutral	i wasn_'_t in when my parcel arrived so it went back to the distribution_centre several miles_away .
neutral	i couldn_'_t be in for another delivery to the house .
neutral	if cosmetics now would use royal_mail i could have gone locally to the delivery office .
neutral	one more gripe .
neutral	the plunge dispenser had somehow been pushed down despite bubble_wrap and the conditioner had leaked .
neutral	i was surprised that it wasn_'_t a sealed container .
neutral	without a seal , although i recognise the colour , smell etc of this product , it could be anything in the bottle , which is worrying ..
neutral	delivery said could be between_0am and as late as 0pm during busy_periods such as valentines / mothers_day and my order was for mond 00st oct ( no special date that i could see ) i expected delivery to be sometime during that day , before 0pm .
neutral	unfortunately the delivery was not ' till nearly 0pm when , like many people do on their ' special day ', had already left to celebrate !
neutral	i received a text to say the flowers had been left ' at rear of property in a secure_location ', they were left in fact , on the door_step in full_view of the road !
neutral	luckily they were still there when my mum returned .
neutral	more by luck than judgement !!
neutral	i e_- mailed customer_services with my comments which they noted and apologised for but no offer of any compensation for my disappointment .
neutral	i would have been happy to maybe have been offered a discount on any other order i may have placed .
neutral	however , i wasn_'_t happy with the way in which the flowers were delivered .
neutral	i ordered roses for my elderly_mother '_s birthday .
neutral	my brother in law came home at 00 . 00_pm and discovered them on the front step .
neutral	my sister had been in all evening and didn_'_t hear the doorbell ( she has a dog who always barks when the doorbell rings ).
neutral	if the flowers had been left out all night they would have probably died .
neutral	i live in canada and any time that i have been sent flowers someone from the shop telephones first to make_sure that you will be home .
neutral	surely that makes the most sense .
neutral	this is the second time that the flowers have been left_outside .
neutral	i doubt that i will use serenata again .
neutral	i will not be using them again which is a shame as they keep you update and tell you when the flowers have been delivered
neutral	i joined cash_back because my mother was saying how good and quick and easy it is to make money for shopping .
neutral	so i joined .. for some reason most my retailers don_'_t seem to track and when they do it takes_forever to get payout ..
neutral	i cant really complain because its money for nothing but most really i would not join if the cash_back was so good but hence they don_'_t track and have to open up claims .. cant bame cash_back but the sellers should not be on the site .
neutral	i ordered an new ipad on 00th_december with free_postage in 0 / 0 working_days .
neutral	received email on 00rd_december ( 0_days_later ) suggesting i track delivery with dhl .
neutral	on doing so needed to telephone dhl as tracking showed item was being held pending payment .
neutral	had to pay £_00 for customs_clearance before item could be cleared for delivery .
neutral	was informed by dhl that seller should have informed me that customs_clearance would be payable , there was never any mention of this .
neutral	not only did i have to pay an_unexpected £_00 but because of the hold up the package was not delivered until today , not 0 / 0_days but 00 days and not in time for christmas as expected .
neutral	one the strength of one short phone_call i can '_t say much - the guy was pleasant and polite .
neutral	however this email arrived addressed to mrs jill carey when actually my name is mrs jill carey - stuart - i hope that any paperwork prepared by your company includes my carrect name or it '_ll have to be sent back !
neutral	order was very efficient and came safely but unfortunately the bulb , although it is the correct number on the fly killer itself , does not fit !
neutral	?
neutral	?
neutral	was pretty good .
neutral	commentary got repetitive .
neutral	showed a good variety of the city .
neutral	i cannot_fault made for customer service .
neutral	however i was only able to enjoy one of the items i ordered , the merido rug .
neutral	the tallboy i ordered was going to take 00 - 00 weeks to be delivered .
neutral	which was just too long for my purposes .
neutral	the sofabed has_been returned - one of the legs was positioned so it faced inwards rather_than out affecting the stability of the sofabed .
neutral	the cover material was professional dry clean only , or , sweep with brush / hoover .
neutral	i could not trust myself to enjoy a coffee if i could not use a damp clothe to remove any staining .
neutral	and , then the click and position upright mechanism to convert to a sofa stopped_working .
neutral	sleeping involved lying on a hard wooden structure in the centre of the sofabed ; not comfortable for even short_term use .
neutral	the rug however , i am chuffed with .
neutral	and , it is made under the ' care and fair ' label , which promotes the welfare of children , and so no child labour is used .
neutral	the wool of the rug is very soft and springy .
neutral	so , despite my unhappiness with the tallboy and the sofabed , three stars !
neutral	you need to review the checkout_procedure for existing_customers who forget their password .
neutral	even_though it looked well_packed , when we came to open it , it had been twisted , presumably during_transit .
neutral	we managed to straighten it but it was still disappointing .
neutral	i was very disappointed with the flowers i ordered for my stepdaughters birthday , i expected a big bouquet and it turned_out to be just a very small one , not like it was on the picture .
neutral	delivery service good but ordered magimix toaster which did not work on delivery - no power .
neutral	has_been collected and awaiting further_action .
neutral	really disappointed that product was not tested and faulty goods were despatched .
neutral	the trip to calais was fine due to less people on the ferry !
neutral	the ferry was late in dover on the way back and the passport check on the trip from calais was slow !
neutral	the lifts where not working !
neutral	had one order cancelled , still_waiting for another after 00 days , not happy so far .
neutral	have emailed store to find out but not had a response as yet .
neutral	everything was good , except for additional_fees for different credit_cards , but other that the service was good ...
neutral	great value for money , but a few things did let us down .
neutral	one of the taps was missing from the box , we then had to go and pick it up ourselves .
neutral	when talikng to customer service trying to solve it , lady was very rude and unhelpful .
neutral	at the end of the day they replaced tap with a slightly_different one , so design is not matching the bath_tap .
neutral	then when it came to tiles i bought them with the border only to realise it '_s too thick to go with my tiles .
neutral	but i was not advised that it wouldn_'_t go with the tiles i have chosen .
neutral	so a little things going wrong here and there made shopping_experience with better_bathrooms a stressful one .
neutral	went ok .
neutral	wheels were not balanced correctly first time and he had to come_back to do it again .
neutral	all fixed though and would use again .
neutral	fine .
neutral	i ordered what i thought was the correct_size of harness , having measured my dog '_s chest , and it turned_out to be far too_big .
neutral	ordering the frontline was fine .
neutral	reasonably swift shipping .
neutral	i had a terrible experience with a cowboy retailer .
neutral	i could not understand how they could have so many good reviews when they are so unhelpfull , and i revied them negatively ( but fairly ).
neutral	all they had to do was to report my review and now noone can see it till it is put back , and then it will be at the bottom of the tread , so noone will know ...... a bit too easy for the retailer to manipulte i think ...... trustpilot should not take down reviews without having looked at them in my opinion .
neutral	i found the service the easiest and quickest of several other similar_websites .
neutral	i am going to see one direction in may and booked the tickets in january we have paid £_000 for 0 tickets my friend booked them though but i am not sure if they are real as i am a massive directioner and the first concert i have ever gone to .
neutral	can any tell ether they will be real or not
neutral	arrived promptly well_packed .
neutral	on opening black baubles lots were marked with silver discoloration .
neutral	had to thread all 00 - gave up with poor quality thread supplied all knotted up .
neutral	individual shoe ornaments fab but will never buy baubles from this company again .
neutral	only_negative i have had with the service was as soon as i confirmed the purchase i realized i accidentally paid with my credit_card not my debit_card .
neutral	i called immediately and was advised that for whatever_reason they were not able to change the card over .
neutral	no explanation as to why they couldn_'_t do this was given to me .
neutral	the galaxy bar_stools look very stylish and are a great price compared to other_suppliers but they are finished poorly so it is a trade - off on price vs quality .
neutral	some of the pre_- drilled_holes were messy and made it very difficult to get the screws in .
neutral	the trim is cut short leaving fairly sharp edge but it is on the underside so unlikely to cause harm .
neutral	i am not sure how long the trim will stay in the groove it is put in as it is not fixed there with adhesive so doesn_'_t seem secure .
neutral	delivery was great , packaged well , just the smaller details let this product down a bit .
neutral	the main difficulty when booking in_advance from outside of the uk is the requirement to enter a car make and registration when this won_'_t be known until the car is hired much closer to the time of travel .
neutral	i was disappointed that you did not have the stock level you stated on your website .
neutral	however , i was pleased that you contacted me to inform_me .
neutral	unfortunately , searching for your stock clearly took time and this delayed dispatch .
neutral	i would use castleberg_outdoors again .
neutral	i chose animed_direct as the price was great but saw that the free delivery was 0nd_class .
neutral	as i wanted the item quickly i chose their express delivery at an extra £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i ordered thursday_morning online but then didn_'_t receive my " express " parcel until tues_pm .
neutral	surely its not beyond the wit of man to do better_than this , even 0st_class snail_mail is faster .
neutral	come on animed , you are hurting your business with the slow " express "............ lots of other comments like this already !
neutral	!
neutral	i was thrilled to try out this method of quitting_smoking conventional cigarettes .
neutral	at first it did save a lot of money .
neutral	however of late the company is constantly_updating their products and the new models are unrliable and so becoming too expensive to continue with .
neutral	i am almost at the brink of changing allegience to another company .
neutral	have used tesco practically since their beginning when they stacked them high ( not on shelves but in cardboard cartons ), defended their foods to my sister who uses sainsburys , loved their clubcard vouchers , used tesco bank - but sorry they are losing it for me and in the last 0_months i now get my shopping delivered by sainsburys or waitrose .
neutral	it started with some of their tesco_finest meals , not quite what was expected from their premier range - eg aberdeen_angus steak pasta - in fact a small_amount of mince in a pasta bake .
neutral	but anything i can quote is just my opinion - just my disappointment .
neutral	so tonight i went to their wine by the case - i had a £_00 voucher to spend - was immediately hooked by their ' extra 00_%_off mixed cases ' - but extra off what ?
neutral	after_spending half hour trying to see exactly_what bargain i might be getting i have finally given up on tesco - totally .
neutral	in a nutshell i don_'_t trust them any more , from the quality of their food to their slogans / bargains - and why should i have to use facebook to lodge an opinion ?
neutral	for me a sad passing of an era really , 0000 - 0000 rip
neutral	i purchased some flowers from serenata for mother '_s day and paid premium for sunday delivery .
neutral	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn_'_t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn_'_t as special .
neutral	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
neutral	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
neutral	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use serenata_flowers again .
neutral	customer service very good and helpful , however id think about chaning your courier service
neutral	no_hassle dropping your car off or picking it up , very quick n easy .
neutral	you just have to get lucky with the drop_off / pick_up times they run every 00_mins i '_d say more like 00mins , but wsnt too much of a n issue ... would use again
neutral	having taken gees linctus since_childhood , and found there is nothing to compare with it for soothing a really bad chesty cough , i was horrified to find that chemist '_s no long stock it ...... however , still available on the chemist_direct website .
neutral	since then , i have found that most products i need are available here , and all at excellent prices , though at times , if one wants to make a small purchase , the postage is a little prohibitive .
neutral	it was a good experience expected more money for the phone thought
neutral	the service was great , it was very quick and very reasonable .
neutral	however i spoke to the recipient and they said that the flowers were just left on the doorstep , and after 0_days the roses started to droop .
neutral	overall i am impressed and would use the service again .
neutral	i did order with yourselves and paid a lot in postage but unfortunately never arrived in time and had to buy another custom elsewhere ..
neutral	i have resent custom back to yourselves ...
neutral	i just need to remember to order from you weeks in_advance
neutral	i ordered trousers for my nephews_birthday and had them sent direct to him .
neutral	they arrived promptly but the popper fastening was broken .
neutral	after sending them back a replacement pair were quickly sent .
neutral	they are a nice item and the service was very good .
neutral	surgery day ok , follow_ups ok , as time has_gone on though not ok .... left has not worked , cannot see very well at all , using eye_drops constantly now for a year .
neutral	offered further surgery once dryness is better , but i don_'_t really want to have it done as i am scared it will get worse .
neutral	i fell like i am a bit of a ' number ' rather_than me .
neutral	saved 00 months to have this done and only one eye is ok [ not as good as with contacts ] and left eye cannot see distance .
neutral	would rather have half the fee back and buy glasses for tv and driving etc .
neutral	wish i had listened to my friends and family and spent the money on something_else £ 0 , 000 not well spent , very sad and disappointed .
neutral	fast delivery service but when i received the game it did not come with any cellophane_wrapping or promotional leaflets usually put in ps0_games , prompting me to think these games may infact be second_hand .
neutral	the estimated delivery time was 0 / 0_days .
neutral	in fact it was 0 .
neutral	no explanation or apology offered .
neutral	this is the second time we have experience slow delivery times from lenstore .
neutral	order was placed and i received an_email a few_days_later to say item was being delivered on a certain day .
neutral	that day came and went so i called only to be told that the item was short delivered and some deliveries were not sent .
neutral	i was informed that a new order would be raised but would take another week .
neutral	i was disappointed that i was not informed and that i had to chase delivery .
neutral	item finally arrived , without notification , around 00 days_later .
neutral	i was delivering of my goods as stated on the email i had received , 0_days after that a knock came to my door , me thinking it was the delivery driver opened the door , took delivery , when the person_who had brought it advised that he actually lived in the next road which is called meadowcroft road , i am mighty grateful to him as he could have just got rid of it , i don_'_t know how you can deliver goods to a wrong_address when it was clearly_stated on the parcel where it was going , yodel , get your act_together
neutral	other than that my dog is happy with the food , would have been excellent service if delivered correctly .
neutral	some of the information the sales_assistants gave_me was conflicting or incorrect , better knowledge of the prams i felt was needed .
neutral	not being_able to physically buy a pram on a sunday due to warehouse being shut was frustrating , we also requested a call when our required model would be in which never happened .
neutral	these are all small points but areas that i feel could be improved for better service .
neutral	the sales_assistants were very friendly , attentive and helpful and look very smart in uniform .
neutral	i liked that we could take the shop model pram outside and check how it fits in the car .
neutral	it sounded so simple !
neutral	if only order accepted delivery witin 00_hrs then silence debit appeared in bank_account but no meds and no emails so very unhappy i contacted customer_services at this point they were excellent seems emails_telling_me i needed to speak to a doctor were in spam logged back in and had to communicate with doctor via a chat box which was a nightmare as it kept cutting off my paragraphs finally had order confirmed but meds still took 0_days now i know !
neutral	customer_services great at sorting stuff but i
neutral	did this for ease of ordering and it became very stressful amd hard i think it needs to be said on the website to check spam and also to be made clear that whatever the order there is always a requirement to communicate with the doctor and make lots of statements re promising to contact own gp etc
neutral	i recently_purchased from partsmaster fusible discs for my pressure cooker in the pack there are three discs they are minute price off £ 0 . 00 ok postage £ 0 . 00 unbelievable these discs would fit quite safely in a small standard envelope
neutral	great site , excellence quality of product but disappointed with delievery of product it took over 00 days to arrive and the item was in stock when ordered !
neutral	i was told my dive_computer was coming on the tuesday so waited in all day , eventually at five thirty i rang and spoke to a staff_member , he then realised it was still i the shop , he assured me it would be sent the following_day .
neutral	unfortunately he forgot so i waited in all day on the thursday again , but still no watch .
neutral	he rang me to tell me but that was quite late in the day , finally it arrived on friday but i had to wait in for 0_days for it !
neutral	the staff were very friendly and i would use them again but i had an unlucky experience .
neutral	no compensation for 0_days stuck indoors .
neutral	i was very pleased with the invitations as they looked exactly as i wanted them to look .
neutral	however , i was disappointed that five or six of the invitations were basically spoiled and unuseable .
neutral	the ink either from the printer or on the design itself seemed to have run slightly so the invitations had very noticeable marks on them .
neutral	so i didn_'_t feel that it would be appropriate to send these to my guests .
neutral	i had ordered more invitations than i needed just in case , but this was obviously not the reason that i did that and it seems a shame that i can '_t use these invitations as it '_s a waste of my money .
neutral	otherwise though , i was pleased with the general appearance of the invitations and delivery etc was all very satisfactory .
neutral	i ordered 0 items online on 00nd_march .
neutral	0 item was delivered within 00 days but the other 0 items had expected delivery dates of 00th_may and 00nd june !
neutral	h_& m sell good quality items but do yourself a favour , buy instore as the online set_up is abysmal .
neutral	i have just cancelled the remainder of my order as i am not prepared to wait 0_months from the date of order until delivery .
neutral	animed_direct have pretty fair prices however their service was spoilt on 0 counts .
neutral	firstltly they don_'_t post to cyprus which is part of the eu ...
neutral	they post to other destinations but not cyprus .
neutral	not even when i emailed them direct .
neutral	what would it have taken to take my order and send out a small package .
neutral	secondly ... animed use 0nd_class_post within the uk ..... penny pinching and slow delivery does not attract customers ..... good customers service does
neutral	great service
neutral	my flowers were ordered and they were very efficient with the confirmation and text etc ; but the people who delivered the flowers never rang the bell and just left them in the pouring_rain on the doorstep .
neutral	fortunately my family were in and saw the car drive off and went to the door straight_away .
neutral	i have yet to have any_problems after years of use .
neutral	a indispensable gift site all year ' round but a must visit at crimbo .
neutral	having used ebookers for the first time recently , we have found that their rates are definately the cheapest we could find for a good range of hotels and flights .
neutral	although we booked online we did call them a couple of times for some advice and found after_speaking with 0 representatives in their offshore call_centres that they seem to be reading from a call script with not much knowledge past that provided on the website .
neutral	compared with trailfinders and other similar providers they could do with a wider_range of experience and a more personable service however i suppose you get what you pay for and they are cheap !
neutral	sent some things off and got a credit_note email quickly .
neutral	ordered some games but had to pay first then send off credit_note after delivery received .
neutral	still_waiting for my account to be credited .
neutral	must be a better way to deal with this
neutral	i was expecting a better quality item , better packaging etc .
neutral	the carry_case is cheap plastic , smells cheap and synthetic .
neutral	the brushes aren_'_t labelled , so i '_m not sure which brush is used for what .
neutral	dissapointing ....
neutral	have had some really good juice ( menthol and banana ) but vermillion river menthol tasted nothing like menthol and standard blueberry tasted of very little .
neutral	always quick delivery though
neutral	considering you told me i would have my voucher_code emailed to me on the 00th and i still_haven_'_t received it to be able to redeem my item ... not very good .
neutral	i took fast delivery from go_electrical for a bosch_vacuum_cleaner last_week .
neutral	great , so pleased with service i emailed them to compliment them !
neutral	when i assembled the cleaner there appeared to be fault with height adjustment - unbelievable , a quality product with a fault !
neutral	i rang go and at first the person_who answered my call did appear to want to help with what i thought were misleading directions in the attached booklet .
neutral	i waited on the line and she quickly ( i was told afterwards ) used one on the shop floor to help me .
neutral	no direction from her solved the situation but then everything went down_hill .
neutral	her work was obviously piling up and as she said the situation had to go to customer service department .
neutral	she emailed me a form which i duly tried to complete but in the end had to email directly as the software did not respond ( small_print stated if i was not able to type into the boxes send direct !)
neutral	could they please update this system !
neutral	i sent the mail explaining my situation ie bought a vacuum_cleaner which did not work expecting a fast response and a way to solve things - what i got was a automated_response saying they would mail bosch and let_me know what they suggested !
neutral	not good enough , how long was i supposed to wait !
neutral	and so - to sort the problem i had to then contact bosch themselves who eventually accepted there was a probable fault and agreed to forward the problem part .
neutral	i had to insist ( with bosch ) that they express the part to me and indeed the new part arrived the next_day proving the product delivered to me in the first_instance was faulty .
neutral	i think go should have given more customer support to me - if i had not been able to independently contact bosch i would have been left with a product which i could not use and i had paid go £_000 for the privilege !
neutral	this cannot be right .
neutral	i believe there is room for improvement if the policy schedule could include phone no .
neutral	outside uk and inside uk for emergency assistance or reporting a claim .
neutral	presently the above phone no .
neutral	are in the policy booklet of 00 pages and it is not easy to take it with other travelling documents .
neutral	other travel_insurance co . seem to include the above information on their policy schedule or validation cert .
neutral	which is more convenient .
neutral	this is only a suggestion and i hope it will be helpful .
neutral	i booked 0 people in 0 different flights , need vegatarian on all and aj was very good but he had to keep putting me on hold .
neutral	my daughters ticket went up by £_00 pounds which seems alot but by then i was in middle of the booking or would have tired elswhere .
neutral	you need to be able to give a price and keep to it , just think £_00 was a lot and it has cost me alot more than i wanted to pay .
neutral	i was generally happy with the service - i liked that i received a text_message with an update of the order at every_step of the way .
neutral	the price was also decent and delivery was free which is always a bonus .
neutral	i was troubled to hear that the flowers had been left_outside the door and not delivered to the recipient in person .
neutral	the recipient is disabled and in a wheelchair .
neutral	in the end a family friend who was visiting found the flowers and brought them in .
neutral	for this reason only i probably_wouldn_'_t use this company again .
neutral	all was ok in the end , but we purchased the item believing it to be ' in stock ' as was detailed on the website .
neutral	this was not the case , and so the website listing was inaccurate and not up to date .
neutral	there wasn_'_t much of a wait , but i did have to phone 0 times to get to the bottom of things .
neutral	they did email when they said they would , so no_complaints there .
neutral	it would have been a much_better transaction if i '_d known the item wasn_'_t in stock from the outset .
neutral	free wifi only worked 0 out of 00 days .
neutral	tv_channels so restricted ( no viewing card ) that it wasn_'_t worth switching the tv on .
neutral	the cleaners only cleaned once in the whole fortnight - didn_'_t even clean outside then .
neutral	had to provide our own bin_bags and toilet_rolls .
neutral	quite a shame because the resort was lovely .
neutral	wanted to print my christmas cards , but all came out very blue , so cannot use them
neutral	whats the point of paying for postage then because of the p / f stupid rules the postman cannot leave a package no matter_how safe ur property so u have to go and collect it .......... so whats the point of paying for delivery ?
neutral	i think because of the lack of trust in their own deliverers isn_'_t that what they ' re saying ( we don_'_t trust u enough to really leave the package u only said u did ) so perhaps it '_s time uk followed the american way ......... large metal boxes for post of all_kinds .
neutral	was t expecting to have to wait over 0_weeks for my glasses and had to chase twice to find out details .
neutral	would be good to over communicate to customers to keep them in the loop .
neutral	also if the glasses were out of stock and had to be bought from the supplier then the website needs to reflect this .
neutral	very good selection - competitively_priced - but on one item i found cheaper on other_sites they would not price match " even_though they advertise not to beaten on price " as there was a 00_% offer on ?
neutral	that was there stance and refused to budge - even_though i spent over_£ 0 , 000 which was a shame as i was in 0 minds to cancel the order and go to other_suppliers but because of timings and i needed the goods asap i had to bite me bottom lip and order - other wise it would have been a great experience had they reduced the item to price match - bit of a shame really " its the little gestures that keep customers coming_back
neutral	i ordered a number of appliances for my new_kitchen earlier in the year and had no less_than 00 phone_calls , emails , text_messages etc .
neutral	about my purchases .
neutral	it got a little annoying to say the least and i vowed_never to use them again , however ... when push came to shove the prices are good and at_least you know what is happening with your delivery .
neutral	so , when i needed to replace my washing_machine , they had the deal i wanted so i bit the bullet .
neutral	i wasn_'_t surprised therefore when the phone rang ten_minutes after_placing my washing_machine order .
neutral	in all , the products and service are good and they do keep you informed about everything .
neutral	they are also good value so i would always recommend them with the caviat that you will be bombarded for a few_weeks .
neutral	overall the service was ok i did contact customer_services on several_occasions as my cashback was very late .
neutral	i eventually got my cashback and wasn_'_t told i would pay a £ 0 admin_fee :-( so that was a little_disappointing .
neutral	delivery came finally after having to wait months as item had not been in stock and it took two months to get it back in .
neutral	deliver was good , was told best way to unpack it , but had trouble as men had bought it in back to front so had to try and change the big box around correctly once it was in .
neutral	furniture was packed well to protect it and had lots of padding around to prevent it getting damaged .
neutral	not flexible for example i have annual_insurance for 0 but only i ski so when i asked for a week add on for me to ski the answer was just a straight no .
neutral	my partner recently started medication for hypertension when i spoke to them about this it doubled the cost of the policy .
neutral	have new and better cover policy with lv and will be cancelling columbus policy
neutral	i saw the advert on group on for personalised mugs and decided i would like to buy 0 of them , however buying them was a bit of a pain as i had to purchase a group on voucher for 0 . and 0 . i then had to place this as 0 separate_orders on the jessops web_site which_meant i had 0 delivery fees despite al the mugs arriving at the sae time from the one delivery man so seemed a bit of a con and could have been simplified greatly had i been able to order 0 mugs in one order and enter both vouchers at the same time .
neutral	i also phoned the helpline and got the same answer .
neutral	also found the £ 0 fee on top of each mug for the transfer to be a hidden cost as this was not made clear until payment
neutral	the flowers were okay , i am not a flower lover buts i wanted to say thanks to my sisters who do like flowers .
neutral	i ordered on line and when the flowers arrived i was a bit disappointed , as i expected more in the bunch .
neutral	it certainly looked more in the ad .
neutral	my sisters were pleased isth them and that is what mattered in the end !
neutral	because i neglected to get the registration date of the owners v0 before we parted company this did not match on the final certificate .
neutral	no email_stating that the order had been accepted or despatched .
neutral	the items arrived quickly enough and were the correct items .
neutral	i emailled the company regarding being charged for postage and they basically said " tough it was my fault for not looking around the site for the free delivery option "
neutral	it wasnt quite what i expected , it had two parts rather_than one .
neutral	i had trouble trying to get the bat wings on and broke one of them because they were far too tight .
neutral	i still cant figure_out how to wear them and i will have to make some straps myself which actually fit .
neutral	otherwise the rest of the outfit was great and looked great with fishnets .
neutral	we had good experience in the past with villa_plus but it seems the standards have slipped cleanliness just not up to scratch this time .
neutral	great products , great uk prices but deliveries can be a bit haphazard - wrong items delivered , embarrassing when it was a gift .
neutral	items not delivered to me and returned to beauty_bay , but nothing done until i chased .
neutral	beware if you are like me a brit living in the eu , paying in sterling with a uk card but charged higher prices than the website .
neutral	you may get free delivery but expect an increased item price .
neutral	not at all clear from the site !
neutral	i '_ve made two orders with seraphine and now have a dress , vest and a pair of trousers .
neutral	quality , fit and price are great .
neutral	however , i had huge problems getting hold of my orders which i understand was due to them moving warehouse and experiencing some problems .
neutral	this is fair_enough but it took four emails or me to get any information and my second order and to actually get it dispatched , information was very vague at first but they eventually fedex '_d my delivery out as a next_day after two_weeks .
neutral	i would give them another go as i '_ve discovered nice maternity_clothes are quite hard to find , but if i experience any further delivery problems i '_d probably give it up .
neutral	the curtain packaging quoted one size but the curtains were another !
neutral	!
neutral	they smelled very strongly of tobacco smoke - had to wash them before i could hang them !
neutral	i think someone had repackaged whilst having a quick cigarette !
neutral	i can not comment on the because is not delivered yet ...
neutral	very pleased with my product adobe mixer_taps , but delivery took about a week which was longer_than_anticipated .
neutral	as it happened my kitchen refurb has_been delayed so it didn_'_t matter in the end .
neutral	i waited in all day as no time for delivery was mentioned , at 0pm i went online to track the parcel only to find it had been delivered next door at 00 . 00am that morning ???
neutral	?
neutral	they don_'_t do the prescription i need , apparently it '_s somewhere on the website but i didn_'_t see it .
neutral	my experience with waltons was not a good one .
neutral	i placed an order that was said to be delived the next_day tomorrow came and went no contact from anyone to inform_me as to why my order had not been delivered .
neutral	after several phone_calls i was told it might be delivered on monday 0_days after order , as luck would have it i took delivery on the saturday , and was given a 00 . 00 pound refund , not what i would call proffesional service
neutral	ordered 0 x l ' oréal horizon fix hairsprays and 0 x l ' oréal mythic oil .
neutral	only two hairsprays and the oil have arrived and have had no response to my email chasing it up .
neutral	would be_happier if i had some communication .
neutral	needed hoovering but potentially very nice .
neutral	i purchased flowers for a lady suffering a mental breakdown as it is her_birthday this weekend and needed something to cheer_her up .
neutral	i choose what i thought was a lovely bunch of flowers and paid to upgrade to deluxe .
neutral	i have seen them and i am very disapointed with them .
neutral	you would get a better bunch from a supermarket these days .
neutral	not very happy ..........
neutral	easy to order .
neutral	bought some zildjian gen 00 symbols for my husband for his_birthday .
neutral	they were extremely competitively_priced and the purchase online was smooth and simple .
neutral	the item was delivered as arranged and i was impressed with the specific time slots that the courier was able to advise on .
neutral	however , upon the package being opened we discovered that the power_supply lead that was sent as incompatible and the back plate was not supplied .
neutral	i rang customer_services the next_day and was
neutral	told that they would arrange for the correct power unit to be forwarded to me but that the back plate was not supposed to be included .
neutral	this may have been down to me calling it the clamp ( i '_m not aufait with drumming speak !).
neutral	my husband them called them again to tell them that i had made a mistake in what i was trying to tell them and he was told that someone would call him back .
neutral	he is still_waiting two_weeks_later .
neutral	i '_m not suggesting that this makes them an unreputable company , but i am disappointed with the way that this had been handled .
neutral	was fairly cheap and easy to do .
neutral	but when i contacted serenata_flowers to ask if a note could be put on the order to say that my friend would definitely be in after 0pm , they were quite offhand with the reply and refused to help .
neutral	i didn_'_t want a guaranteed after 0pm delivery , i just wanted a note made of it just in case the driver was able to be flexible .
neutral	the delivery was really quick and the prices were excellent .
neutral	although i ordered a wenda wally outfit and the material was really cheap and also had a hole in the side that i had to repair as i urgently_needed the outfit .
neutral	not worth the amount i paid .
neutral	the spider outfit and ninja outfit i bought were good quality though .
neutral	i searched for a smoking room - when i confirmed my booking it was 000_% no smoking hotel - bit misleading
neutral	the site offers a vast_range of costumes to choose from , however larger_sizes ( 00 plus ) are limited .
neutral	i ordered a costume that promised to be 00 - 00 , which i thought would be fine , given that i '_m more towards a 00 , however the costume was very tight especially around the arms and bust_area .
neutral	i would say pick a size larger than you need , but again , the larger_sizes are limited .
neutral	delivery was very quick .
neutral	the boots when they arrived were in excellent condition
neutral	nb when the web_site says ' free next_day delivery ', it actually means it will leave there warehouse the same or next_day .
neutral	it still took 0_days to be delivered .
neutral	website is not always working correctly , i thought i had placed an order , only to discover it had not gone_through , waited a week and sent an_email to customer_services and did not ever receive a reply ,
neutral	be careful when ordering on the web_site
neutral	hi there , i cant_fault your service the flowers arrived as booked , but today i visited the people i sent these flower to and was very disappointed , not with the flowers themselves but with the amount of them , or should i say the lack of amount , i didnt see them as they arrived and supposed they were grandly wraped in fancy paper but they looked very measly and i wish i had gone to one of the supermarkets and chose a bouquet as thier £_00 ones had more than twice as many flowers with very pretty presentation paper and with more varity .
neutral	in the actual flowers themselves
neutral	sorry this is not a good review but it how i felt about them
neutral	regards
neutral	lovely flowers but very disappointed there was so little flowers i have used your company three_times_now but i think i might go back to arena flowers very disappointed as i sent them to my daughter for a christmas_present .
neutral	i have used cheap_smells a number of times , my order has always been here super quick .
neutral	this order when time was a little tight for the birthday that the perfume was for it is taking a long time for the order to arrive .
neutral	i am no getting a little_worried that i will have to go out and but another present .
neutral	the bag is what i expected and the service was good .
neutral	but the bag was squashed into the packaging box which was too small for the item - therefore the bag is badly_creased .
neutral	shame !
neutral	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !
neutral	?
neutral	to my shock i was informed 0_days prior to leaving from cork for kildare for laser_eye_surgery that i could not use direct_debit option as i had initially planned , i was told that financial company had ceased and therefore my only option was to come up with a lump_sum on day of surgery which was roughly euro 0000 !!!
neutral	i can admit it was a very stressful few_days , i felt bad having to ask parents , family and even friends to help out , a bank fortunately approved a loan however i felt hard done by by optical_express and offered me no options other than to cancel my procedure although i had booked time off work over a bank_holiday_weekend !!!!
neutral	went_ahead with it once sorted and the eye_surgery_itself was grand , quick and easy and met lovely nursing staff in kildare .
neutral	that '_s worth of it to sell some old_mobiles & give money to charity .
neutral	:-))
neutral	i had very mixed experience with very .
neutral	the first time i ordered a jumper to try them out was extremely bad .
neutral	i had chosen a sat for delivery as i work during weekdays .
neutral	i waited from 0am to 00pm on saturday and guy did not turn_up .
neutral	i rang them and they simply told me the guy cudnt find the no so left .
neutral	that was such a feeble excuse and its absolutely rubbish .
neutral	however , eventually the coat turned_up late_afternoon .
neutral	however , my second experience with them turned_out rather good .
neutral	delivery was prompt , returns experience is average as they do take ages to update their returns .
neutral	people taking calls on average most are not very helpful or knows what they are taking about .
neutral	i had a good and a really bad customer service online before .
neutral	on the whole , i would give them a 0 . 0 out of 0 .
neutral	they need to give better customer service .
neutral	i do like the take 0 payments which are great if you are short of cash to get something you need really badly .
neutral	and if you pay them within the stipulated time without interest is great .
neutral	i ordered a slimline_dishwasher and a beko tall freezer to have a reversible door , because a ) i '_ve had a stroke and have only one hand to use .
neutral	this was made known to you at the time , but before it was due to be delivered i received an_email_saying unless i put the old freezer outside ( over one step ) from my porch , then you wouldn_'_t deliver my new one .
neutral	as i couldn_'_t do it i had to get my son to drive one and half hours to me to do this for me ... then on delivery day , i was told the door had not been reversed and you had delivered it to the wrong_address and so i would have to go on waiting till you could .
neutral	it did arrive and i asked the delivery man to make_sure the adjustable legs were in order to stop any rocking when opening the door , this was promised , but not done .
neutral	as i said what do you rate your commitment to disabled clients as ?
neutral	poor , abysmal or don_'_t you care anyway
neutral	i ordered the brother max high_chair which arrived with a faulty table .
neutral	customer_services at pram_world were very helpful and sent a new table out the next_day , unfortunately this new table was also faulty - third time lucky they sent out a replacement , which i am happy to say is fine .
neutral	pram_world were friendly and helpful throughout , but i think they should do more to check these tables before sending them out as they know there has_been an ongoing problem with brother max .
neutral	last may i had my glasses repaired and you sent them to my old work address so i updated my details with a phone_call .
neutral	earlier this month i returned them again for repair and once completed you sent them to my old address again , then blamed me for not having completed the change of address section .
neutral	of course i didn_'_t think it necessary to fill that in as i had already told you .
neutral	fortunately a friend forwarded them to me and when they arrived , all 0 letters inside had the correct_address .
neutral	very sloppy .
neutral	good selection of holidays .
neutral	the bouquet that i wanted to order had free chocolates and a vase but when i went to proceed to order it would not allow me to check the delivery for tomorrow - very frustrating so i ordered a different bunch .
neutral	i have only tried the hache .
neutral	burgers so far and were a little disappointed at the lack of flavour but ok we have not tried anything_else yet
neutral	probably not the best media companies out there at the present time .
neutral	i ’ ve only just changed from sky and they seem a little_bit dated with their package compared to their competition .
neutral	i think if they were to offer a good price deal compared to other_companies they would do much_better .
neutral	they also need to look after their existing clients a lot more than they do .
neutral	i did not realize the stones were unwashed and thus spent the next hour washing them down little by little .
neutral	one of the bags were opened .
neutral	however , the speed of delivery was good and it suited the purpose in the end .
neutral	we booked villa yaiza in playa_blanca , lanzarote for 0_weeks expecting a much higher level of comfort than we got .
neutral	the villa was clean but very basic in what it had to offer .
neutral	internet was extremely poor and satellite_tv was also very poor .
neutral	okay for one week perhaps but not 0 .
neutral	towels were small and of poor quality , no bath_mats and no mirrors in two of the bedrooms .
neutral	there was a table_tennis_table as advertised but it was jammed in to a small space with no room to hit anything other than perhaps your elbows !
neutral	very disappointed and not value for money in our opinion
neutral	web_site and quote easy to use and obtain , delivery dates were to be honest a pain , i am away with work a lot and couldn_'_t specify date , just had to let them try , even_though i was out then re arrange delivery .
neutral	however they just left them on my front_door_step , which as i live on busy main_road , wasn_'_t ideal plus having to carry_heavy wet boxes in wasn_'_t a joy either .
neutral	dissapointed no follow_up to check i was happy with everything , bearing in mind this wasn_'_t a cheap purchase .
neutral	the delivery service & the communication that came with it were good .
neutral	however i was disappointed to see how the paper_bags had been packed ... there was nothing to hold the bags in a bundle & so where they had slipped apart , i was left with several bags ( about a dozen of the larger_size & about 00 of the smaller_size ), that were creased & had handles bent_over to the point of coming off .
neutral	this was particularly disappointing as i was buying them on behalf of demelza hospice ( care for children ) & an event we have coming - up next week .
neutral	obviously every_penny we spend comes out of the charity funds & so it is a shame when things arrive damaged .
neutral	bought two tickets to wwe for my 0 year_old_son which is on 00th_november .
neutral	received a phone_call today advising that the seats we have reserved have fallen through but they were able to offer alternatives .
neutral	we have paid over the top for these tickets as they are ringside and have been advised that all should be fine with these new seats .
neutral	as another date was released after we purchased these we can now buy direct from ticket_master cheaper but wouldn_'_t have a great seat .
neutral	unsure_whether to wait and see if these tickets are genuine or settle for a not very good seat but at_least my son would be there .
neutral	help !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	quite a lot of effort when i only received £ 0 . 00 for my old_mobile !
neutral	the only_thing was that i could not get full details of the actual lenses , if the are ok well_worth it
neutral	i just managed to recieve a 000 . 00 bill as i was using data outside the uk .
neutral	to access my emails .
neutral	i didn_'_t realise it would be so expensive , my husband is on o0 and was ofgfered a bundle .
neutral	it cost him about 00 pounds for the whole trip !
neutral	after taking a day off work to wait in for pram , i had to phone city_link only to be told that delivery had been rescheduled for next_day .
neutral	they did not phone me to inform_me of this !
neutral	the next_day came and it still did not arrive !
neutral	i had to drive to the depot at 0pm at night in icy conditions - along with my two year_old_son and the fact that i am 0_months pregnant too was not good !
neutral	no apology from city_link so i have made formal complaints to both precious_little_ones and city_link - would not use plo again only due to awful ' collect yourself late at night ' service !
neutral	have to the other aa , .
neutral	then my man get from the
neutral	reading , from the c - 000 in the camera ..
neutral	and we do not the aa , but we give to them best friends
neutral	so i will not to let from again ..
neutral	thanks too .
neutral	order process was very smooth - have ordered both my partners and my protein and supps from bodybuilding_warehouse for over a year now .
neutral	got my text to say when my delivery was - parcel was not delivered .
neutral	my parcel was delivered to longmoor road instead of longmoor drive - customer service were very helpful when i notified them it was originally missing and the owner of longmoor road delivered my parecel to my house ( she wasn_'_t best pleased ).
neutral	we had a different experience to our normal one on this occasion , where as we would normally be able to get there in plenty of time and when we did go through and enjoy a coffee before flying off to somewhere different or nice this time due to the check in queues and the security queues there was absolutely no time to spare as by the time we got through we were boarding .
neutral	we still arrived in plenty of time and nothing seemed different but there were just not enough people getting you through the system and when travelling with a little one it makes a long journey even longer .
neutral	so , unfortunately i can '_t write a proper review of the airport or it '_s facilities other than check in , security and the loo as it '_s all we had time for .
neutral	sorry !
neutral	easy to follow , but problems processing payment then link didnt work .
neutral	sorted next_day .
neutral	product is good ! but one of the product seems to be used before , because it was open .
neutral	achica offers some tempting items at good prices , often but it '_s website is still a bit_clunky , items take rather long to arrive and are almost always in enormous boxes when smaller ones would be so much_easier to deliver and dispose of .
neutral	i avoid this social_network .
neutral	tried to use it but it just don_'_t suit me .
neutral	set of drums were main christmas_present for my son , had a delivery date , made arrangements for my parents to take collection , but it never came , went through this a second time , by the third time i spoke to a senior_manager who in fairness ensured it got to me but i feel as if i hadn_'_t insisted on speaking to someone higher up than the initial girl on the phone it wouldn_'_t have come and it was only a few_days before christmas at this stage .
neutral	i did receive an_apology and a bit of compensation but could have done without the hassle .
neutral	you should send an_email_confirmation that the parcel has_been collected .
neutral	parcel been taken but no confirmation left .
neutral	besides you the only company that requires label and addess printing .
neutral	very slow service , and poor information as to why it was taking so long
neutral	the advert said they would ring or email the delivery date neither was recieved .
neutral	the delivery van was able to deliver on the third_attempt would it not have been better to ring and let us know a day and time_slot ?
neutral	we are very happy with the product and if we had of been here the first time the van called it would have been a quick delivery .
neutral	wasn_'_t hugely_impressed with item as i got it for a present and it was packaged in 0 plain_brown boxes which i had to open to find the order form .
neutral	wouldn_'_t order from the site again
neutral	products ok and well priced , but delivery quite slow and packaging all damaged hen received .
neutral	i love the products and the prices however my first order was over shadowed by poor delivery timings .
neutral	i had to wait for a month for my products to arrive .
neutral	hermes who were the courier managed to lose the packaged order on three_separate_occasions .
neutral	eventually the order was sent out by royal_mail express delivery and arrived within 00_hours .
neutral	hopefully this is a one off experience .
neutral	webtogs was a really good site , i received my order quite quickly .
neutral	i would definately recommend it .
neutral	i think it would have been helpful if you had told me the original flights i booked were not available and given me the option to proceed or cancel as the flights now booked are not exactly convenient .
neutral	was a bit surprised about how cheap it was to rent a car through this site but of course on arrival in spain it was either opt for full comprehensive insurance_cover or pay 000_euros deposit for 0rd_party .
neutral	also had to pay for a full_tank of petrol even_though we were only there 0 . 0_days and only used a quarter of a tank .
neutral	so what originally looked like costing us around £_00 cost us over_£_000 .
neutral	poor service , having received my new phone i took it into the shop and they put the new sim_card in , but it didn_'_t work .
neutral	then had to wait 0_days for another one i gave the shop the tools that came with the phone to remove the sim_card but didn_'_t get them back .
neutral	when i asked about transferring my no '_s they said it would cost £ 0 but afterwards i found out i could do it through i tunes !
neutral	then when i registered my new sim on the phone ( website wouldn_'_t work ) i was told i would receive a text but after 00_hours it hadn_'_t come so i had to phone again !
neutral	this time i was told it was registered but i had to switch it off and on again !
neutral	a good value budget starter stand , however due to size it is vulnerable in transit .
neutral	i purchased this as a christmas_present and when it arrived the box was crushed and the stand was slightly_bent - hence it rocked when erected with the key board on top .
neutral	i tried to force it back however the metal of the stand is strong and having none of it !
neutral	a book under 0 side has made it stand firm .
neutral	please_note i would have complained and asked for a replacement however this was a last_minute christmas_present so out of time .
neutral	the telephone_numbers to call on return , so you can have vehicle delivered to the airport are not answered .
neutral	i have a disability and have been left on a few occasions at the airport for up to 00_minutes trying to contact for delivery .
neutral	instructions on where to meet your car are also a little vague .
neutral	it means you have to watch the traffic entering the airport and wave to the driver to catch his / her eye when you have identified your vehicle .
neutral	when the phones are answered , the service is extremely good .
neutral	in future i will phone the agent direct as he provides a much_better and immediate service .
neutral	he also brings my car back washed and clean .
neutral	i have used surfdome before and found it excellent for swim , beach and ski stuff .
neutral	however , the website search_functions could be improved .
neutral	for example , i wanted a rash_vest for my 0 - year_old and more - or - less matching swim_shorts .
neutral	not a quick and easy job , as i had to trawl_through pages of vests , then go through the pages of shorts .
neutral	other than that whinge , it '_s a good service .
neutral	my experience of delivery and processing a return was good - all very speedy and no_problems .
neutral	i am disappointed that the roses are too open - they are already dying after just 0_days .
neutral	i would not order from you again as it has not been worth £_00 .
neutral	after many_years of happy buying i was very disappointed to learn after my last purchase that i could not return a perfume jolie madame becasue i had actually opened it to smell the fragrance !
neutral	it could quite well have been re - sellable but , on enquiry i was told bluntly that a return and refund was not possible .
neutral	i gave the perfume to the british heart foundation and decided to think_twice about ordering from cheapsmells again .
neutral	this is very unfortunate as i have enjoyed buying from cheapsmells for some years_now .
neutral	my advice to other prospective_buyers .. be sure you don_'_t want to return an item before buying .
neutral	i ordered two push - on tap shower sprays in chrome finish and they sent ones with white plastic finish .
neutral	not desperately important as they are only for washing the dog , and it was not worth my while sending them back , perhaps they suspected that .
neutral	so not a perfect experience .
neutral	the vacation was well put_together by the rickshaw_travel team .
neutral	the itinerary was difficult to understand and did not flow easily , but the vacation itself did for the most part .
neutral	the end of the holiday could have been better organized , going from koh_samui to koh phangan only to go back to koh_samui to fly out .
neutral	i enjoyed the variety of experience that rickshaw offered through their booking program , and wish only that i had the time to experience more of thailand .
neutral	the follow_up for a refund by rickshaw to a segment of our holiday that had to be cancelled by inclement_weather was slow at best , whether it was due to the thailand travel_agent or rickshaw themselves and for that i am very disappointed .
neutral	i have yet to get resolution to that , or even communication on that regard , and i have been trying for three_weeks to get some answers .
neutral	hi
neutral	loved the flowers but considering we paid the extra for a ' deluxe ' bouquet , disappointed with the size - dread to think how few there would have been if we '_d gone for the standard one - certainly didn_'_t look like the advertised picture !
neutral	thanks
neutral	it '_s great that the website has a search_function that allows you to eliminate certain ingredients , such as pork ; not so great when you can '_t trust it , and you end up with food you can '_t eat .
neutral	add to that a customer_services rep who was pleasant enough , but clearly not bothered that i had a dish i would never be able to eat , and giving no_indication he would look into it or pass on the feedback , i won_'_t be ordering again .
neutral	nothing wrong with finding the product wanted , ordering it , paying for it or receiving it - all worked quickly and smoothly , but the system of applying discounts is a bit opaque !
neutral	on other_sites i use a message comes up saying words to the effect of " spend another £ x to get free delivery / extra bonus points / 00_%_discount " or whatever .
neutral	with multivits you have to ' know '!
neutral	also there is this business of " anyone at home over 00 ?"
neutral	well my husband is 00 but only in your last mailing have i seen instructions on how to tell you this .
neutral	a bit late as i have already put in two orders !
neutral	the goods were packaged very well and arrived from england quickly .
neutral	the problen is that i bought some chillli pickle , the lid had come loose and the oil had leaked .
neutral	the pickle jar was empty of oil and so i will be unable to use it .
neutral	i am annoyed as all my food now smells vay strongly of pickle and i lost money .
neutral	if this had not happened the service would have been excellent .
neutral	i ordered some flowers for my daughter for her_birthday and received email_confirmation of safe delivery .
neutral	i then discovered , on speaking to my daughter later that day , that she had been out all day .
neutral	she had picked_up a card which had been put through her letterbox that rather unhelpfully said the flowers had been left at her own door number !
neutral	she called on neighbours both_sides but no luck .
neutral	eventually she spotted a rather nice bouquet in the window of a house three down from her and thought she would call on the off - chance .
neutral	fortunately her very honest neighbour confirmed that they were indeed meant for my daughter .
neutral	i appreciate that it was not the fault of the florist that the flowers could not be delivered but i feel_cheated that i had been told they were safely delivered when clearly they were not and if it was not possible to deliver to a next door neighbour surely it would be better to keep them and try to arrange a more appropriate delivery time ( even at extra_cost ) rather_than risk them being lost .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	the flowers however were gorgeous and i would order again but give more specific delivery instructions next time .
neutral	hello
neutral	your selection of toys / games / puzzles is absolutely great and looking through your catalogue i ordered about 0 items and would know that next year , i would probably be able to find the same amount again .
neutral	i like to order enough to get p_&_p free so this having lots of selection is great .
neutral	the only_thing i would say is that there was a mistake in your catalogue where under the wooden guitar puzzle , it had the piano code instead .
neutral	it seems a shame that this mistake was not proof_read and it is extremely rare to find errors like this in catalogues , a bit unprofessional .
neutral	finally , on ringing your help line to explain the error ( as i had wanted the guitar but received the piano instead due to the mistake ), the lady i spoke seemed a little rushed and stressed .
neutral	i was trying to explain my problem but as soon as she clicked on to the issue , she interrupted me so i couldn_'_t finish what i was saying .
neutral	this is bad manners and disappointing .
neutral	i have still not received the guitar and did have to email the other day to remind you and am hoping to receive it soon .
neutral	but to end on a positive , you have great products and i look_forward to receiving your 0000 christmas catalogue next year where i know i will find plenty of products my children will enjoy .
neutral	with best_wishes
neutral	mrs_j l rew
neutral	i was very pleased with the quick service , but i did tick that they would take a bit of time to answer the door .
neutral	the flowers were left_outside at the front_door .
neutral	the recipient noticed the van leaving and found the flowers at the front .
neutral	orange customer_services is decent .
neutral	you don_'_t have to wait forever to get through to a human and they are always very chirpy and helpful .
neutral	when i had to call for a replacement phone in the past , i found them to be quite rude , in terms of asking if i usually allowed a three year_old to put my belongings down the loo and suggested that i should have been supervising them better .
neutral	this was the only time i have ever felt quite angry with them but , as with most companies , if they are taking your money they are excellent , as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude !
neutral	they are better_than many providers ( i . e 0 ) but probably not the best out there , i think i stay with them out of habit , more than because i get a brilliant deal with my contract .
neutral	my friends are staggered that i pay over_£_00_pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn_'_t all that either ( which i '_m stuck with for 00 mths !
neutral	).
neutral	quick and easy process to order but delivery schedule takes far to long compared to other_suppliers .
neutral	the delivery for boohoo has_been great ( ordered twice ).
neutral	however the quality of the items is left to be desired .
neutral	they are quite cheap but the first item i ordered ( a white quilted_jacket ) had black dots randomly on it .
neutral	i never returned it because it seemed like hassle but now i never order clothes and warn_people if they are contemplating it .
neutral	i bought some shoes and they ' re good quality but again unfortunately had a few random marks .
neutral	this means i won_'_t be ordering items form here often .
neutral	with my most_recent order , i selected next_day delivery because i really needed it today , but it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	it wasn_'_t a problem with the courier either ; i checked the bp website and they said it still hadn_'_t dispatched more than 00_hours_later even_though it '_s supposed to be guaranteed same day dispatch .
neutral	so be warned ; you may have to wait longer for your order than you '_ve been told .
neutral	that said , the products are generally good value for money .
neutral	i just wish they would expand their range a bit .
neutral	some nitrite - free beef_jerky would definitely make me a customer for life :)
neutral	the website was quick and easy to use , the main_thing that let my experience with double0_tickets down was that the tickets did not arrive until very last_minute and i found myself on the phone to them various times having to try and trace where my tickets were to ensure they would arrive in time .
neutral	i found the customer service quite poor as the woman seemed vey unsure and gave_me false_information about when i would receive the tickets .
neutral	she also seemed very against the idea of changing the address to that on my hotel so that i would definitely have the tickets in time , as this may have caused more hassle for her .
neutral	saying this , i have finally got my tickets today in special delivery but any later then i would have been unable to go to the concert which i payed just under_£_000 for .
neutral	responding to your reply that i received ... from your team about immortelle ..... albeit it may be a cat deterrent plant but there are several varieties .
neutral	this ingredient is used in l ' occitanes divine cream ... the immortelle that grows wild in corsica .... a place i presume where there are no cats .. also are you aware that peppermint is a pest repellant .. used as a mice repellant ...
neutral	the website is easy to use .
neutral	the flowers were delivered when they said they would be .
neutral	my friend was out and instead of the flowers being left with a neighbor they were left on the doorstep in bad_weather .
neutral	in addition the florist did not place the card i had requested on the flowers so she did not know who had sent them .
neutral	this resulted_in confusion and worry .
neutral	my mother in law recieved the flowers , but they look nothing like the picture .
neutral	disapointed .
neutral	they should have been red_roses in it and there were none .
neutral	i have had before from you and they have been very good but sadly not this time
neutral	ordered dog rear car_seat protector .
neutral	the money went through but i did not receive a confirmation_email so was worried what had happened to my order .
neutral	the product did not arrive in time for first use , a short holiday in uk so we had to use a blanket on the rear_seat .
neutral	when the order finally arrived , on return from our break , we were happy with the product and packaging in which it arrived .
neutral	however , the failure to receive the product in time and confirmation_email of order , whilst the money had been taken from account , was disappointing .
neutral	impressively competitively_priced but i could not read the instructions as the print was so tiny and alas the " certificate " did not print out from teh e_- mail .
neutral	i asked a friend who is a whizz on computers and he redirected the e_- mail into word and then enlarged the print - but it was quite a worry initially .
neutral	i ordered gifts and stocking_fillers .
neutral	each arrived in a small individual box however once opened each item was placed in scrunched paper which doesn_'_t look neat at all .
neutral	certainly doesn_'_t have the feel of a new item i could have gifted a pre_- owned bracelet that way .
neutral	i browsed lenstore over a weekend when you were offering 00_%_off and had added items to my basked but in the end decided to not check out .
neutral	since i had logged on to my lenstore account , this must have triggered a process and a few hours_later i received an_email asking if free delivery would make more likely to purchase items from lenstore ( which it would ) with a voucher_code and link .
neutral	however , as soon as i clicked on the link , the 00_%_discount previously offered was gone and instead a free delivery was automatically_applied .
neutral	this alternative worked out to be more_expensive for my overall transaction - but there didnt seem to be a way for me to remove the free delivery and reapply the 00_%_discount !
neutral	i had to wait to the following work day , call your office and have it processed over the phone .
neutral	the free delivery model has not been thought through as in some cases it can make transactions even more_expensive !
neutral	or confusing !
neutral	ideally i would have liked both the 00_%_off and free delivery , these are two different_types of discounts and should be allowed simultaneously .
neutral	the service in the shop was pleasant and efficient .
neutral	i was happy to wait for my goods so opted for the free delivery option .
neutral	unfortunately told that deliveries to my area did not take place on the one day my husband could be at home .
neutral	no deliveries at weekends make it very difficult for those of us who work full time . i had to re - arrange my working hours to fit the delivery day .
neutral	when my goods did arrive the delivery drivers were very cheerful and explained what i should do if not happy .
neutral	fortunately i am very pleased with the price and quality of my table .
neutral	good idea for collections when you ' re not familiar with local courier firms and the job is outside your local area , but i was let_down by the first courier and had to re - post the job and make alternative_arrangements which was a bit stressful at the time .
neutral	a reply from oak_furniture_land , " mr dawson called the customer service number on the 00nd_january and informed my colleague that he was pushing a five year_old on the chair .
neutral	i can only surmise that this type of misuse has caused the damage ."
neutral	the call was actually on 00st_jan .
neutral	we bought the dining_set in july , we usually sit our 0 years old in and push him forward a little_bit for dinner , we have been doing this for 0_months on the same chair , there '_s no problem at all .
neutral	a few_days ago , we had to change him a different chair as his normal chair has some food dropped on , we put him in the different chair , push him forward as what we normally do , the bar at the back of the chair just snapped .
neutral	we got in touch with customer service , after one week , the above answer is what we got .
neutral	will never buy any thing from them any more .
neutral	we can not believe_how bad the service is ...
neutral	sample service excellent .
neutral	the fabric i consequently ordered was sent out in the wrong fabric .
neutral	took a phone_call and about 0 emails to sort it out - the colour i wanted was , by now , out of stock .
neutral	i was told the fabric would be delivered and the incorrect one collected .
neutral	neither when the wrong fabric was delivered , or the right one , was i sent an_email to tell me the order had been dispatched - pure_luck i was in each time .
neutral	courier wouldn_'_t take the wrong one .
neutral	so another phone_call and i was told it would be collected yesterday .
neutral	stayed in .
neutral	they came today !
neutral	yodel are terrible with delivery , as they won_'_t leave the box if your not in not even with a neighbour my poor cat had to wait nearly 0_weeks !
neutral	some of the message was left off the card , so the recipient was confused with who they were from !
neutral	easy to put up but the large width of the blind i got didn_'_t seem to work very well , 0 screws holding the whole blind in place makes it tricky when sliding the blind up and down it seems to come down ok but pushing it back up is a different_story it snagged quite a few_times pulling out of the side tracks and when these are going on windows in student_accommodation its a disaster waiting to happen maybe smaller blinds would work better .
neutral	i think i will stick with velux genuine blinds next time they are more_expensive but a lot sturdier .
neutral	i have finally received all of my order - several months after_placing it .
neutral	it arrived in dribs and drabs , meaning numerous days off work to receive it , which is far from ideal .
neutral	one item had to be returned twice due to damage , but glad to report it was 0rd time lucky and we finally have it all in one piece .
neutral	i love made '_s items , i found customer service lovely and helpful .
neutral	i hate their slow and piecemeal delivery .
neutral	i found the product easy to use and the effect not immediate i notice the pain in my ankle less pain
neutral	everything is ok
neutral	except oil split everywhere , have to clean other products which cover with fushi oil i ordered - i thought i shall get part compensation for that
neutral	sky didnt release the money into my account .
neutral	six_months later i called quidco and as it has_been so long they released the payment anyway after some coaxing !
neutral	well_done quidco !
neutral	was hoping for a wow_factor , but it didn_'_t happen .
neutral	i paid_extra for de - luxe but couldnt see what the extra was .
neutral	very expensive for not many flowers
neutral	the sales_team is terrific .
neutral	but .... although i was told to expect my delivery on thursday having waited in until about 0 it took two calls to customer_services to learn that there had been trouble at the northampton depot and my goods would not be delivered .
neutral	there was no news about possible deliveries before tuesday april 00nd .
neutral	however .
neutral	the bill arrived last saturday !
neutral	bought some toffee peanut_butter ( had to buy two because of the minimum order thing ) and got some protein_bread for free ( which is lovely by the way ).
neutral	£ 0 and a bit for a tub of peanut_butter is fairly expensive so i probably_won_'_t be ordering it again in a hurry , but the service and delivery is good .
neutral	shame about the minimum order price for chilled goods as i don_'_t want to spend close to £_00 on egg_whites , but nice website and good range of products .
neutral	products ordered on the net do not arrive as quickly as those ordered by telephone .
neutral	people taking orders by phone are in a terrific rush ... they seem to have forgotten their manners .
neutral	asking advice of a nutritionist i found i knew more than she did on a supplement .
neutral	i do not feel they are as careful of their product range and publications as they were under past management .
neutral	they have lost the ethos going back to green farm that made me happy to use them myself and recommend them to clients .
neutral	i ordered 0 separate items together and yet you delivered them separately .
neutral	what a waste of time and money .
neutral	i am in the process of evaluating these coffees
neutral	i sent my phones by freepost on the 0st of the month but the money did not reach my account until the 00th .
neutral	it is fine if you are not in need of the money quickly , otherwise i advise you send your phones by recorded delivery , even then it takes two to three_days for the money to be in your account .
neutral	in short ," good service but extremely slow ".
neutral	having never used this company before i was hesitant when placing an order for nearly_£_000 , however i rang through to ask a few questions prior to ordering and was confident i was dealing_with a reputable_company after i got off the phone .
neutral	what a shame the experience has left me very disappointed .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t rung myself to chase my order along the way i would not have had a clue what was happening .
neutral	communication was non_existent , a few_days after_placing the order i rang to be told i would receive it within a couple of days ... no ...
neutral	i then rang again when it hadn_'_t arrived to be told the same thing , only after the third chasing phone_call was i told it was actually being sent that afternoon , i received two_thirds of the order the following_day , that was a week after_placing the order .
neutral	the outstanding item was out of stock but i was told that stock was coming in that week by the 00th_march and it would be sent when they received it .
neutral	another chasing phone_call when it didn_'_t arrive i was told it was due in and would be sent ... a final call this week to sue , who actually had the courtesy to come_back to me , i discovered that my item was actually not due in till april as there was a problem with the supplier .
neutral	sue arranged for me to receive a similar item .
neutral	yes the prices are great and i am pleased with everything received now , but nearly 0_weeks having spent in the region of £_000 , with no communication at all was a little stressful .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use again due to lack of communication .
neutral	the extinguishers were fine but i ended_up having to be housebound for 0_days because tnt didn_'_t deliver or communicate a delivery time until nagged .
neutral	eventually got everything about 0_days after original order .
neutral	very inconvenient
neutral	i found it dissapointing that i could not get a sample on the internet before ordering .
neutral	when i phoned to find out about it i got told different reasons .
neutral	the first time they were going to send me a copy for free .
neutral	then the second time i phoned because via_e . mail they were unwilling to send me one , the person i spoke to was quite rude and told me a different_story to the first person i spoke to .
neutral	the only_reason i ordered from this website is because i can not find the same invitations anywhere_else but i wont_be using the website again .
neutral	i ordered some items which were at a competitive price but were poorly packaged .
neutral	the jiffy_bag had burst_open at the end and the goods arrived with a postman '_s rubber_band around them .
neutral	fortunately there was nothing of a sensitive nature !
neutral	also beware the expiry_dates on items .
neutral	two items expired within 0_months .
neutral	the products are probably cheaper because they have a short_shelf_life , there is nothing wrong with the product but be careful if you are stocking up on an item .
neutral	my children have been to camp beaumont for the last three years and have always loved their experience there .
neutral	my daughter has_been for the last 0 years and this was my sons second visit .
neutral	they both had a great time although my son did get very upset as there were 0 boys in particular in his dorm ( brothers ) who made everyone '_s life very difficult , whether it be hurting the boys , frightening them during the night , refusing to switch the lights off , pulling the bedcovers off them through the night and just being generally horrid .
neutral	my son was so excited_about going to camp beaumont as he had such a great time last_year , but i feel that this experience with these boys has really put him off going again next year .
neutral	both he and the other boys in his dorm complained to his coach / leader who gave numerous warnings to them but nothing else .
neutral	i am under the assumption that three warnings and you ' re asked to leave - these boys had far more warnings and nothing was done .
neutral	my son was in tears when i called one evening which really is so very out of character for him .
neutral	i even phoned to explain to the reception staff what was going on and was informed the boys would be dealt_with and moved out of the dorm - this wasn_'_t done and they continued to make the lives of the other boys in the dorm very miserable .
neutral	i '_m quite disappointed with how this was dealt_with and although i will be encouraging both of my children to attend camp again next summer - i don_'_t think that my son will want to go again :-(
neutral	m yparcel still_hasn_'_t arrived and i am concerned we will not get it for christmas .
neutral	very disappointing
neutral	received great communication i . e through email and text to say order received , flowers being sent etc but was very disappointed with the size of the bouquet !
neutral	if i had gone into morrisons could have got a bunch that size for £ 0 , yet i spent £_00 on a bunch which i thought would be slightly_larger !
neutral	won_'_t use again !
neutral	i have lost out on 00 pound , i bought this phone and because the signal wasn_'_t working i bought a new phone ( just thought i had brought the wrong phone for my simcard ) as i have just been informed by you the phone was stolen hence_why it did not work , i do agree with this as i would hate to have my phone stolen and would hope someone would hand it in , but i bought this phone for 00 pound of somebody so not just the person_who '_s phone it is but also i have lost out , would appreciate it if i was the person_who '_s phone it was and will be having very strong words with who sold me the phone !!!
neutral	but thankyou great service :)
neutral	argos is a useful company for low - priced items .
neutral	less expensive furniture is not brilliantly made but very adequate for the price .
neutral	however , the argos reservation system is a real nightmare , sometimes it shows an item as not available , then if you try again , it is available .
neutral	you get e_-_mails saying that the items are not in stock , then you try again and they are .
neutral	this system needs a thorough overhaul , it is very frustrating and , i am sure , must lead some people to give up completely .
neutral	i had to try four times to reserve only a few items , then still had two_separate reservation numbers as i couldn_'_t get all the items to show as available at the same time , despite the fact that when it came to it , they were all available !
neutral	i recently bought some things for my 00th_birthday_party , the goods came and were well_packed and what i had ordered , i have used partyrama before and had no_problems but on this occasion the helium i bought was not full and yes i do know how to use the containers as i have had them before with out any_issues .
neutral	there was only enough to fill 00 balloons so we had to run to the shop and buy more which added to the cost of things , another £_00 in total .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i have had goods in the past and had no_problems with this .
neutral	i spent nearly_£_000 and purchased two lanscapes albums , they are wonderful if not a bit too thin , but the order was lost and i had to chase it up and it didn_'_t come till about three_weeks after i had ordered it .
neutral	my clients were not very happy .
neutral	normally a good prompt service but was disappointed with the last delivery .
neutral	flowers arrived on time and i was kept_fully up to date with delivert etc , however for £_00 there wasn_'_t many flowers in the bunch !
neutral	i had upgraded ( for an extra £ 0 . 00 ) to a delux_bouquet so i would hate to see how small the standard bouquet '_s are .
neutral	everything ok except the length of time it takes to get the goods .
neutral	in times like this i expect the same response i get off ebay mostly either same day or next_day despatch .
neutral	with an e_- mail telling_me the goods are on their way .
neutral	i ordered the cloud_nine rollers , one was faulty .
neutral	they came 0_days_later , not within 00_hours .
neutral	it is not possible to contact the company via ' phone , only by e_- mail .
neutral	i reported the fault , received an_automated_reply acknowledging it , followed a couple of days_later by a curt note asking me which roller was faulty .
neutral	since then i received an update saying my order no .
neutral	is being investigated .
neutral	i cannot get worked up about one roller , but hardly feel there is anyone other than some poor office junior trying to act as a customer service provider .
neutral	i '_m sorry to say that my products still have not arrived 0_weeks after order and paying for 0 - 0 working day delivery .
neutral	i '_ve_used beauty_bay for a while and up until recently have had no_problems .
neutral	i '_m wondering_if they have new systems in place or new staff ?
neutral	i am glad i was familiar with this bath_seat ( melomine 00 ") as the instructions sent were for a different seat entirely .
neutral	i am also glad that i already had a non_slip bath_mat and wall fixed grab_rail by my bath , as i do not feel that i could have used the seat unaided otherwise .
neutral	as it is i am pleased i have regained my independence when showering .
neutral	i ordered some sandals , great product , well_packed .
neutral	the only_slight_criticism i have is that they were delivered about 0_days after i ordered them the web_site guarantees 0_days .
neutral	i assumed from date of order , but apparently this is not so .
neutral	a bit misleading i thought
neutral	after receiving the item really quickly , i was really disappointed to see that the item had a reduced price ticket on it , i am assuming that this was meant to go to an outlet shop and not somebody who had paid full price for the item .
neutral	i did contact the customer service team to discuss my issue along with emailing over images of the lower priced ticket , i was really disappointed that i had to chase superdry for a resolution , superdry did eventually call me back and offered the difference in price , however this has really left a back feeling .
neutral	in future i think i will just visit an outlet centre to get the cheaper price .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	the returns forms are brilliant and very self_explanatory to use .
neutral	my gripe is that i had to return the trainers due to a manufacturing_fault , i completed the form as directed with the codes indicating why i was requesting a replacement and sent them back , i was sent a replacement trainer in a larger_size which i did not request .
neutral	my request was for a replacement trainer !!
neutral	obvs in the same size !
neutral	!
neutral	loved the trainers and can '_t wait to wear them !!!
neutral	how long till they get here ?
neutral	?
neutral	anna
neutral	hat the hidden_costs , but still the cheapest !
neutral	very nice flowers but
neutral	not what i orded i specifically orded the heaven sent bunch as they had fressia in as this was for my parents 00th_wedding_anniversary and these were one of the flower iin
neutral	my mothers wedding bouquet and her personal favourites i was very disappointed when the flowers were nothing like the ones on your web_site they contained carnations and chrysanthemums and lilles and not a fressia in sight as you know from my accout i have placed two orders this week and to say i was very disappointed is an_understatement ........ karen
neutral	et_très_bon tarifs .
neutral	mais la prestation en a été autrement .
neutral	la voiture , louée via hertz , était dans_un état déplorable , sale et avec_des détritus a l ' arrière .
neutral	peu satisfaisant .
neutral	order placed paid_extra for delivery arrived a week_later and not the next_day as promised .
neutral	easy to use website etc , ordered a neck for a rug i already had , however received an_email the following_day saying it was out of stock .
neutral	refund was dealt_with quickly and efficiently but would have been better if the website was uptodate with available stock !
neutral	!
neutral	easy to use website with very competative_prices .
neutral	however , their delivery service let them down .
neutral	i selected a thursday for delivery which was several days in_advance .
neutral	it was convenient as i could be available all day .
neutral	it did not arrive .
neutral	when i contacted them the next_morning i was given the couriers number and told to ring them .
neutral	i did so and was dealt_with efficiently .
neutral	it was delivered the next_day .
neutral	they had no idea why my item was not delivered in the first place .
neutral	i really feel that fires - cookers should have followed this up on my behalf and should have been aware that the delivery had not been completed .
neutral	if i had taken a day off work to take delivery i would have been more than a bit put out !
neutral	delivery aside i would recommend to a friend .
neutral	the item is perfect and very well priced .
neutral	the item itself was very good value for money .
neutral	however we were messed about with the delivery time .
neutral	it was supposed to arrive between 0 - 0 on monday .
neutral	i stayed in all day and when it didn_'_t arrive i phoned the company who told me it could arrive up to 0pm .
neutral	i didn_'_t so i called the company again the next_morning .
neutral	the lady i spoke with was very polite and told me it had been put on the wrong van but would call me back which she did and told me it would arrive that day .
neutral	it didn_'_t so i called again that night and spoke to another nice lady_who then said the van had a puncture but it would be upgraded to delivery before 0 . 00 the next_morning .
neutral	it did arrive at 0 . 00 and despite the delivery problems we are pleased with it .
neutral	not fittede it yet but it looks good quality .
neutral	i did camebridge diet but found having to see a counsellor a pain .
neutral	ordered exante - most of the soups are fine but the chocolate shake smells and tastes of wet dog .
neutral	shame .
neutral	ordered the correct_size as per size_chart sheet on the website .
neutral	i . e to measure it by the knee however does not take into account your leg size above the knee cap .
neutral	i brought this knee stabiliser for skiing , it was a struggle to pull the support on .
neutral	i could not pull it onto my thigh .
neutral	therefore i had to order the next size up .
neutral	which is nothing like the size of my knee .
neutral	when i eventually got through the physioroom , i could not exchange the item there and then , i had to return the item first , wait for a refund then re order it again .
neutral	very time_consuming , plus you have to pay the return fee .
neutral	so if your a lady with normal lady curvy legs be careful what size you order .
neutral	up size it if you can .
neutral	the assistant i spoke to on the phone was very helpful and set me an online account up with my order in the shopping_basket to check and confirm .
neutral	delivery came when i asked but the order was wrong .
neutral	not everything was built it that i had asked for and was on my order summary .
neutral	very frustrating having make phone_calls to sort the problem and then wait for a part to be sent out .
neutral	the down_side of using this company was the fact that on the day when i was expecting to receive my delivery , i was informed that it would not be delivered until the following_day .
neutral	however , following this , the experience was very positive as the delivery was within the time_slot which i had been given and the item was at a very reasonable_price in comparison to other_retailers .
neutral	i would definitely use them again .
neutral	we ordered ind pallet cvr hous000 and it said 0 / pk at price £ 0 . 00 so we assumed price per pack .
neutral	so we ordered 00 ( packs ), but when delivered we received only 00 covers ( 0 packs ).
neutral	order system not clear .
neutral	i ordered some flowers a romantic gesture for my other half to cheer_her up .
neutral	the flowers i ordered were stunning .
neutral	i also received the vase which i ordered and it complimented the flowers perfectly .
neutral	unfortunately the ballon i ordered to say i love you had been replaced with a totally_inappropriate happy birthday_balloon .
neutral	i was extremely disappointed and contacted serenatra straight_away and am still_waiting on a reply .
neutral	needless to say they will not be my first choice of florist for future_purchases .
neutral	never any_problems
neutral	ordered two bags of dog_food bannered " buy two bags and save £_00 . 00 " when i queried this because full price was charged i was told this referred to the retail price that i may otherwise pay in a shop .
neutral	this is not what the web_site says and is a matter for trading_standards to now sort_out .
neutral	i really liked the variety of different food items listed that are difficult to find in the supermarket .
neutral	only problem is they do not stock them but i think have access to other specialist shops ?
neutral	disappointed that when i ordered , what they said on the website was available , i was told had to wait to get one item .
neutral	felt that was a bit of a con .
neutral	also took a bit of time to arrive as they use couriers instead of postal service , which would have been quicker .
neutral	finally tried_calling them at weekend but no one picked_up ?
neutral	but if you really want unusual items its a good site to use .
neutral	i ordered boots which were lovely but did not quite fit .
neutral	i was surprised to find that , in order to return the items , i woudl need to send them to sweden at my own_expense .
neutral	not ideal !
neutral	also , i could not exchange my goods .
neutral	i could only return them and then order something new .
neutral	this does not seem to be a good system and does not pursuade me to shop online with ecco again but i will shop in store , where the staff were helpful and friendly when i returned the item there .
neutral	( westfield branch )
neutral	sadly the owner , who i have emailed twice_now , still_hasn_'_t replied :-(
neutral	this is the second time i '_ve purchased a roller_blind from ' blinds 0 go ', the first one was such a brilliant fit even the fittings fit into the old screw_holes ; this time however , the blind and the fittings together were too wide for the window and my husband had to recite them above the window , leaving holes to be filled an painted .
neutral	having said that the blind is lovely
neutral	i ordered on line having spotted the website whilst looking for the number of a local_florist .
neutral	i chose a strawberry_sundae bouquet and the ordering and payment process was very easy and efficient .
neutral	i also received confirmation emails and texts which very reassuring .
neutral	however , when i called my friend on her_birthday , i was disappointed to find that the flowers were received in a box and not the bouquet shown on the website .
neutral	my comments are currently being reviewed by serenata .
neutral	the ordering process was easy and the information on the website was clear & accurate .
neutral	email_notifications were helpful and i was clear on when delivery was going to be - i did opt to pay for named day delivery .
neutral	i don_'_t agree with the additional_charges for removing packaging which i think should be a standard offering and £_00 to move item to another room is cheeky .
neutral	compared to other_retailers i think these details should be part of the company '_s focus on customer service .
neutral	i would definitely order again .
neutral	i ordered cardboard_cutout of harry from one direction for my niece .
neutral	unfortunately it came in a large padded_envelope ( which was very thin ); however , the postman folded it through the middle with the result that the figure had a bend straight across the face , which was disappointing for my niece .
neutral	i telephoned and the company have agreed to send out another one , so fingers_crossed it doesn_'_t come squashed .
neutral	it would have been better if it had a do not bend sticker on envelope .
neutral	i ordered 0sets of personalised playing cards from jessops , and then a further set .
neutral	although i received an e . mail 0_weeks_ago , i have not yet received the cards .
neutral	however , i called them 0_days ago and the girl was as helpful as she could be .
neutral	she has re - ordered the cards , and is trying her best to get them to me for xmas .
neutral	they can '_t do more than that .
neutral	just hope they do arrive in time !
neutral	small plastic part was 0th of price of whole fridge .
neutral	quick service though and arrived_safely .
neutral	some of the palest foundations were still very orange and muddy looking
neutral	basically a good service just a shame the card i had requested wasn_'_t delivered with the flowers
neutral	we ordered the " pink lady " bouquet to cheer a friend up after_seeing it on your site .
neutral	when the flowers were delivered , they weren_'_t really as per the picture on the website , and looked more like something we could have picked_up from a supermarket for half the price !
neutral	although i had no_problems with both my orders , i would have liked to have am email_confirmation when my order was received and another when it was dispatched .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive any email_confirmation although the goods were received quickly .
neutral	i have been very impressed by travel_nation especially in the preparation of my 0 - month trip through south_america .
neutral	heather was extremely_helpful and found some very good flights and offered what i found to be a very good price for a package of 00 flights including transatlantic flights ...
neutral	i had contacted another travel_agent and travel_nation was the best in terms of flight convenience and price .
neutral	of course i had been warned that the formula i had was not flexible so i knew what to expect .
neutral	the day i needed to change flights , it actually ended_up being less expensive to just not show up at the airport and book new flights by myself , rather_than requesting travel_nation to change them .
neutral	i had been warned that changes could be very expensive with the type of ticket so that was no big surprise .
neutral	i would just recommend in general to be aware of what tickets you are buying and carefully read all the small lines in the terms and conditions !
neutral	the main annoyance was that one of my flight was canceled by the airline and travel_nation automatically refunded the money on the credit_card i had used to pay the ticket - but that i had canceled since then .
neutral	when i realized it , it was too late .
neutral	it has_been 0_months now and this kafkaian situation still_hasn_'_t been solved with my bank saying they never received the money because the credit_card was canceled and travel_nation saying that they already processed the refund .
neutral	i have no way of telling who is at fault .
neutral	i have to admit that travel_nation customer service has_been very polite and professional in responding to all my emails so far so i can '_t complain_about that ... however my money is gone and they tell me i am not going to recover it !
neutral	it might be only 000_pounds but still annoying .
neutral	so it had all started nice but between the additional flights i had to buy , the one that was canceled and the messed_up refund story , it ended_up not being as pleasant an experience as i expected .
neutral	ironically travel_nation staff still deserve to be complimented on their communication_skills since they managed to prevent me from losing all my patience for so long .
neutral	every time i make an order i '_m told i have a discount .
neutral	but have to phone to confirm this it never goes though automatic .
neutral	takes so much more time to then made my order .
neutral	i think i am a good customer who orders regularly and have done so for about 0 years would be nice i could do everything on line and not take so much time on the phone .
neutral	reasonable value
neutral	product described well .
neutral	product took ~ 00days to arrive , had to phone up to find out where order was .
neutral	difficult to get_hold of customer service .
neutral	had to leave voicemail and wait call to be returned .
neutral	once sunglasses promised to be delivered the next_day , they did arrive .
neutral	pleasant customer service team .
neutral	i bought two_pairs of glasses .
neutral	the black ones were ok but the tortoiseshell ones were not the same prescription .
neutral	my name was spelt wrong on the cheque so had to he sent back therefore delaying cashing of the cheque
neutral	ordering is straight_forward and problem free .
neutral	however , this is the second time i have used company and there appears to be a problem with courier .
neutral	on both_occasions the recipient reported being at home during the day but not aware of delivery .
neutral	the delivery instructions , i assumed , were in case the recipient was not at home but it would appear that the courier is following delivery instructions without first knocking on door of delivery address to check if recipient is at home .
neutral	it was easy to buy my bracelet but can '_t actually feel any benefit after wearing it for a few_weeks .
neutral	however it is attractive so money not entirely wasted .
neutral	i tired to fill in my quote online but had difficulty_getting all my medication on there so i decided to call .
neutral	i called three_times and waited for over 00_minutes so left messages for someone to call me back of which no one did .
neutral	i called again and after about 00_minutes got through to a lady_who was very nice but i don_'_t think she quite understood that i needed to add all my medication to the quote i '_d been given .
neutral	she gave_me a quote but i wanted to look through it all first so she emailed it to be right away .
neutral	i was wary as it was very cheap so i called again a few_days_later and asked to restart the quote .
neutral	this time i was asked many more questions and my medication was logged correctly , not just in my notes section .
neutral	the quote came out more_expensive however still very reasonable and affordable for cystic fibrosis that has required iv antibiotic treatment in the last 00 weeks and cfr diabetes .
neutral	so my advice is persevere with waiting to speak to someone and get a quote over the phone if your medical_history is complex and colourful !
neutral	it is worth it in the end .
neutral	price and internet service was as expected .
neutral	service from local provider was or as no contact on day of fitting and i has to chase leaving voice mails etc several_times .
neutral	when arrived good service .
neutral	shame contact with the fitter let you down .
neutral	easy to use website .
neutral	prompt receipt if posting bag with instructions .
neutral	however disappointed as although said gave_me 00_quid for my blackberry_curve it was more like 00 after i had paid for postage back with security of signed for .
neutral	not very happy - the day after i received my order prices were reduced by 00_%
neutral	easy website to use , but not sure about delivery yet as i have on , y just started_using them
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i am having to return tge diary i ordered from you as the skin of thecover has bee cut too small leaving unseemly gaps on the corners which i know will fray .
neutral	i am really hoping that this article is a one off mistske as i am very disappinted to have to return it .
neutral	hoever i was assured by your customer serbices that every article is quality checked , ehich has depressed me as i would not have expected that sort of workmanship to have been acceptable to you in the past .
neutral	i am still hoping sonplease let_me kmow when you receive my return at the end of the week
neutral	i would say the quality was brilliant but for the price it wasn_'_t bad ..
neutral	we saw a lovely oak tv corner_unit on the cotswold website ( lyon petite ).
neutral	it said it was out of stock but more were on the way .
neutral	i clicked on " email when available " and got what is clearly a standard automated_reply telling_me they have more of this popular item on order .
neutral	we '_d already placed an order for the matching telephone table .
neutral	a few_days_later i got an_email to say " this item is now discontinued ".
neutral	so much for them having more on order .
neutral	i did contact cotswold to explain that the wording of their auto_reply needs amending as it is misleading .
neutral	this was acknowledged and an_apology given .
neutral	our lamp_table order was fulfilled and looks great .
neutral	thankfully it '_s in another room so not needed to match with the tv corner_unit .
neutral	luckily we found the same tv_unit on another website under a different name , which we now have and it too looks great .
neutral	i would shop again with cotswold , but only when an item is actually in stock .
neutral	good prices
neutral	would have rather been able to have free shipping
neutral	i found the watch my hubby had seen advertised on tv very easily on fcw website .
neutral	the price was reduced making it great value .
neutral	the bracelet fitting service was very useful .
neutral	i got regular email_updates from the moment my order was placed .
neutral	i was told as soon as my order was despatched .
neutral	i was very impressed that this was on the next_day !
neutral	issues only began when the parcel courier used couldn_'_t deliver on a saturday ( even if i paid_extra ) or after 0pm ( i get home from work around 0 : 00 !).
neutral	i had to collect it from their depot .
neutral	this probably_wouldn_'_t have been a bother for someone_who drives .
neutral	but i don_'_t .
neutral	i obviously couldn_'_t ask my hubby to take me because it '_s his surprise pressie !
neutral	i work in the city_centre so i had to take a taxi across the city to collect the watch and then all the way back across the city and then out in the opposite_direction to my home !
neutral	deducting the taxi_fare from the saving i had made on the watch price made it seem less of a bargain .
neutral	i have fed this back to fcw and while ever they use apc i '_ll just buy from the high_street .
neutral	i '_m_sure it wasn_'_t your fault that the boots took quite so long to arrive but i did have to phone four times and was always told they would be with me later that week which they never were .
neutral	it hasn_'_t put me off recommending you but would suggest that people don_'_t try to buy obscure sizes like i did !
neutral	items were of a very poor quality would not wear them , couldn_'_t wear them they wore practically see - through .
neutral	quick delivery but arrived in torn broken packaging which looked as though someone had tried to open it and it was wet and dirty . if the quilt had not been in a polythene_bag it would have ruined
neutral	i '_ve_used approved food a few_times because of their fabulous bargains , although i must_say their postage_charges do put me off at times !
neutral	the reason i started_using approved food was because of my terrible financial_situation , so when i see how much i '_m supposed to be spending in postage_charges it really puts me off !
neutral	also they emailed me to say they would be putting an ingredients_list on their website but never did , which makes me frustrated / angry !
neutral	the adviser was friendly but it was a bit difficult trying to sort_out a cot and highchair for jacob ( my grandson ).
neutral	was told it was on availability but we cant do without it .
neutral	he cant sleep on the floor hes only 0 .
neutral	didnt get confirmation of highchair not holding my breath that we get it .
neutral	otherwise pretty friendly but adviser kept having to go back to hotel to confirm things which took rather a long time .
neutral	heather
neutral	ordering , supply and delivery all great , couldn_'_t be better .
neutral	opened the package to find one triple_pack leaking ink all through package .
neutral	now not so sure if i should use any of them !
neutral	:-(
neutral	neutral .
neutral	website said item was in stock , let_me purchase but then item was not in stock so left disappointed .
neutral	but quick refund so thanks for that
neutral	it was a good , fast booking in , and even moved onto earlier time as they were running_late , due to bad_weather .
neutral	but the meal was dreadful , no mushy peas , they had all gone , and the fish tasted like cooked cardboard !.
neutral	as this was the second bad food experience we won_'_t ever be eating on board again .
neutral	your form to review bluechip holidays had already filled in username with my e_- mail address .
neutral	i didn_'_t realise my e_- mail address would be displayed .
neutral	please take my email adddress off my feedback and delete my username as my e_- mail address
neutral	my order was fulfilled with the wrong_size so i asked for a different pair - the wrong_size was sent the second time - third time they were correct_size - but it took nearly 0_weeks !
neutral	canvases quality is not great and paint is often out of stock taking a long time to get orders , great value if you are not concerned with quality
neutral	the order was sent to the wrong_address , the food was great value but delivered in white sacks so no idea is was what i ordered !
neutral	can '_t comment ...... goods have yet to arrive !!
neutral	!
neutral	finally received my order after 00 working_days .
neutral	happy .
neutral	apologies for the previous comments . make correction that the delivery may take up to 0 month or more to make people aware . i bought different argain oil , but will be keeping this from wowcher us well .
neutral	the delivery and packaging was all brilliant .
neutral	just a pity i found it on ribble too late .
neutral	i couldn_'_t work out how to pick multiple photos so had to do all individually which took a long time .
neutral	was very frustrated after i had picked 00 and they all disappeared and i had to start again .
neutral	then when i got to 000 i had to upload them , which took_ages .
neutral	then i couldn_'_t get back to the page which allowed me to choose some more .
neutral	so the offer for up to 000 photos for the one price was not as good as it should have been because i only got just over 000 .
neutral	i was delighted to find an easy - to - heat ( and eat ) product that was free from common allergens , however i was a little disappointed with the taste .
neutral	the lamb dish was nice but very similar to a tinned curry from marks &_spencer .
neutral	the pork and madeira dish was pleasant enough but my daughter didn_'_t like it at all .
neutral	it could have used a little more flavour , i added quite a lot of salt to make it taste better .
neutral	obviously ilumi have to cater to all palates but personally i would have preferred a stronger taste ( perhaps more herbs )?
neutral	i recently_purchased a dark_green hoodie online .
neutral	the product arrived without a zip which was very frustrating especially as it wasn_'_t cheap !
neutral	i am put off ordering online again as it '_s a real inconvience to have to send items back if faulty , especially when you need them by a certain_date ( birthday )!
neutral	also , as it was such an obvious fault i '_m annoyed that it was missed and still sent to me .
neutral	the breakfasts were lovely and the staff we met were pleasant .
neutral	the room was clean .
neutral	however we booked a family room which said it had a double and two singles and when we arrived it had one z - bed as the single and no other bed available so one of us slept on the quilts and pillows on the floor .
neutral	a single_bed turned_up for the second night .
neutral	the room was over the bar and there was a party until_0pm in the morning with the clearing up noise ceasing by 0pm .
neutral	the noise from the extractor fans were loud all night and the curtain_rail fell on top of me when i drew the curtains in the morning .
neutral	a man was sent to fix in within half hour of reporting it .
neutral	so not the best place for our first ever visit to scotland !
neutral	even_though you offer the best prices compared to other_websites , you do not seem to acknowledge your frequent customers .
neutral	l have been shopping on this website over a year , not even once have l been sent a discount on my shopping , which l find very strange .
neutral	flowers where a gift to my nan for her_birthday and she loved them along with the little cake we included however they where delivered a day earlier_than requested when we kne she would not be in so nan had to go and collect them herself which wasn_'_t great .
neutral	we were given a lane number which over full and resulted_in us being halfway across the road so that the lorries were very close to the rear of our car .
neutral	this also happened in the next lane and when we queried it with an official we were told that it happens all the time and that eventually my ferry_link would be told by the port authority that they must do something about it .
neutral	we had fish & chips and a cold drink for 0 people at 00 . 00 am and it cost £_00 . 00 and was disgusting .
neutral	the fish was obviously cooked on the crossing before ours and kept warm .
neutral	therefore it was like eating a cork place mat .
neutral	the chips were no better !
neutral	this has put us off from travelling with you again !
neutral	i found both wines i was looking for in the sane place that was hard to find else where .
neutral	the rating would have been higher if the delivery company didn_'_t mess me around .
neutral	shame really .
neutral	handy for results , but they could make it easier to find sign in .
neutral	although my christmas box was delivered on time , the ricipients of the box received an_email from kiren_parcelhero copied to me the day after it had been collected from me asking them to call their local office to pay duty and tax .
neutral	i knew the box could not possibly have arrived the day after it had been picked_up from me .
neutral	i emailed the recipients in canada to tell them not to pay anything until i investigated .
neutral	i emailed kiren_parcelhero to ask what was going on , but received no answer .
neutral	although the box was delivered on time , this did give me some cause for concern .
neutral	i thought the website experience was fantastic and was able to select photos and design easily .
neutral	the invites were brilliant but with 00 invites that i ordered i got 00 envelopes which really let the service down as i then had to try and find other envelopes at short_notice :(
neutral	just love my beautiful oak lounge unit , can '_t stop looking at it , the quality is superb , delivered in one week .
neutral	now i want to buy a table and chairs to match .
neutral	my only_criticism is that the unit came in two pieces and very well_packed in big boxes and plenty of packing .
neutral	it was impossible for me to lift the top unit onto the base_unit , and so much packing to dispose of .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for a very kind neighbour who put it together for me , and a call to my daughter who very kindly took all the packing to the tip for me ., i would have been in a real fix
neutral	i would willingly pay to have it delivered and put_together , and the masses of packing taken_away , as i '_m_sure many other ladies on their own would .
neutral	ordered epiphone ukulele and belcat 00w slim amp on monday and tracked until thursday when they said that they had tried to deliver but they hadn_'_t so after several phone_calls to yodel they managed to phone their driver who was in next village so arranged to meet at coop to pick_up package ( never really wanted to be a courier ) his excuse was that his sat_nav sent him wrong .. any way product is good although it came without pick guard and amp was not slim one as ordered ( but not worried_about this ...) i would recommend this firm as i think courier was at fault ..
neutral	i rang to advise i would be there for 0 . 00 am - was told we are expecting you at 0 - so i said ok - i had to make 0 further calls to check where they were as was cautioned 0 times by the warden and moved twice .
neutral	they finally arrived at 0 . 00 am
neutral	other than that the drop back was pucntual
neutral	delivery was quick but inside packaging was not protective enough and two of the screw plastic lids were broken , i assume from the trip ...
neutral	villa was tired and in need of attention .
neutral	found fleas on our second week .
neutral	wouldn_'_t book with them again .
neutral	first , what i liked : excellent correspondence from westin_gourmet ( regular_updates on my order via_email and text_message ), quick responses to a query i had and a genuine willingness to help , and the order arrived on schedule .
neutral	what i didn_'_t like : i didn_'_t really enjoy the meat i ordered .
neutral	but then again , the products i ordered ( gluten - free burgers and sausages ) were processed meat products , so for all i know , their ' pure ' meat products , steaks etc .
neutral	might be fantastic .
neutral	i don_'_t think i '_ll order again , but if you ' re into meat , by all means try them and decide for yourself .
neutral	when i first placed my order with u i realised i had mistakenly_ordered the wrong_size stockings , i emailed direct from the site to see if this could be rectified .
neutral	i was very pleased to receive a reply from nicola hackett who advised of an_alternative product , i thought this was a great personal service and took nicolas advice .
neutral	when my order arrived in a very speedy manor i was again thrilled with your service .
neutral	until i realised i had been sent the wrong_size which i ordered in error .
neutral	apart_from that i find your company very professional and customer friendly , hope to order again soon .
neutral	speedy service , however i had to pay the £ 0 . 00 postage plus an admin_fee of £ 0 . 00 to the post_office , as no postage had been put on the envelope .
neutral	also my time and petrol to go and collect it .
neutral	my bank stopped my payment as i ' don_'_t usually order on line '!!
neutral	when i rang to query i received a most_unhelpful , disinterested response .
neutral	sufficient to put me off re - ordering .
neutral	the flowers were great and the delivery very prompt and efficient .
neutral	plus the messages confirming the delivery status were extremely_helpful .
neutral	but the ordering process was a nightmare as i got thrown off the pages so many_times and had to re - enter the same information time and time again .
neutral	bought the epc through rentify so expected it would be sent to me via_email from themt or uploaded to ad by rentify but instead i had to do a search for the subcontractor who carried_out the epc online myself .
neutral	when finally uploading the epc my ad was suppose to go active soon but i had to chase them up as it seems they forgot causing delay in finding tenants .
neutral	then when i did find a tensnt via gumtree i asked for more info on the credit check service they offer & again slow response .
neutral	in the end it was too latte so used an_alternative .
neutral	also only having monday - friday limited hours is a big negative .
neutral	delivery address 00 sheepcot drive watford herts wd000dz email not going to you regards kathy
neutral	i ordered 0 items on a monday_evening and was expecting them to arrive that week .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive my items until the following thursday !
neutral	when i phoned to chase_up my order i was told that my order " probably " wasn_'_t sent out on time due to an item not being in stock but the lady i spoke to wasn_'_t sure .
neutral	i hadn_'_t had any emails to inform_me of this so i was quite worried as to where my order was .
neutral	i was highly_recommended animed through a friend who hadn_'_t had any_problems ordering in the past but unfortunately animed didn_'_t live up to my expectations .
neutral	i wasn_'_t sent an_apology for the late order or lack of communication .
neutral	however , i will order from animed again as the prices are fantastic .
neutral	i just hope for a better service next time .
neutral	prices are compatible wiv other_companies and took more dvds / cds than other_companies .
neutral	good cust service informed every_step if the way .
neutral	wud use again .
neutral	parcel dropped at collection_point so don_'_t have to wait in no_probs start to finish
neutral	flowers arrived promptly so service and advice of delivery excellent .
neutral	recipient probably a little disappointed - lot of greenery but now that the flowers have opened fully finds the colour very striking .
neutral	had expected the record to be packaged with stiffeners as juno used to always do this in the past .
neutral	sent me the wrong_colour shoes !
neutral	couldn_'_t be bothered to send them back !
neutral	they were the right size , which is a bonus !
neutral	we had an excellent driver and polite and knowledgable courier at the outset of our bus_tour .
neutral	then we hopped off to have something to eat at henry '_s bar near green park .
neutral	on re - boarding the bus a female driver and young_girl courier got on .
neutral	to say that the driver was rude and unhelpful to passengers is putting it mildly .
neutral	she denied passengers boarding saying she was driving the last bus and wasn_'_t going where they wanted to alight without offering them any advice , or alternative options .
neutral	she then collided with another bus ( whilst shouting and gesticulating at some pedestrians who happened to step off the pavement ) and then blamed the other driver .
neutral	she shouted that he had hit her bus and should stop or she '_d call the police and generally made a huge commotion .
neutral	the young courier was obviously embarrassed and came around the bus apologising to all the passengers .
neutral	after an_absolute debacle of a journey we decided to alight the bus a few stops early and walk to our intended destination .
neutral	i have to say this drivers behaviour appeared to be an exception , all the other bigbustours staff we came_across were helpful and courteous and we really enjoyed the majority of the tour .
neutral	i would have awarded 0_stars , but for the unprofessionalism of this driver .
neutral	this was not the same as photo on website so not 000_% happy .
neutral	but postage was good timescale hence score .

neutral	because of my illnesses in my bones stomach and other parts were i have crones disease and colitis i have no idea if the bimuno is working or not .
neutral	i have had 0 years worth including this consignment but i am still unsure if bimuno has helped .
neutral	as i have had to retire on ill_health 0 years_ago i find that the payment every 0_months is becoming harder to find .
neutral	i have been told that there are sometimes coupons but i have never seen any .
neutral	i am sorry if this is not the review you are looking for and bimuno has not caused any ill_health so i may carry on taking the powder .
neutral	i have wondered_if i should take 0 a day to see if it helps what do you think
neutral	yours_faithfully

neutral	delivery is much_faster_than it used to be
neutral	having had problems with two stolen / lost coats , my order eventually arrived 0_weeks after original order .
neutral	i am very pleased with the product , this is my second coat and they are very well made , i love the raspberry colour .
neutral	i will use the company again .
neutral	the cookware was despatched very quickly on receipt of my order .
neutral	however , i had requested that it would not be delivered on either of two particular dates , and the pan was delivered on the first of those two dates .
neutral	it was fortunate that we had a member of the family staying with us to take delivery of the parcel .
neutral	so the service was not satisfactory in this respect .
neutral	i found a great deal for a laptop on this site , went back 00_hours_later and it was still there but said out of stock .
neutral	now it '_s disappeared and the price has_gone back to the original .
neutral	i went into the local shop when the deal was online but they had the laptop in but not on the same deal !!
neutral	:-( missed out on that one !
neutral	the bed its self was great , good value for your money . when the bed was delivered to our surprise there was no bolts !
neutral	or instructions ! we then waited 0 0r 0_days for these after phoning . the instructions were very poor quality and it was hard to make the pictures out .
neutral	for those reasons i would be a bit_weary of ordering form the site again or at_least large pieces .
neutral	the hotel ( travelodge ) was shabby , uncomfortable beds and unclean room .
neutral	when we arrive 0 adults in one room had been booked which is not allowed ( 0 adults max ) so none of us were allowed to check in .
neutral	however chillisauce sorted it immediately .
neutral	the comedians at the comedy_club on friday and the service good , but the food ( burger and chips ) dreadful , think cardboard cold burgers and you would be there .
neutral	butlers in the buff were very good , i would consider hiring them for an event .
neutral	saturday '_s tapas was very good but we could of arranged saturday better on our own .
neutral	transport is not included in the cost so the cost of taxis everywhere added to the cost of the weekend .
neutral	the bag was beautiful but i had bought it for a gift and was hugely_disappointed that it wasn_'_t delivered in one of your usual boxes but in a carrier_bag instead .
neutral	by the time it had arrived , the carrier_bag was crumpled and even ripped .
neutral	after_spending £_000 , i think it deserved to be wrapped better .
neutral	it '_s the first time i have ever received something from your website that was not beautifully_wrapped .
neutral	i do hope it '_s not the way you will be sending purchases in the future .
neutral	i enjoy facebook but don_'_t understand many things that go on such as people wanted me to be added to ' birthdays ' etc .
neutral	i don_'_t think it is very self_explanatory at all when you want to get some help .
neutral	it wasn_'_t easy to decide which set of weights i was using .
neutral	does it start with kilos or pounds and ounces ?
neutral	i had to get a magnifying_glass out to read the switches .
neutral	i needed 0 red rugs so decided to order my smallest_size first to ensure i was happy with them .
neutral	the first rug arrived and i was happy enough with it so decided then to order the larger_size - which at £_00 . 00 was priced quite a bit higher than the ones in my local shop - although they didnt stock the colour i wanted .
neutral	when the second rug arrived it was very badly packed and when i opened it to lay it down i noticed that it had a pluck in it through which you could clearly see the white backing of the rug .
neutral	the rug was also wrinkled so very badly from the way it was packaged that even now after being flat on my floor for 0 week the wrinkles are still very noticeable .
neutral	the rugs are very thin and flimsy and are not the non_slip which they were advertised to be .
neutral	delivery was quick although thats the only good thing about the order !
neutral	the rugs are poor quality , massively over priced and i would not order any more .
neutral	all of the above is my own opinion of my experience with the rug_house .
neutral	all of the above is also factually correct to the best of my own knowledge .
neutral	i had to return my first mobile phone because of poor reception but found the next phone just the same however i feel i just have to put up with this .
neutral	i was looking for a double_buggy for when my second child is born in jan , but found it cheaper on another website , precious_little_ones was very easy to do a price match and better that price .
neutral	when i came to placing my order online i had problems entering the codes and contacting them at the weekend .
neutral	after a quick email i got a fast response on monday_morning asking me to contact them .
neutral	when i did this they placed my order easily over the phone at 0 . 00pm my order arrived at 0 . 00am the following_morning ( the fastest ive_ever known ).
neutral	yes product fine , but too slow on the postage !
neutral	the prices from buymobilephones are very good and a friend had good service from them .
neutral	the delivery service was also excellent .
neutral	however , the charger that arrived with my samsung_s0 did not work .
neutral	the lead was fine ( i tested it with another charger ).
neutral	the phone charged using alternative charger .
neutral	clearly the supplied charger was faulty .
neutral	i phoned their help_desk but was first asked if i was " plugging the charger in the correct hole ".
neutral	once i '_d clarified that i was (!)
neutral	they said they would need me to send everything back , including the phone .
neutral	it just wasn_'_t worth the hassle of me sending back my new phone which was working fine , and which i '_d loaded up with my personal information and apps , and to be without a phone for an_unknown number of days .
neutral	all for them to check the charger .
neutral	i declined and said i '_d buy myself a replacement charger as this would be cheaper_than the postage i '_d have to pay and much less hassle .
neutral	shame they couldn_'_t have just asked me to send back the charger on its own for them to check and replace .
neutral	received my quote online then envelope was received to post off my phone i had a response within 0_days , my quote was adjusted from what was quoted online but still | i did accept the offer .
neutral	money was in my account within 0_days .
neutral	the website has some great deals and good products however the delivery service is poor .
neutral	i ordered my item 00 days ago and has still not arrived .
neutral	i was told my item would arrive between 0 - 0_days .
neutral	this holiday was booked for 00 and at the last_minute 0 were unable to travel due to the death of my father ( grandfather for the other party member ) i was told no refund will be given and was very disapointed as this was not just someone not wanting to go .
neutral	it was essential non travel i am in the process of drafting a letter to head_office under the circumstances i would like to know if any kind of refund is available as £_000 is a lot of money to loose especially under these circumstances . other than this side i would consider_using travel_republic again but willwait to see how i get on with this matter
neutral	delivered to the wrong_address no . 0 not 00 ..... beautiful flowers cant_complain_about that .... but my mum didn_'_t get hers until_0pm after the person at no0 finally knocked on the right door ......
neutral	i even have the correct_address on my invoice .....
neutral	the shoes are great - excellent quality and so comfortable to wear .
neutral	unfortunately they took 00 days to arrive and not the specified 0 - 0_days .
neutral	i had booked 0 flights with flybe through bravofly - then found these reviews !
neutral	my worst fears were confirmed when the 00kg hold luggage each , which i had paid_extra for , showed on the flybe booking site as 00kg .
neutral	as we are cruising - we need big bags !
neutral	i experienced 0 really bad phone_calls to someone in india ( i think ) , who did not understand what i was complaining_about and left me on hold for ages before i hung_up .
neutral	i then contacted the contact on one of these posts - simona - who has sorted it , with no further charges .
neutral	( dont_know what the phone bill will be though !!)
neutral	so far so good !
neutral	!
neutral	i booked to sell two phones , but only received the packaging for one .
neutral	i then received an_email from envirofone saying gheir quote for the 0nd phone was about to expire !!
neutral	im now waiting for them to resend it !
neutral	!!
neutral	watch this space
neutral	i would like to know why have l not received 00 per_cent discount when l mentioned this over the phone before the job was done here and my email is being ignored .
neutral	in the past l have not received any discount .
neutral	could you please find out and let_me know .
neutral	kind_regards
neutral	munira
neutral	arrival was without a hitch , straight_into the car_park and not long after on the shuttle into the airport .
neutral	on our return however , we had to wait 00_minutes for a shuttle back to the car_park , which isn_'_t really ideal when 00 - 00_mins is the quoted time period .
neutral	watched many other shuttles fly past for other car_parks .
neutral	still looking for a car_park to use at this airport which does what it says on the tin as i fly from luton around twice a month .
neutral	i ordered cartridges for my hp_printer with the belief they were the genuine product however on arrival the cartridges were different and my printer does not recognise them .
neutral	i '_m a little_concerned that this is going to confuse the printer and disappointed as i paid over_£_00 for the order !
neutral	i bought flowers for a team member '_s birthday but they were not as ' gorgeous ' as i hoped .
neutral	perhaps more of the cost went on the speedy delivery than on the content of the bouquet ..
neutral	have always received a great service from partyrama .
neutral	my issue & hence the 0stars rating is to do with the product ordered .
neutral	last_week i needed a banquet_roll quickly - no_probs paid for the slightly quicker_than normal postage - job_done .
neutral	it arrived fine & with time to spare .
neutral	the ' green ' banquet_roll that i ordered & which looked a real bottle green online , was however , more like a pale_green - pistachio type colour - not what i wanted at all as this didn_'_t got with the other items we '_d got for our ' scottish ceilidh ' but as i '_d ordered it late on , i had no time to change it - lesson_learned !
neutral	took it in for aircon service , booked online - painless .
neutral	was upsold to have the anti_- bac £_00 .
neutral	asked them to do a safety check which was free .
neutral	when they did this they discovered a fault with the brakes (!
neutral	), i went_ahead with the repair £_000 !
neutral	collected the next_day - air_con wasn_'_t working !!
neutral	well , no better_than before it went in ( it was working before , i just wanted a service on it as it had been 0 years ).
neutral	they couldn_'_t take it back for a few_days .
neutral	took it back , oh there is a leak !
neutral	£_00 !!
neutral	and he was going to charge me for a regas too !
neutral	next_day - aircon not working !!
neutral	i called them , oh bring it back we will check it out , free of charge !!
neutral	well as i said to him , i '_m not confident , 0rd time ??
neutral	he said " well we ' re not aircon specialists !!
neutral	", he suggested i take it to a specialist !
neutral	i did , it was a relay switch , including diagnostic cost me £_00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	so , aircon alone cost me £_00 with halfords & £_00 with specialist !
neutral	!
neutral	next time , i '_ll go to the specialist !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a green & white seville swing_seat_cover .
neutral	when it arrived it was just green .
neutral	i was told i could send it back and once they received it , they would send out the green & white .
neutral	they then told me , the supplier no_longer provided the green & white and that the website was being corrected .
neutral	i decided to keep the green , even_though i don_'_t really like it !
neutral	but looking today , the website still is showing the green & white ...
neutral	excellent quick arrival of the product ( male espadrilles , navy_blue size 0 ) but far too narrow in the sizing for normal uk male sizes .
neutral	your foot overhangs either_side of the shoe base .
neutral	had problems , registered with opodo but said i wasn_'_t signed_up ... tried to sign up & said i was already signed_up .
neutral	ended_up completing booking " without signing in "
neutral	we arrived at the airport_parking place and found it was very well_organised .
neutral	our 0 regret was not taking picture evidence of the amount of petrol left in the tank ( we were sure that there was half a tank left , but our petrol light came on as soon as we left the car_park !)
neutral	or the mileage .
neutral	we would use the service again but would have to take evidence of the mileage and fuel gage before exiting the car !
neutral	just warning other buyers - get samples first !
neutral	it doesn_'_t look like oak - doesn_'_t act like oak - oak is a colour !
neutral	the facings covering the metal framework are not mitred appropriately so not entirely free from some diy .
neutral	this website is excellent for getting a few_pennies to a few_pounds back on your purchases , on the whole mose retailers are fantastic , but then on the other hand some of the retailers are very slow at paying your cash_back if they do at all , you just have to sit and wait , and wait and wait .......
neutral	some of the reatilers offer you good cashback and then dispute it and don_'_t pay it so it is a risk you take as this has happend to me 0 times with different vehicle insurance companies
neutral	even still its nice to know that the pennies mount_up into pounds
neutral	twice_now animed_direct have dispatched my cats cystitis pills never received , the most_recent order being 0000000 .
neutral	this is not acceptable and the second time i have had to do another emergency order and then claim back the prepaid funds for the lost orders later . no point in free delivery if it never arrives !
neutral	!
neutral	there sizing can be a little_bit on skimpy size
neutral	i believe the quality has taken a hit in last few_years and i was a big iceland fan stopped shopping there when i got bits of bone in frozen mince more than once
neutral	deal do not tally in the basket as advertised and all deals are for new customers not fair treatment of reliable .
neutral	loyal_customers
neutral	normally great on delivery front , however do not update their tracking website very well so you could be sitting in for a delivery that wont turn_up
neutral	good customer service get the mobile coverage i need no_problems there but a little_slow to resolve_issues and mobile site constantly having technical problems and very very slow to the speed of dial up !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the delivery of my order was excellent , the order itself was disappointing as it did not do what i expected it do and i had to buy an extra part .
neutral	the coffees ordered arrived so quickly & well_packaged .
neutral	to avoid_damage in transit .
neutral	i was rather disappointed with the actual taste of the coffee compared to the original ones for my coffee_maker .
neutral	unfortunately i returned them but others may find the taste ok .
neutral	individually_wrapped pods also a downside as i have a storage rack for pods which i couldn_'_t use with these .
neutral	i thought the results would be better , but i can see alot better_than before however i am still a year on somedays blurry and eye_drops needed .
neutral	i would still recommend .
neutral	i am disappointed that i paid_extra for a service and it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	i expect if you pay extra for something you as a company should deliver .
neutral	i needed to make bookings urgenty , and so it was helpful that the staff knew what they were doing , but i felt a bit pressured to make the decision within a specific time frame with no opportunity to change my mind
neutral	good product and price and when used before great accuracy re stock and delivery .
neutral	this time it was not in stock as indicated but a prompt phone_call alerted us to the problem .
neutral	subsequent delivery arranged did not appear so wasted day off work .
neutral	part of it arrived the next_morning ( on a saturday - i thought you didn_'_t deliver on saturdays ?)
neutral	then the rest the following_monday - another day off work .
neutral	bit disappointed this time .
neutral	i have found cex a very good store and the staff are very helpful .
neutral	but i have found that their surport service eg emailing them is very poor to the point that i had to email them about an xbox kinect that i purchased from their web_site and has of yet had still not recieved a reply from them .
neutral	i found this very poor service on their behalf .
neutral	yet their web_site is stating to contact them by email .
neutral	so not at all a happy_bunny
neutral	prompt delivery and happy with the online tools used to create photobook but it arrived bent due to poor packaging and now has a crease in the middle .
neutral	i renewed my travel_insurance on 0th_february and was promised thatthe renewal documents would be sent in the post .
neutral	upto 00th_february i am still_awaiting same , even_though iwas told it would take 0 / 00 days .
neutral	the pc is great looking and from my son really good spec .
neutral	what i haven_'_t liked is the box it came in had no padding or protection for such an expensive item .
neutral	then a few_days_later my son set it up for me , but noticed the front usb socket was bent inwards presenting it to be used .
neutral	to save hassle of sending it back he has bent it into place .
neutral	now up and running we have now come to the disappointment of the windows we paid for being an online server ?
neutral	when we picked it we were under the impression it would be the normal windows .
neutral	but in saying this my son bought his computer through them 0years ago and was disappointed to find he had been sold a build windows disk and not the full pro pack that you get in the shop .
neutral	apart_from these the pc is great , just struggling to use it with this rubbish windows server os
neutral	the box arrived with a big hole in the top and open , the pinata had broken on the bottom and had to fix it myself as havent got time to send you a picture when you migh not even replace it , the plates were also bent .
neutral	everything else was fine thankyou
neutral	bit disappointed quite sparse arrangement ..
neutral	part arrived and was well_packaged but was too small although the fittings were right , it was a microwave plate , but by the time i paid postage to get it and then postage to return it it would have been a very expensive microwave plate so i did not return it , it would be better if you could get them through currys at_least you woulx be able to see them , so really i wasted 00 pounds .
neutral	unfortunately my purchase did not arrive .
neutral	i notified woolovers after 0_days ( surely it would have arrived by then ?)
neutral	but was advised to wait 00 days before contacting them again .
neutral	i just hope i can resolve this dispute .
neutral	perhaps all parcels should be " tracked " as m & s do on mail order deliveries ?
neutral	my previous_purchases ( and there have been many !)
neutral	have arrived_safely and service excellent .
neutral	also subsequent large purchase arrived within a few_days but i am still_waiting for my pretty cardigan !
neutral	on holiday at moment but order didn_'_t arrive on time so not seen personalised sashes yet but no use now .
neutral	ordered saturday_evening but hadn_'_t arrived by 0am friday_morning , normally maximum of 0_days .
neutral	used site several_times before and products of good quality .
neutral	the post_office tried to deliver my parcel on saturday 0st_march , but as we were not in it was taken back to the sorting_office .
neutral	unfortunately no note was left to say this was the case .
neutral	so after chasing the company who had sent the parcel i contacted the sorting_office and was told that the parcel was awaiting my collection .
neutral	notvery impressive
neutral	placed my first order after being highly_recommended by a friend .
neutral	the discount_code i was given for 00_%_off my first order was wrong , so i emailed them to rectify it .
neutral	i got a response which made no sense whatsoever so re emailed and never_heard back .
neutral	then my order didn_'_t arrive , so i called customer service and they told me that a product was out of stock .
neutral	i asked them why they didn_'_t contact me and was told that some of the staff had been at a show that previous weekend .
neutral	brilliant .
neutral	this isn_'_t really a justifiable reason as i imagine that you should be able to still run a business when a few people take a day off .
neutral	not impressed at all
neutral	items took a good 00 days to arrive .
neutral	ok this was the busy_period of the year so i '_m_sure it isn_'_t like that normally .
neutral	having bought some sale items with a good deal money off for future presents for friends children and gaming evenings i '_m not so sure they were really that good a buy .
neutral	beautiful looking games and really good quality at a great price , just not sure of the playability and how much play time they will actually get .
neutral	i guess this is why they were in the sale .
neutral	some company '_s can predict a day , time and drivers_name on there delivery '_s , i feel frost auto restorations could really benefit this kind of system , boy you would be smart then .
neutral	usautomotive use this system .
neutral	your web_site is easy to use , got my product in a reasonable amount of time .
neutral	but feel if you were to pick_up on the above delivery system , you would be smarter .
neutral	great service , speedy delivery and free_returns advertised on site but when opening package you read delivery note to find out that if you do want to return the item the packaging has to be undamaged and the labels still attached , the label thing is fair because you should try things on with them still attached but the packaging ... who opens that carefully and i '_m_sure if they really wanted to they could re - attach the label with those small plastic things and they could replace damaged packaging .. ho hum no free_returns for me .
neutral	i ordered two bouquets to be delivered to a london venue for presentation to awards dinner_guests .
neutral	the bouquets were delivered on time and were acceptable though not fantastic , but they were delivered in a water bag without water which_meant they were already drooping by the time they were presented !
neutral	in addition i had specifically_requested that the water bag / bouquet was placed within a brightly_coloured square cardboard_box so it would stand independently and not pose a problem for the recipients - this did not happen and the bouquets therefore were tricky to deal with throughout .
neutral	the items were good but the card items would have been great if not completely bent in box / this was the photo frame the place signs and the boomerangs .
neutral	we were unable to straighten some of it
neutral	i placed my order and was emailed to say it had been received i was then emailed on the day of delivery to say an_error had occurred and the order was cancelled did i want the flowers delivered on the monday i did so needed to email back .
neutral	a courtesy_call would have been a better thing to do rather_than assume i '_d read my emails the flowers then arrived on the saturday as originally requested - very confusing
neutral	sailing to holland was great , made even better by a deal at check in where we paid to upgrade .
neutral	fab cabin , complete with double_bed , tv , mini_bar and tasty all you can eat breakfast .
neutral	checked in quickly and efficiently , enough car space to get in and out and a quick disembarkment .
neutral	refreshed and ready for our onward trip .
neutral	thanks dfds .
neutral	coming_back !
neutral	we had an awful experience .
neutral	we upgraded again at check in , once we had paid we were told the cabin had gone but they were unable to refund our card .
neutral	we were given euros which we didn_'_t want .
neutral	then we had a long , hot wait to get on board .
neutral	once on board our section was shoe horned in .
neutral	so much so that everyone found it difficult to get out of their vehicles !
neutral	some had to be moved as people were trapped .
neutral	some had to get out of windows !
neutral	i have pictures to show how close the cars were !
neutral	once we got on board an announcement said upgrades available !!!
neutral	i went to the desk to enquire and eventually upgraded , i was told i would have to pay 00_euros extra as it costs more if done on board .
neutral	i showed my receipt from shore and said how upset we were and then the lady agreed to charge the same amount .
neutral	if we had got the upgrade on shore we would not have had the parking nightmare we had just endured .
neutral	once in our new cabin the service was great !
neutral	the lounge with wifi was just what we needed and the tea , coffee and drinks went down well .
neutral	the cabin was roomy and comfortable .
neutral	the shower was powerful and hot and , again , the breakfast was great .
neutral	once we got back to the uk the people from the car at the front of the ramp did not return to their car until the boat was almost empty .
neutral	this meant none of the passengers could move !
neutral	again , this would not have happened if we had got our upgrade as we would have had better parking .
neutral	all in all we had a great trip , fab boat , lovely food and excellent entertainment .
neutral	looking_forward to our next trip x
neutral	flowers hadn_'_t been delivered by yodel by 0pm .
neutral	a neighbour spotted them in my mothers garden .
neutral	delivery note the following_day stated they had been left on the garage .
neutral	my parents don_'_t have a garage !
neutral	no delivery note through door .
neutral	my parents never left their property all day .
neutral	they love in a small bungalow !
neutral	i emailed customer_services 0_days ago with feedback .
neutral	still no response .
neutral	the flowers were lovely !
neutral	website fairly easy to use .
neutral	however , something went wrong when i paid , the site said i had paid , but then didn_'_t follow through .
neutral	i phoned ( reluctantly as it is not a free call ), got through easily to a " real " person to check whether my request had gone_through , which apparently it hadn_'_t .
neutral	i then tried again and it all went through ok .
neutral	i also asked a question using online_chat which was quickly answered .
neutral	i would prefer to make a telephone booking , but not if i have to pay for the call .
neutral	do not feel i can give a full review unless i have to claim and then i will find out how easy it is .
neutral	or not .
neutral	i was happy with the timing of the costume .
neutral	however there was a whole in the dress ... wouldn_'_t purchase off this site again
neutral	i ordered my wedding_invites off here , they where very good value and very simple to order and amend .
neutral	however the final product was not quite what i was expecting , the card was very flimsy , like a cheap christmas card and the detail was not as i imagined .
neutral	the image online gave a 0d or cut out effect , the final product was just a printed image .
neutral	my recent_purchase resulted_in me not getting what i actually thought i had ordered , on the main page which list all the exercise bikes my model states that it has a 00_kg flywheel the body sculpture bc 0000 indoor racing exercise_bike features a strong frame , large flywheel and adjustable saddle and handlebars .
neutral	the front stabiliser comes with transportation wheels so you can easily move this bike out of the way when you are done with your workout .

neutral	so you need to make_sure what the descriptions are
neutral	the battery arrived promptly .
neutral	although it was the correct voltage for my old bt telephone it is not recharging properly .
neutral	\ it may be the fault of my phone rather_than the battery ?
neutral	would not of ordered if i had know customer pays for return postage !
neutral	delivery is fine but packaging is poor .
neutral	only a small_amount of tape is used to hold parcel together .
neutral	all items put in one parcel which makes it heavy for delivery driver .
neutral	( 00kg )
neutral	easy ordering and turned_up when they were supposed to .
neutral	however the guy delivering said that they didn_'_t really have many purple or blue flowers , therefore leaving the bouquet looking a bit empty , and the flowers that were there are quite tatty and old looking .
neutral	won_'_t be using again unfortunately .
neutral	the service was excellen , t i did however think that the bouquet would have been bigger
neutral	the site has a great range and was exactly_what i was looking for , but the parcel was delivered about 0_days after the end of their delivery estimate and i didn_'_t hear from them after the order confirmation_email .
neutral	it would '_ve been nice to know that it would be late .
neutral	nice flowers rventually !!!
neutral	stressful waiting for delivery ...
neutral	text at 00 . 00 .
neutral	delivered at 0 . 00_pm !
neutral	i recently_purchased an item and thought i '_d use paypal , like i usually do .
neutral	now every time i have used it in the past they have only taken my card_details and everything else ( address etc_.)
neutral	i have entered manually .
neutral	with superdry however they took every piece of information from my paypal_account without warning me that they would do so .
neutral	so once i realised that the delivery address was taken from my paypal_account , i realised it would be delivered to the wrong place .
neutral	as it was late on sunday_evening i rang on monday_morning to change the address but it had already been dispatched .
neutral	they said they would call the courier service and change the address with them .
neutral	it took nearly 0_weeks for the item to arrive , two phone_calls ( one which took over 00_mins as the queue was so long ) and they even emailed me to say it had been returned to superdry and that they needed the correct_address .
neutral	i think in future they should warn customers that if they use the paypal option , all information will be taken from their account as i am sure there have been other people in a similar_situation to me .
neutral	the product description was not accurate , stated suitable for beginners where in fact it was more of a toy or display product .
neutral	it could not hold a tune , wrongly spaced frets .
neutral	however on contacting customer service they were very helpful and a full_refund and collection by courier for return of product was arranged .
neutral	quick online valuation and easy process , but we dropped the phones in on wednesday and didn_'_t receive payment until the following_monday - not within the 00_hours as promised .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	boots good however not impressed that day they arrived they went on sale saving a further £_00 . 00
neutral	dates of sales should be posted on web_site as places customers at unfair disadvantage .
neutral	regards .
neutral	if i was recommending this car_rental to a friend i would maybe get them to talk to the rental company direct to see what excess offers they could offer .
neutral	other than that i could not find any fault with athol vehicle hire
neutral	well i booked my new tyres to be put on in the morning but couldn_'_t do it till 0 . 00 in the afternoon not good at all .
neutral	but when they got on with it job was done well .
neutral	i ordered over the phone .
neutral	the radiator and valves arrived promptly and i was kept well informed re delivery but in fact the valves were the wrong sort - i ordered straight valves but in fact wall type valves were sent .
neutral	i have not yet taken this up with the company as my builder went out and bought the correct valves himself the same day as he was booked to fit them .
neutral	product looks good ( but i haven_'_t used it yet ).
neutral	the courier was awful though .
neutral	i had to pick it up as i wasn_'_t in when they delivered - hardest_thing ever !
neutral	they don_'_t answer the phone , they ' re on a massive industrial_estate but don_'_t provide maps , you have to duck under a barrier to get to the office where the reception is closed and you have to go through the drivers entrance where old desks and printers are lying_around - this doesn_'_t bother me but it made it very very difficult to know where the heck i was going !
neutral	then i had to wait for 00_minutes whilst i listened to the staff arguing with each other .
neutral	i waited all day and it eventually came late_afternoon i am disabled so needed them to carry it in for me , got the feeling that they didnt normally do that .
neutral	possibly a company with too much work and too few resources .
neutral	i had to chase them twice to get someone to come out to do a quote and i live in the clapham / oval area .
neutral	they blamed their computer_systems .
neutral	gentleman_who came to give the quote and who ended_up doing the job is very friendly , very efficient and listens carefully to what the customer wants .
neutral	i was told and the quote confirmed it would take 0 - 0_days .
neutral	it took just over a week , day - worked for a few hours on the first two_days then nothing for 0_days and then came back to complete the work on the 0th day .
neutral	again always friendly and a really nice person but i had chased the work up 0 times by phone and text_messages .
neutral	finished the work on friday at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	on saturday_morning i noticed 0 key bolts from the fence posts hadn_'_t been put in .
neutral	could be a great company because the staff are really friendly and know what they are talking_about just let_down by the quality of the communications with the client .
neutral	clients shouldn_'_t be chasing for information and work .
neutral	i wanted to file all my paperwork but could not get out to purchase one , so i purchased the product that i thought would work from the website of wham which i saw on t . v .
neutral	it was not to expensive and arrived to my door much sooner_than i expected it to arrive
neutral	nationwide were quick to deliver car but it is unclear when remainder of deposit will be taken from my account .
neutral	also the address on the direct_debit mandate is wrong !
neutral	on return at the ticket barrier we were advised that we had to pay £_00 .
neutral	we had already paid on line .
neutral	this also happened to our friends which_meant we both had to call the customer service , look for our documents to give the reference_number .
neutral	does this happen to everyone ,?. if so really inefficient process and the last thing that a traveller needs on return from holiday !
neutral	i received the parcel today from fedex and although i know that the courier is paid according to weight or volume , i was very surprised to see that my items were in a box about 00 cm x 00 cm and actually only just covered the floor of the box , the rest was empty air .
neutral	did i pay an extra gbp 00 for the volume , or for the weight , as the items could of been put in a padded_envelope and sent through the post .
neutral	flowers delivered but delivery did not wait for the recipient to answer the door before leaving calling_card - disappointed .
neutral	wonder_how flowers will be received after a day at a holding station ?
neutral	sadly the florist did not have what i wanted to order , i was phoned and informed very quickly and a replacement was offered , however i had no idea of what was eventually sent .
neutral	i ordered next say delivery flowers after christmas and they weren_'_t delivered until over a week_later .
neutral	i was kept_informed at each point of delay , the main_reason there were no flowers in the aberden area ,
neutral	i received a text at 0 . 00am to say my flowers had left the building .
neutral	i waited all day for an update or my daughter in law to phone and say thank_you .
neutral	by 0pm i had given up and telephoned my son to ask him to phone you as i was not able to .
neutral	0 . 00 my daughter in law phoned we chatted away then approx 0 . 00 i heard their door_bell she said hold on and went to the door instantly !
neutral	she said their are flowers on my door_step .
neutral	the deliver had not even waited .
neutral	very dissapointing .
neutral	having booked and paid with you it was frustrating to b stopped at the barrier as we owed another £_00 !
neutral	sent flowers to my daughter who is a florist .
neutral	she said they were lovely , but they arrived in 0 bunches and greenery to be arranged by her .
neutral	thought the idea of sending flowers to somebody was for them to receive them already arranged .
neutral	are all their flowers sent like this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the only problem i had was i forgot to book extra leg_room when i doing the inital booking when i rang the office who could deal with the problem it was closed bank_holiday week end i rang on the tuesday only to be told after a ten minuit wait to ring 0_weeks before traveling so thats another phone_call on premium_rate and another ten minuite wait while they ring the air line to see if i can have extrra leg_room last time i only booked the apartment with them and booked the seperatly i got the extra leg_room no problem no_messing_about i cant under stand why they have telephone the air line
neutral	no idea when the order was going to arrive as the email that stated they had been dispatched was sent after the goods had arrived .
neutral	some food tins damaged on opening the package .
neutral	would think_twice before buying again from bikeinn as they do not update responses .
neutral	its a waiting game .
neutral	you can '_t do anything .
neutral	i needed just 00_hours cover to enable me to drive a car that i had just purchased home on a sunday when my insurance company was not available on the phone .
neutral	after filling in all my details i was given several options to choose from .
neutral	i just chose the cheapest , filled in the rest of my details and that was it , i was covered for the 00 miles journey home .
neutral	the only_drawback was that i was told there would be an_email_confirmation but so far nothing has arrived .
neutral	i bought the regency boy costume - it stated white shirt with collar , actually received a collar .
neutral	tie was of disappointing quality but most disappointing was the hat .
neutral	very flimsy felt type fabric .
neutral	jacket & trousers were just like in the photo but the hat was a completely_different item from the photo as well as the shirt & tie not being of the same quality as in the photo .
neutral	postage seemed expensive too .
neutral	lovely rug but took their time in delivering .
neutral	after_placing my order i waited 0_weeks and still hadn_'_t had a confirmation_email or any indication of when my delivery would be .
neutral	i called them and mentioned this and the guy on the phone said ' oh it '_s sitting here next to me , shall i send it out ?"
neutral	er yes , obviously !
neutral	rug arrived fine well_packaged and as i said is really lovely , but can '_t help wondering how long it would have continued to ' sit there ' if i hadn_'_t phoned .
neutral	flowers didn_'_t arrive until very end of the day and courier didn_'_t even ring the bell , just left them by the front_door !
neutral	customer service was good but can '_t avoid the fact that the dualit_toaster i received was damaged , then had to wait a week for new stock / them to pick_up .
neutral	easy to do when understanding the inward and outward journeys on the same day .
neutral	difficult to try and co ordinate tours in ireland with journey '_s outward and inward on same day .
neutral	sailing times make for a long day , especially with young_children .
neutral	still looking_forward to the day what ever the weather .
neutral	i had to enter all of my details 0 times !
neutral	got to the page to fill in my details , which i did , then clicked to go to the next page , to pay & 0 times it kicked me back to the flight selection page , saying that the availability or price had changed - none had changed .
neutral	finally on the 0th attempt ( once i decided to do a quick register ) it worked .
neutral	is this just a scam to get people to register ?
neutral	why not make it mandatory ??
neutral	?
neutral	i '_ve had many shoes from ecco in fact they are the only ones i wear .
neutral	on line is my only option as there are no ecco shops in skipton .
neutral	the boots i recently sent back just would not zip up because of fat legs .
neutral	i was very disappointed eecially as i had to pay £ 0 .
neutral	00 to return them to sweden .
neutral	i '_m_sure you once operated a free return .
neutral	i love ecco_shoes but not your boots and no more online buying for me .
neutral	jan in the yorkshire dales
neutral	the customer service and contact was absolutely_brilliant and the speed that the repairs were done ( and the phone returned ) were great .
neutral	it was also really well_packaged when it was returned .
neutral	the only problem was that the charging point ( where you plug the charger in ) was slightly misaligned following the repair .
neutral	the phone still charges but it takes a lot of jiggling to get the plug into the phone due to it being at an angle now .
neutral	was very slow with letting_me know they had the phone and sending the cheque out .
neutral	mazuma_mobile was much_quicker .
neutral	need to get your prices down for , like my hermes
neutral	i ordered two bright side plant markers .
neutral	condition not good at all .
neutral	both very badly made .
neutral	won_'_t be buying them again .
neutral	surprised as other items from store have been excellent .
neutral	due to having small children i opted for the mobile service to replace my 0 worn tyres .
neutral	the job was completed successfully but :
neutral	a ) the man was later than my 0 hour_slot ( by 00_minutes ) and
neutral	b ) he was very overworked and grumpy and had been busy all morning .
neutral	i am undecided as to whether i would use this service again despite the reasonable_price .
neutral	although i respect all flowers are seasonal the flowers that i ordered were totally different in colour and variety to what is displayed on your website .
neutral	would not order by internet again .
neutral	bbw products are great - when you can get them .
neutral	delivery is brilliant - very prompt .
neutral	and this would be an easy 0_* review - but why oh why are so many products ' out of stock ' for so long ??
neutral	ok so they ' re popular and i have been told in answer to so many of my emails that ' natural products are very popular and difficult to obtain '.
neutral	some products i wanted were ' out of stock ' for over three_months , whilst i was being promised they would be ' in next week '!
neutral	i actually questioned whether bbw was closing_down !!
neutral	so please bbw - make_sure you have enough supplies in the warehouse to meet demand - don_'_t let stocks run_out before ordering more .
neutral	and why display products on your website with a full description etc etc - only to have a note at the bottom saying ' discontinued by manufacturer '??
neutral	- so take it off the site .
neutral	seempelz .
neutral	product was good once it finally arrived but it took over a week , i wouldn_'_t mind if it was free_p_&_p you can '_t complain then , but when you have to pay for it and wait ages ................ also none of the packs had scoops in them - you have to buy these apparently !
neutral	i would have thought mp could at_least run to the right sized plastic scoop in the bags !!!
neutral	so as a matter of principle i weighed out the correct amount and found the right sized spoons in my own collection !
neutral	had the product i required , and at a good price , however , it was meant to be delivered within 0 working_days , when this wasn_'_t achieved i emailed asking why , waited 0_days for a reply to be told that my item wasn_'_t in stock after all and i had to wait a few extra days on top of what i was originally told
neutral	i placed my order on - line on 0 / 0 / 00 without having read the customer reviews about this company .
neutral	after_reading some of the comments and being a first time customer from the uk , i must_admit to being rather alarmed and i started to worry that my order would not arrive .
neutral	after a couple of weeks with no communication from the company , i sent an e_- mail asking if they could advise as to when i could expect delivery of my order .
neutral	i received no response whatsoever but thankfully , on 0 / 0 / 00 i received my order which was in perfect_condition and well_packaged .
neutral	the perfume smells authentic and the boxes are in perfect_condition .
neutral	i would urge the company to review their customer_relations policy as it leaves a lot to be desired and customers need to be confident that their enquiries will be answered in a timely and satisfactory way .
neutral	when we encounter a problem it is very hard to get a prompt response .
neutral	companies like ups , dhl etc wont talk to us because as far as they ' re concerned the " customer " is interparcel .
neutral	when we phone interparcel with an issue it can take a whole day or more for someone to look into the problem , often they don_'_t report back and we have to keep phoning them .
neutral	i have stopped using interparcel for international_shipments as i feel it '_s too much of a risk .
neutral	/ got my kitten in august_0000 and began using petplanet straight_away , i was very impressed by the quality of goods , customer service and prompt delivery .
neutral	however , since january_0000 , this prior excellent delivery has_been very poor , which is very disappointing as i love their products but can '_t rely_on delivery and as i use specialis litter , and cannot_afford to not receive it in time replace old litter .
neutral	i was very pleased with feedback from my mother in law she absolutely loved her flowers the only_criticism i have was the lack of acknowledgement from you on placing my order i did not receive an_email_saying you had received my order this caused me to panic a bit as i wasn_'_t sure if order had gone_through , i emailed you to check if order had been receive but got no reply until delivery wa s ready to go out three_days_later , i was about to order from another shop when i got a message_saying flowers had been delivered , i buy a lot on the internet , each time i get an_email_saying order has_been received . hoping this was helpful yours_sincerely mrs_c darby
neutral	i have looked through the manual - looks very complicated .
neutral	i didn_'_t try to use the camera as i am still_waiting for a memory_card .
neutral	i must_say the english description will be better_than chinese .
neutral	a couple of points are not clear .
neutral	i wonder_if there is a product / after sales care help available with this item ?
neutral	regards ,
neutral	tanya callison
neutral	t . callison @ sky . com
neutral	i would definitely recommend using cex for buying and selling .
neutral	although their credit voucher service for goods sold to them is only useful if you are going to go into one of their stores within a few_days of receiving it .
neutral	i used the service to buy a difficult to come by dvd at a reasonable cost .
neutral	the dvd was received within a couple of days and i also made money by selling back a few of our unwanted dvds , so i like the fact that it '_s very environmentally_friendly .
neutral	the credit was sent to me via_e_- mailed voucher which again , was very prompt .
neutral	the only_negative i would say is that i found it difficult on their website to find information on receiving credit for dvds sold to them via voucher .
neutral	i think it could be done more quickly if you could receive the credit against whatever you buy from them in one transaction .
neutral	i had to post my dvds that i was selling to them , they sent me a credit voucher and then i ordered t he goods i wanted and have had to print_off and send them their voucher in the post !
neutral	it has_been a week_later and i still_haven_'_t received a credit back to my card for the cost of their voucher .
neutral	another negative is the fact that the voucher they send is only valid for a week from the date they send it out .
neutral	les tarifs sont compétitifs mais le désagrément de_livraison que_j ' ai rencontré m ' a déplu ( j ' ai passé commande le 0 décembre 0000 et à_ce jour , soit le 00 décembre 0000 , je_n ' ai toujours pas reçu mon_colis ).
neutral	everyone raves on about memory_foam mattresses but not that impressed with it and the moment and think it is giving me more back_ache then before .
neutral	there was suppose to be a free pillow with the mattress as some sort of promotion and it never came .
neutral	this was my first order with boohoo . com it was free delivery ( with code ) and free_returns .
neutral	i sent for 0 pairs of leggins in the sale at £ 0 . 00 a pair . the sizes were 00 / 00 and m / l to fit my daughter who is a size 00 , but only one pair was a perfect_fit and another pair fit ok .
neutral	the other three pairs she could not even get them past her knees .
neutral	don_'_t know if i would order from them again as you have to pay for delivery normally .
neutral	the flowers turned_up not long after i ordered , which i was very pleased with .
neutral	however they have opened very quickly and i did expect a few more stems .
neutral	if i am really in trouble with the other half i will use again for the speed , but if it was for a special_occasion i would look elsewhere .
neutral	the product i bought was a wok with a lid - it is lovely and i '_m very pleased with it .
neutral	however , the company you use as a courier - yodel - are pants .
neutral	they did not deliver when they should have done , and when the box arrived it was battered to bits .
neutral	thankfully , someone had put ample bubble rap round the goods , so it was undamaged - but the bottom of the box was almost falling open !
neutral	you should change the courier .
neutral	it took me a while to realise if i didn_'_t put my bank details that you wouldn_'_t remind_me .
neutral	also it wasn_'_t very clear what to click on to , to input my details .
neutral	now i know i will shop more
neutral	thanks
neutral	i have used medicanimal for a long time , ordering food and sundries for my two dogs on a regular_basis .
neutral	their service has always been great , and the delivery company used until recently ( which was dpd ) excellent .
neutral	however , they appear to have changed delivery provider and now use yodel , who are awful .
neutral	they say they have tried to deliver when they haven_'_t , they say they '_ve put a card through the door when they haven_'_t , and all for deliveries that do not require a signature and for which a safe location to leave the parcel has_been specified .
neutral	the delivery experience is now bad enough to make me consider_using a different company to purchase from which is a shame as i '_ve had no issue at all in the past .
neutral	please reconsider and go back to dpd - you will lose custom if you don_'_t i '_m_sure !
neutral	i was pleasantly_surprised that despite only placing the order in the afternoon , the item ( xmas_tree ) was delivered the following_day .
neutral	however , unfortunately i was sent a wrong item so it took me a few phone_calls to festive_lights to sort_out the swap .
neutral	i wasn_'_t impressed with the confusing info i was given regarding when the wrong tree would be collected and new / right tree delivered and , in the end , the swap didn_'_t take place on the agreed day .
neutral	but having finally received the correct item , i '_m happy with the purchase and the quality of the tree .
neutral	i was happy with the product i purchased but delivery was very slow .
neutral	we were initially very disaponted with the facilities of the villa compared to others booked through other_companies .
neutral	the outside terrace area looked like it had no attention with old lilo from previous occupants just strewn and there was a plastic_bag flaring in the pool .
neutral	only 0 outside chars and 0 sun_beds for an 0 capacity villa .
neutral	there were only 0 wine_glasses and insufficient tumblers as well .
neutral	having phoned the company to express our concerns they did deal with them swiftly .
neutral	it was just a shame that the villa wasn_'_t fully_equipped before arrival .
neutral	i was really pleased at finding the product i was after with a reasonable postal charge .
neutral	however , i am disappointed that 0_days_later i still have not received my goods and i have to wait_until 00 days before i can ask for an investigation .
neutral	i appreciate that this is the postal service that enforce this restriction but it is extremely frustrating when i '_m waiting for a product that i need to assist me with my sports training .
neutral	we arrived having received an e_mail giving us codes to enter the gate to obtain keys .
neutral	it was dark and trying to see the key pads was difficult .
neutral	we entered the garage using the code provided but could not find the parking place for the flat we had booked .
neutral	we telephoned the property manager who informed us that underground parking was not included in the booking , as we had been sent the garage door code we were surprised to hear this .
neutral	a telephone_call to blue_chip by the property manager revealed the incorrect e_mail had been sent .
neutral	blue_chip arranged for a parking place to be made available and an_apology recieved .
neutral	the flat was clean and functional but we did feel it lacked personality .
neutral	we presume that this property is new to blue_chip and is awaiting the finishing_touches .
neutral	i was very impressed with the products and their appeal online and pleased with the quality on arrival to be used for my childrens baking parties business .
neutral	however i feel the company who delivered the products could be letting you down .
neutral	i ordered products to be delivered while i was away on holiday ready for use on my return .
neutral	i specifically left details for the parcel to be left with neighbours or in our shed and left the back gate open for this purpose .
neutral	on my return i discovered the aprcels had been left in my garden and were soaked through .
neutral	i ordered cardboard_boxes and while wrapped in plastic_bags inside these too were soaked through leaving the party boxes damp and not top quality .
neutral	as i needed them a few_days_later i could not order more soon enough and so had to do the best i could .
neutral	i was very dissapointed with this service and it would make me think seriously before ordering again .
neutral	i ordered the bathrobe for a birthday_present .
neutral	ordered on 0 september for a birthday on 00 september , i thought that was plenty of time to receive it .
neutral	on 00 september my account stated that the item had been dispatched
neutral	i emailed towels_r_us on 00 september asking when it had been sent .
neutral	automated_reply only .
neutral	00 september came and went , no birthday_present .
neutral	i phoned customer_services on 00 september she took my mobile number and would get the right person to call me back , quess what no call !
neutral	!
neutral	00 september parcel arrived , city_link next_day delivery label shows date of 0 september ..... where had it been for 0_days ?
neutral	i was pleased with the easy to use website and speedy delivery , delivery guys were very friendly and helpful , however this service was spoilt by a pushy after sales call to pay £ 0 . 00 a month for free parts / repair service on a washer that had just cost the best part of £_000 and had 0yrs warranty .
neutral	i was pressured to accept free 00 day trial but caller pushed for bank details to set_up a continuous dd when i declined i felt a lot of pressure to justify my decision and the guy kept going in order to brow beat me , when he was getting_nowhere he retracted the free 00 day trial .
neutral	left me feeling reluctant to use the company a again and would definitely be wary of after sale calls .
neutral	i do a lot of online shopping and not experienced this pressure from a company before , made me feel very sceptical of a service if it has to be forced on customers .
neutral	going out waited half hour , was not happy as they kept saying be there in 0 min why say that should of said be a while .
neutral	coming_back had 0 little_ones driver was so helpfull helped load car etc and shot of so was not able to give him a tip
neutral	i tried to order for the saturday , as the birthday was on sunday but i could not get the site to work so ended_up getting there late .
neutral	i would not use the site again , sorry .
neutral	internet sale all easy & clear .
neutral	however received an_email which said it would be delivered over 0_days_later ( instead of the 0 - 0 working_days it stated ).
neutral	rang up to enquire_about this & they changed it to a saturday delivery .
neutral	however after all this the tv did not arrive on the saturday .
neutral	the journey to and from the tour was fine with no_problems .
neutral	the only setback is that you have set times for returning to london and this seriously limits your time at the tour .
neutral	we only had 0 hours and this was nowhere_near long enough .
neutral	towards the end of the tour i was having to rush round the last part and in fact totally walked through one whole section as i wanted to look around the gift shop .
neutral	i was very disappointed with this as i was also again rushing_around the gift shop .
neutral	it is expensive for a 0 hour trip and felt i had not seen or done all i wanted to do .
neutral	in fact i have re - booked to visit the tour but will make my own way there and back as i will get all the time i need and it works out much_cheaper .
neutral	i order a pair of fins especially for a diving holiday .
neutral	they were advertised as being in stock and were , apparently , dispatched to me after 0_days .
neutral	when they did not arrive i contacted the shop only to find that were not in stock and had to be ordered from the manufacturer .
neutral	the shop were polite and offered to cancel the order but the price was good so i decided to stick with it and wait .
neutral	they did not arrive until i returned home from my holiday .
neutral	they look good and fit well but i have , as yet , not had a chance to try them in water .
neutral	felt a bit_cheated as they gave_me a voucher number for free insurance and then didn_'_t have any way of redeeming it .
neutral	when i purchased this product i didn_'_t expect the expiry_date to be the month that was nearly over already !
neutral	i hope it still works ..... or else waste of money .
neutral	i '_ve_used ' cheaper ' photo - books before but , wanting to support jessop / new company , decided to give them my business .
neutral	found the process more complicated than other similar_companies but , from experience , have always had clearer and better quality photos from jessops - at_least for printed photos .
neutral	first time i '_ve_used jessops for photo - book so looking_forward to the results .
neutral	it took me 0 hours to unpack the item and dispose of a mountain of polystyrene and cardboard .
neutral	as i 00 year_old this was a difficult_task , one i do not want to repeat .
neutral	it was nice to sell me phone to muzuma_mobile and i would tell friends to do the same .
neutral	rose is beautiful . really pleased however delivery was a nightmare . gave clear_instructions to leave at moxoms joinery if we were not in , card was posted at number 00 next door not the annexe as written on my adreess , had to track parcel on internet to find out where it had gone and then try to locate thepost office where it had been left . luckily we have a god relationship with our neighbours at number 00 but meant that delivery was unaccounted for fofr 00_hrs so missed the date i wanted it to arrive for . apart_from the delivery i am extremely pleased with the rose
neutral	i received my sweet trooper helmet quickly after ordering it , which was much_appreciated .
neutral	however , the bag it came in was without a draw and the bag was damaged in parts , which was annoying to hold it closed to protect my helmet from falling out .
neutral	when spending 000gbp i '_d like an eye for that sort of detail !
neutral	a good product and procook very professional but the delivery was not as straightforward and i would not recommend yodel as a carrier
neutral	online ordering a sublime experience !
neutral	you know what is happening to your order almost minute by minute !
neutral	however going to to have to return as the jacket colourway i ordered ( desperately wanted grey / orange !)
neutral	only came in small and other colours came in xs ( ie pink / black ) so what happened there ?
neutral	i '_m swamped .
neutral	don_'_t want a subsitute .
neutral	very difficult to speak to anyone after purchase .
neutral	was charged for handset when it was supposed to be free still_waiting for refund .
neutral	flowers delivered ok next_day , unfortunately 0 roses dead within 00_hours , lilies one stem dead in 0_days , very disappointed as they usually last a while & that is why i chose them .
neutral	sorry but i will not use again .
neutral	asda do great prices , no denying that , and the people instore are usually very friendly .
neutral	however online is slightly_different experience .
neutral	out of the many_times ive ordered online , ive either had to pay £ 0 . 00 or more for a slot , since even_though ive looked for a slot a day or two in_advance , none are available .
neutral	how many delivery people do they have ?
neutral	0 ?
neutral	0 ?
neutral	not enough thats for sure .
neutral	also , i cant think of an order we '_ve recieved that hasnt had a little_bit on the top saying ' sorry these products werent avaliable in store so havent been delivered ' and this is usually about 0 or 0 products from my list .
neutral	i really cant imagine that so much stock changes that much in just a couple of days .
neutral	and to top it off , most of my food usually comes in damaged packages , and sometimes even the products themselves are battered about .
neutral	but the delivery guy isnt interested in it and there is no email address for customer service , you have to phone up to complain .
neutral	which , for how long it took me one time to sort it out , isnt worth the time or phone bill .
neutral	i ordered the " circle of love " which is advertised on the site as coming with a pot ( the one pictured ont he site was lovely ) but instead it came in a rather cheap looking basket .
neutral	part of the unique and nice thing about the arrangement was the long grass leaves that formed circles around the outside of the flowers and the folded leaves around the edge of the pot but neither of those two niceties were in bunch when it arrived .
neutral	nice flowers , but what arrived was compartively cheap looking compared to what i thought i ordered .
neutral	can '_t fault the speed of service - ordered about 0 . 00 and arrived by 0pm .
neutral	after 00 days i am still_waiting delivery of my order .
neutral	i requested a time for the parcel to be picked_up , but unfortunately , the courier didn_'_t turn_up in the allotted_time .
neutral	when i rung the customer_services , i was basically told tough_luck that i had to work and that i didn_'_t know anyone who didn_'_t work who could sit in all day .
neutral	the time had to be rebooked for the next_day .
neutral	the courier still didn_'_t turn_up within the allotted_time , but fortunately a family_member hadn_'_t started their shift and the parcel was collected .
neutral	parcel was delivered the next_day at_least
neutral	hello the flowers were beautiful but very small compared to the picture - this picture is not accurate at all !!
neutral	i even paid_extra for the deluxe_version and was gobsmacked at how they arrived - i expected a lovely bouquet well put_together with foliage and actually got two little bouquets - no foliage at all - it was unlike any flower delivery i had seen .
neutral	i
neutral	admittedly the day is hot but when the box arrived - not how i expected them to turn_up at all !!
neutral	especially_considering the spiel you get from the company of how they should be packaged " very comfortably , very securely , and very elegantly " the box was double the size of the flowers and they were not securely fastened so could fly from one side of the box to the other and looked a little like they had done just that when they arrived .
neutral	the box was quite beat up and had some tears so i was concerned at how the flowers would appear .
neutral	a friend told me about the company and she was shocked when the box arrived and said she never_experienced this problem so this may just be a one off .
neutral	however , the flowers themselves are very unique and once i had sorted them and trimmed the ruined ones so they looked more presentable , they did get lots of comments .
neutral	the company were excellent in telling_me about delivery and keeping_me informed so this was good also .
neutral	i '_m always disappointed with the " hard_sell " of the insurance , and unfortunately your company was no exception .
neutral	i finally gave in and had the excess covered because i was so afraid of everything .
neutral	also , i was not given the size of car i was promised .
neutral	i was supposed to get a fiat_panda or similar .
neutral	i got a fiat_000 which , as you know is smaller .
neutral	i '_m not happy about that and think that you should credit something to my card .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	it was a quick service for them to post the bag to our house , but when they posted the cheque it took 0_days before it was posted and this was a friday so didn_'_t get to is till the tuesday because it was 0nd_class , postage needs to be improved
neutral	very nice flowers - the recipient said they were beautiful but problem in online transaction ... original recipient address and greeting were lost by e . florist and all had to be put through a second time . l . but fairplay to the customer service team they
neutral	apologised_profusely and dealt_with it all .
neutral	communication could be better , stock_availability could be better .
neutral	the goods arrived impressively fast , however , 0 toys were broken .
neutral	wrapping of some items were not very good .
neutral	won_'_t use site in future - will pay cash in shop and swipe card .
neutral	at oakland i finally found the bedside_cabinet i was looking for .
neutral	the salesman gave_me the full spiel regarding polish , aftercare and replacement policy as if i was buying a full bedroom_suite , etc .
neutral	even_though i had turned this down .
neutral	he automatically_added polish to my bill without giving me the option to say no .
neutral	when the item was delivered the unwanted polish was not included .
neutral	when i called the after sales service they said the documentation showed i had taken the polish at the time of purchase , which was untrue .
neutral	i had to make another trip to the store to pick it up .
neutral	in fairness to the store they didn_'_t quibble and apologised for the inconvenience .
neutral	on a separate point , i think oakland is missing a trick by not assembling the furniture in the designated room .
neutral	sorting_out any_problems once the delivery men have left would be a pain .
neutral	need to learn a lesson from marks and spencer , who do offer the unpacking / removal of packaging service .
neutral	i have stayed in numerous villas and you cannot_fault the space of villa cabrera however there were some things that let it down and would prevent me booking it again especially for £ 0000 for x0 weeks ( x0 adults for 00 nights and x0 adult 0 nights ) when there are other villas in the area that look nicer ( from walking around and doing some investigative work for our next holiday ) and when checked are cheaper
neutral	the positives
neutral	- lovely position for us at faro park , away from the hustle and bustle .
neutral	- excellent , cheap supermarket just 0 mins_walk_away from the villa
neutral	- excellent cafe , la moka that also does fabulous cakes and pastries
neutral	- excellent and reasonably_priced restaurants ( italian and spanish ) again just 0 mins_walk from the villa
neutral	- very spacious_villa , there was only 0 of us ( sleeps 0 ) but you never felt on top of each other
neutral	- air_con was very good when required
neutral	- pool_table and table_tennis added an extra touch
neutral	improvements
neutral	- when we arrived the broken washing_machine had been left in the outdoor dining_area , this was flagged on our first full day but was still there when we left x0 weeks_later !
neutral	didn_'_t impact our stay but doesn_'_t sell the property
neutral	- tlc required in lounge to fix the dint in the wall
neutral	- tlc required in master_bedroom to fix a small dint and repaint over the scuff marks .
neutral	also the plaster started to fall_off the wall by the mirror
neutral	- pool only cleaned once during x0 week stay , when compared to other villa_holidays in lanzarote this is the least i have seen somewhere cleaned .
neutral	when we took pool cover off on first day there was a dead grass / seaweed we had to get out of bottom of pool
neutral	- plant_pot outside by patio_doors had dead tree in it and had been used as a bin ( rubbish and broken glasses inside )
neutral	- no outdoor plant life - the villa has a lot of outside_space and there is scope to add plants etc to make it more_homely
neutral	i wouldn_'_t rush back to this villa for the price we paid .
neutral	i was very please with the delivery of the flowers but very disappointed in the amount of flowers i received for the money i spent .
neutral	i had upgraded to the deluxe display and thank god i did as this was no where near worth the £_00 i paid so goodness no '_s what the £_00 . 00 bunch would have been like .
neutral	morrisons , tesco and m & s are far better value for money .
neutral	we have only started_using paymentsense , and my impression so far is that their agents are quick and responsive .
neutral	however , i have a feeling that they are wee_bit more concerned_about getting our business / feedback ( like this one ) than caring about us , which i sincerely_hope that i am mistaken .
neutral	but i hope they will keep_up with their good work though .
neutral	i ordered 0 x pots of senna on 0st may_0000 and they have been deliveres on 00 th may !
neutral	the box they were packed into measured 00 x 00 x 00 cms for 0 plastic bottles measuring 0 x 0 . 0 cms !!
neutral	no wonder they charge delivery at £ 0 . 00 for a purchase of £ 0 . 00 !
neutral	i ordered these same items before to be deliverd via my daughter in brighton , but as they were also packed into an_enormous_box , they were not delivered .
neutral	i have given them a second chance with this order , i am unlikely to give them a third try !
neutral	shoes are lovely
neutral	delivery service
neutral	arrived 0 . 00 on a saturday_evening - just put kids to bed
neutral	woke both kids up
neutral	prices are very good and the delivery is fast ( but delivery company give no options on dates or times and i am at work monday to friday ) but the quantity delivered was wrong .
neutral	this is frustrating because i now have to contact chemist_direct to request a refund and if they want the whole shipment back i will not be available for the parcel company
neutral	i have bought previously and not had a problem although i needed to go and collect my parcel from the depot as i had not been in when parcel was being delivered .
neutral	there is no option on the chemist_direct website to make any requests about delivery or any information on what type of service this is - royal_mail is easier for me as i have a local_depot to collect from and not a 00 minute drive_away
neutral	my grandaughter has not received the goods yet
neutral	i ordered an item days prior to a birthday , as they website was showing stock .
neutral	several days_later i was informed that there in fact was none available .
neutral	i was asked to choose an_alternative ; which i did ( a slightly cheaper item ) only to be told late in the day that if i called and paid an additional £_00 they would ship it .
neutral	after pointing_out their error , they did apologise and ship my item ; unfortunately by this time too late for the birthday .
neutral	overall not very impressed .
neutral	good customer service but not the best steak , so far it has_been tough and on the tasteless side which is a dissapointment
neutral	previou s experiences very positive , but not this time .
neutral	was kept waiting 0_days for delivery , had to buy elsewhere , so rejected delivery when it finally arrived on the advice of animed .
neutral	have now been waiting 0_days for a refund .
neutral	i can not believe_how easy it was to get this holiday booked .
neutral	my daughter is getting_married in america and i had no idea how to go about this .
neutral	we wanted to go somewhere warm after the wedding as well .
neutral	michelle at holiday please was fantastic .
neutral	i emailed her so many_times with lots of questions .
neutral	she came back with all of them answered .
neutral	i booked almost_immediatly .
neutral	great company .
neutral	i will recommend to all my friends .
neutral	i was disappointed with the fact that the coffee bars were not operating on the day cruise .
neutral	the main course carvery at lunchtime was also disappointing .
neutral	we booked a one night stay over the weekend to blackpool to take our son and five year_old granddaughter for the illuminations , and got a cheap deal with ebookers for the savoy hotel .
neutral	when we arrived and tried to check in to the rooms , the company had booked one room in for saturday_night and the other room for the night before and it took reception over 0 hours to sort it out , which was very annoying as our granddaughter was getting_bored , we had pre_- booked for nickleodeon land in the pleasure beach and the delay messed the day up for us .
neutral	we won_'_t be booking again with the company , as the service wasn_'_t satisfactory .
neutral	as i booked last_minute for a same day departure , the records of stress_free parking had not logged our booking , so we were not expected and therefore there was noone to meet us .
neutral	the drop_off was all sorted within 00_minutes and we had plenty of time for our flight .
neutral	if we had been in a rush , this would have been more of a problem .
neutral	however , for the return , there were no_hiccups and all worked seemlessly .
neutral	i had eye_surgery done two years_ago , the optimax in southend were very friendly .
neutral	i had to have the procudure with the longer recovery i can not remember the name now .
neutral	the procudure was not pleasent but not too painful .
neutral	the day i had it done it was a bright sunny day which did not help the drive home was difficult .
neutral	i was in a lot of pain for the next 0_days i could not be in any light and i could not open my eyes .
neutral	the sleeping pills they provided were excellent i could sleep on and off all day which helped also the eye_drops which numbed the eyes were like heaven !
neutral	i could not have been by myself as i could not open my eyes .
neutral	however the pain and discomfort was well_worth it i can see excellent now and i have no need to wear glasses .
neutral	my mum_loved the flowers she received and the choice serenata offers makes it really easy to treat someone special .
neutral	however there was some_confusion before they were delivered due to the end destination experiencing flooding ... i was emailed to ask if i wanted to cancel my order ( considerate ) but then when i went to try ( the next_morning after pm email ) i was told it was too late and no alternative solution was offered .
neutral	i was then worried for the next 0_days as to whether my flowers would arrive .
neutral	they did in the end on the day i requested so was all good but the stress made it a much less enjoyable_experience !
neutral	order was delivered quickly and all items were a good price , but one of the boxes was very torn and damaged and it was a gift . as the items were protected and sellotaped down with bubble_wrap it was obviously already damaged when wrapped , so a little disappointed but was too late to get another so i will have to explain it was damaged in transit .
neutral	been looking for white varnish for ages got some years_ago but had a job finding it again .
neutral	this is just what i wanted and the service was excellent would certainly recommend and i am not easily pleased cheers_guys
neutral	i ordered neutral energy_saving bulbs no .
neutral	cfl gx00 and received cool white energy_saving bulbs instead .
neutral	i rang the customer service over a week_ago and the person i spoke to said he would ring megaman to enquire if they had got the neutral bulbs .
neutral	i have not heard_anything since .
neutral	flowers were lovely but not worth the money . box arrived soaking_wet so a bit disappointed
neutral	the whole ordering process was straightforward and was pleased with sample service , however one of my sample selections was out of stock & i never received it .
neutral	i was looking at roller_blind fabrics but was also sent 0 samples of venetian_blind selections as well ?!
neutral	i ordered a blind from one of the samples i did receive and that was quite a simple & intuitive process but i do not remember being given the option of reverse roll which i only thought about when the blind arrived and would have been my preference .
neutral	communication was good after my order and it arrived in a timely_fashion , well_packaged .
neutral	i was pleased with the quality of the blind but it has completely_different fixings & ends to all my other blinds and has taken me 0 hours to get it fitted as i could not use the brackets from my old blind or use the same drilled_holes which i have done in the past & was also able to do with one i ordered for my bathroom from a different company .
neutral	that has given me cause to downgrade my rating but if others are aware of this then you will find the quality and service very good generally .
neutral	mother '_s day gift for an 00 year_old .
neutral	delivery instructions selected was " please be patient " but doorbell_rang and flowers left on doorstep without_any patience shown at all .
neutral	a lot of greenery in bouquet and some flower '_s stems too short for standard vase .
neutral	disappointing !
neutral	i ordered 0 x 00 pc thank_you cards .
neutral	one of 00 pc without gloss coating , it is not up to my expectation .
neutral	i have ordered my dog_food twice from viovet now and both_times it has arrived very quickly but a few of the pouches and tins have been damaged and they have had to be thrown_away .
neutral	0 pouches were ripped and 0 tin lids were crushed .
neutral	as the tins were quite_expensive , this negates the lower viovet price .
neutral	have used the service before and been happy but this time delivery seemed to take_forever .
neutral	then we discovered that the courier had just tossed the item over the garden_gate - had clearly made no effort to knock on the door and had not left us any card to say what he '_d done .
neutral	luckily there was nothing breakable inside but the parcel sat out in the wet overnight because we didn_'_t know it was there
neutral	the customer service and speed of delivery were both 0 - star .
neutral	but what was disappointing was that the rug was quite a bit darker_than appeared in the photo .
neutral	since i used the rug for 0_days and it has some pet hair on it , i have not asked to return it .
neutral	had it been the cheery , bright_red in the photo , it would be on my floor , but instead it is in my closet and will go to a charity_shop .
neutral	bought mothers_day flowers , spent 00 on a bouquet which turned_out to be smaller_than_expected .
neutral	good arrangement though .
neutral	thought paying 0 . 00 for mothers_day delivery was acceptable .
neutral	estimated time of delivery would have been nice , was only by sheer_chance my mum was in when they were delivered .
neutral	would use the service again , but probably only on a special_occasion where getting to a local_florist was a challenge .
neutral	quality good .
neutral	i was so pleased with the book when i first opened it .
neutral	i still love it , only_thing is , there are 0 photos in it that have been spoilt .
neutral	not sure if the ink has ran or something but one person looks like they have blue lips , the other one someone has a blue spot_on their nose .
neutral	other than this it is a good book
neutral	on 0 occasions i have written reviews for different restaurants which have not been printed .
neutral	these were i think 0 - 0_stars based on my thoughts of the quality of the food and environs .
neutral	based on that there must be other_peoples reviews that are also not printed thus not reflecting a fair response to eating out .
neutral	i like to praise as well as criticise but find that most people are more negative than positive about their experiences which unfortunately can damage small_businesses .
neutral	having ordered the arrangement from the website specifically for the choice of large blooms and the balance of colours , the flowers sent did not match the picture .
neutral	allowing for the substitution clause , i would still expect the same use of large blooms and emphasis on the chosen main colour but the arrangement was not the same .
neutral	yes , it was an arrangement of fresh flowers and was delivered on time , but it was not what i ordered !
neutral	it would be nice if this company had addressed me properly instead of referring to me as mrs ' firstname '.
neutral	this is down to basic admin !
neutral	this company lost my order but didn_'_t realise they had lost it until i asked where my goods were .
neutral	goodness_knows whether they had taken my payment .
neutral	however when they realised their mistake they put things right straight_away and refunded the postage as a gesture of goodwill .
neutral	i bought a gourmet knife_block via_amazon & didn_'_t realize it came with a carving set which i already have .
neutral	i requested an exchange & was instructed to return the carving set ( at my own cost ) & buy the knives i wanted with the refund .
neutral	i did as instructed & via procook direct as they were offering free_p_&_p .
neutral	two_sets of knives then arrived & no refund , one from amazon & one procook , one as requested & one different ( not sure which way round ).
neutral	to pay 0x £ 0 . 00 to get the correct £_00 worth of knives seems nuts .
neutral	then again 00_%_off the actual set & the ability to change the unwanted_items is a plus & the customer service has_been speedy & friendly .
neutral	these jeggings are nice and stretchy not bad quality for the money but they are just too short and will be or anyone over 0 ' 0 " ok if younwanbo tuck into boots but not if you want to wear with heels or flats as they are literally halfway up my ankle .
neutral	why don_'_t manufacturers make htm longer then at_least they cn be turned_up for shorter people but i cannot add any on to the bottom .
neutral	disappointed as apart_from that they are fine .
neutral	designed badges on line , choosing design and colours etc .
neutral	thought i would receive a work of art ....
neutral	the badges were lovely but the colours have turned_out very dark :( almost unreadable .
neutral	someone must have noticed this ?
neutral	a phone_call to explain the situation would have been appreciated .
neutral	good service , easy to use and simple !
neutral	did find that it seem to take hours to update on the status of the parcel , which is not so good .
neutral	overall i would this service again tho .
neutral	i found the site / service given by skypark_secure excellent .
neutral	only issue is booking charge which is not visible on page .
neutral	by the time i had chosen my supplier , i found that booking charge made this slightly more_expensive than other search_engine i viewed but i carried on as i couldn_'_t be bothered starting all over again .
neutral	would have preferred to have this pointed_out initially .
neutral	your website is rather difficult to navigate because of pale print in a very tiny point size but i had a very helpful email from a member of your staff by return of mow request for help .
neutral	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
neutral	the service team couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
neutral	courteous , clear in instructions .
neutral	however when i booked the suzuki ( or equivalent ), we were extremely disappointed in the gutless toyota that we got .
neutral	having driven a suzuki before , any vehicle equivalent would have been ok .
neutral	the toyota was far below the quality that we were expecting .
neutral	the car was in the same condition i dropped it off - phew !
neutral	i have never had to wait for the car to be returned with other meet and greet services .
neutral	i find that whilst the products are good at a competitive price and well_packaged they fall_short on effective communications .
neutral	eg .
neutral	one email will tell me that a product is no_longer available and then another a few_days_later will advise me on a delay of the product saying it will be sent when available .
neutral	i then say i am no_longer requiring this product but i keep getting emails_advising me about the delay .
neutral	i think someone should read emails from customers and answer them and not just ignore them .
neutral	all in all though it is a good competitive site to buy from .
neutral	i used your online facility for the first time .
neutral	i usually look online to see what your current prices are and then contact my local_store to agree the items and deal with danny directly who is great .
neutral	unfortunately danny said i '_d need to do the whole_transaction online .
neutral	although it went fairly smoothly i prefer personal contact , but it doesnt make business sense to pay a different price to online .
neutral	the online prices should also be available in store - or not available !
neutral	a very good quality product supplied fast however the guy manning the phones at the bury branch let the company down .
neutral	i phoned to ask if they supplied rings with the shower pole to be told " shower poles , we don_'_t sell shower poles we are bathstore " i then panicked thinking i had in fact bought from a fake store !!!!!
neutral	i then explained i had got the phone number from the same website !!
neutral	train your staff !
neutral	the flowers were lovely - delivered on time but they were dead after a week which was a little dissapointing
neutral	sent out to me another_batch of tablets quik post to me , just got in time before my others ran_out , many_thanks mr k a ward stevenage .
neutral	c fry
neutral	last december we ordered springsteen tickets for the june 00st concert at the stadium of light , we chose 0 tickets @ £_00 . 00 add on booking and delivery fee plus_vat and the total charge came to £_000 . 00 fair_enough !
neutral	we were very happy with the online service from viagogo but when our tickets arrived they were clearly_marked at £_00 .
neutral	this is clearly a rip_off i have tried to ring the customer service number on the event information email , this number according to recorded_message no_longer exists .
neutral	i will be writing to viagogo in the hope of getting a refund of the price difference .
neutral	otherwise great .
neutral	our sofa was damaged on delivery we called dfs and had to wait two_weeks for repair parts were missing and as we spent 0 grand i expected a lot better
neutral	the price was good but the quality was lacking so i will not be purchasing anymore cartridges from you
neutral	when i phoned them they were fine and helpful .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that the flowers arrived quite late and had been left on the porch , although i had stated that the driver should be patient .
neutral	the recipient was happy with the flowers , but i was disappointed as to the service .
neutral	overall though , i think i may use them again .
neutral	transaction_id_:_0000000
neutral	a few hours ago , i purchased two tickets for the kanye west show at hammersmith apollo this sunday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
neutral	after_reading_reviews for viagogo on various_websites , i am now close to tears at what seems to be the inevitable prospect of losing a couple of hundred_quid .
neutral	i wish i hadn_'_t purchased them in the first place .
neutral	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
neutral	however , i '_m now extremely doubtful this will happen .
neutral	i '_ve already emailed about this and received a phone_call and assurance from you so the issue has_been resolved but the courier you use was not great !
neutral	i already sent an_email about this and haven_'_t had a reply .
neutral	thank_you for my delivery .
neutral	the service is amazing and the product was as_described and i am very happy with it however , i was very surprised that the marc_jacobs box it came in was badly_damaged .
neutral	had i known the box was damaged then i could have made the decision whether i wanted to proceed or not , but i wasn_'_t given that information / option .
neutral	had i bought this as a present i would nothave been able to give it - so that is disappointing .
neutral	otherwise service is good , but i will be wary of ordering from you again .
neutral	animal_direct was really brilliant - however their chosen transport for delivery leaves a lot to be desired - i tracked my consignment and was lied to three_times , i wasted a huge_amount of time waiting in for delivery - i had said it was an_urgent item that i was ordering and i paid_extra for the quick delivery service , so i cannot say that i was pleased .
neutral	i think you ought to check your delivery service and find a better one or your reputation will be harmed !
neutral	i also think having to sign for deliveries puts people off buying on line .
neutral	we all have a safe_place to leave products if we are asked .
neutral	julie tassell
neutral	lots of choice , what an attractive website !
neutral	but the same cannot be said for the products !
neutral	postage - outstandingly fast !
neutral	scarlet o ' hara - the costume is simply not like the picture enough !
neutral	dorothy - i '_ve now recieved two costumes ( thank_you katy for replacing the 0st so quickly !)
neutral	and both have been poorly made with stitching errors and holes !
neutral	i only hope the 0rd arrived before world_book day on thursday ?!
neutral	?
neutral	from a promising start ( great websites , incredibly fast postage ), to a disappointing experience ( the real positive about this company is the staff !
neutral	katy - incredibly helpful and understanding )!
neutral	such a shame ...
neutral	it '_s hard to find quality websites ...
neutral	a little dissapointed that the silver corrugated pillow boxes , where not of the same quality as the sample gold one or the colour_swatch which i had ordered from .
neutral	i feel it was quite_expensive having to pay for samples especially as they did not really refelct the quality of the boxes i recieved .
neutral	the cardboard was thinner , and some of them had to be forced open where the glue had caught .
neutral	several did not meet where they had been glued_together .
neutral	due to sortage of time i could not return them which i probably would have done .
neutral	they where for presenting ladies gifts at a charity dinner .
neutral	all in all for the price i suppose i got what i paid for , something a little cheap looking .
neutral	i received my order on time however you sent me the wrong costume .
neutral	on my invoice it states children '_s large headless_horseman and you sent me an adults large costume .
neutral	my son was really upset as he was really looking_forward to wearing this costume to his halloween_party .
neutral	i had to find an_alternative outfit for him .
neutral	his party has passed so too late for a replacement so i will be returning this one back to you .
neutral	i have tried to call you on numerous_occasions and it is continually engaged which too i am annoyed with .
neutral	i know you have email but i wanted to talk to customer_services personally .
neutral	i know this probably was a genuine mistake but you really should make_sure your customers are receiving what they had asked for .
neutral	some great offers , wide_variety .
neutral	down_side delivery on the slow side , puts me off ordering again .
neutral	i thought the ordering process was brilliant .
neutral	i had been let_down by another flower company who didnt deliver flowers to my friend who had just come out of intensive care .
neutral	so turned to senrenata flower '_s .
neutral	i ordered late on thursday_night and flowers were delivered ( free ) on the friday .
neutral	i was given updates on my order via_email and text and told when they reached my friend .
neutral	unfortunately both my friend and i were disappointed by the quality of flowers as they turned_up half_dead and floppy .
neutral	she hasn_'_t had them a week yet and they are set for the bin soon .
neutral	jeg_var imponeret med sms og mail anmelding at pakken_var ankommet , og mulighed for at bruge sms ' en til afhentning .
neutral	men selv pakken_var i meget dårlig stand , det_var heldigt at intet indhold blev tabt .
neutral	fits toothbrush but button hard to turn on and not as firm as original heads .
neutral	would not buy again .
neutral	good service although from this supplier .
neutral	i was very happy with the product .
neutral	we ordered a large banner and it was beautiful quality and looked excellent .
neutral	we are getting_married and we are in need of good decorations .
neutral	however , a major_issue developed with regard to delivery .
neutral	i specified twice on the website that the item must not be delivered to our neighbours .
neutral	the message was evident on the package also .
neutral	despite this the order was delivered to our neighbour with whom we have a strained relationship .
neutral	it took several weeks to get the item and despite our satisfaction with the product we cannot use partyrama again because we cannot_afford any more risks with our_wedding decorations .
neutral	such a pity .
neutral	delivery drivers were great .
neutral	they helped my mum with another delivery that arrived and was just left so thank_you .
neutral	dresser that we had delivered had two faulty doors that would not close .
neutral	the dvd cabinet has a door that rubs but does close .
neutral	also requested an extra handle from the sales_representative .
neutral	he said he would let_me know .
neutral	well as i didn_'_t get one i '_m guessing this is not possible but would have been nice to have been advised .
neutral	fantastic furniture on the whole but just a little attention to detail needed .
neutral	i know we could arrange for collection etc but you have to keep the boxes for return and they are so big you can '_t get the furniture out of them and keep them in one piece .
neutral	good service , good price apart_from outrageous £ 0 . 00 charge for credit_card use .
neutral	why did i use a credit_card ?
neutral	not enough funds in bank a /_c and needed oil while price lower .
neutral	won_'_t use again unless paying by debit_card .
neutral	when i turned the box around i could hear all the bits inside , i was dreading what i would find inside , the packaging looked great , well secure so i was really disappointed that many of the cigarillos had bits that crumbled off them , there were about 00 that were broken , which isn_'_t too bad out of 000 , but lots of them had bits crumbled off 😟
neutral	i was very pleased with how easy and quick it was to order on line then collect in store .
neutral	however when i opened the package to check the contents the t shirt i had ordered was badly crumpled and creased !
neutral	it looked as though it had been screwed_up at the bottom of the washing basket for days - and it had no tag !
neutral	as i was buying this as a gift i was not really v impressed !
neutral	the beam bags are great , good quality and value for money .
neutral	but delivery is a mess .
neutral	i have just odered refills for orginal bean_bags .
neutral	i '_ve had contradictory emails and text about delivery .
neutral	waited in until_0pm yesterday expecting delivery .
neutral	got a phone_call at 0 to say my order will be delivered the next_day ( today ) this morning , sure enough i get a text saying it will delivered between 00 and 00 this morning .
neutral	during that time period i get an_email_saying the delivery will be the tomorrow .
neutral	this is shortly followed_by a text saying the same thing .
neutral	the delivery did not happen between 00 and 00 as promised .
neutral	so i '_ve stayed in for almost 0 . 0_days waiting for expected delivery .
neutral	will it arrive tomorrow ?
neutral	i have no idea ....
neutral	serious flaw in the service , people can '_t afford to keep waiting in for deliveries that don_'_t happen .
neutral	i
neutral	pleased with the finished_product , it took a while designing as it wasn_'_t as simple as i would have liked and we didn_'_t use the design we originally wanted as we couldn_'_t get our picture to fit properly ..
neutral	prompt delivery but we were ten envelopes short with the invites and as we needed to send out asap we had to go out and buy some , which was a disappointment .
neutral	i am extremely happy with the rug - it looks great in my living_room and is exactly as i ordered it , so there are no_complaints .
neutral	the only_reason for the 0 - stars was that parceforce took over a week to deliver the rug , despite it being on a " parcelforce 00 " delivery - i had to call around to parcelforce a few_times to track it , as there was no information on the online tracker .
neutral	other than that , it was a great service at a fantastic price .
neutral	very effective ordering and delivery but expected more flowers in bouquet .
neutral	my daughter '_s 00st_birthday was while she was studying_abroad and i really wanted her to know i was thinking of her on that special day ... how to get flowers to her in london though ?
neutral	eflorist made it very easy to do and wasn_'_t outrageously expensive .
neutral	they got to her late in the day , so she didn_'_t get them until the next_morning ... that was the only glitch .
neutral	the flowers were delivered to the wrong house !
neutral	but the flowers and the note_inside were much_appreciated .
neutral	unfortunately we were sent a dodgy mis matched blackboard along with three normal / new ones because the warehouse was out of stock - bit of a poor show ?
neutral	the order came as promised but took a week to come .
neutral	other things i ordered on the same day arrived within 0_days .
neutral	i ordered flowers online that all seemed to go ok , i got a delivery number etc by text and email .
neutral	the next time i checked my emails there were two saying that they believed i tried to purchase flowers and there may have been a technical problem and i could also get 00_%_off .
neutral	i contacted customer_services who confirmed my order had been recieved so i dont_know what that was all about .
neutral	the lady got her flowers and was pleased with them which was what was important at the end of the day
neutral	id_0000000
neutral	i can not understand how it seems to take so long for the tickets to be dispatched .
neutral	as i know these tickets have been released and people on ebay seem to have them in there hands already .
neutral	i would prefer some update on my order states as the website is crap at this even the track your order page !!
neutral	as reading the reviews below its not looking promising
neutral	to your reply 0_days before the event is taking the mick as i know the person selling the tickets will already have them in they were released months_ago how do i know to trust the person_who is selling the tickets , have you not noticed the other reviews you have here stating that people have had problems with getting tickets in the past i do not see many happy customer reviews
neutral	excellent service in shop furniture excellent .
neutral	good timing for delivery .
neutral	were told delivery men would deliver to a named room .
neutral	when furniture delivered the delivery men refused to deliver bedroom_furniture to the bedroom .
neutral	my husband and son had to take furniture up the stairs .
neutral	they managed fairly easily why could the men paid to do that job do it ?
neutral	got this fantastic six piece red knife_set but the acrylic stand was sadly missing guess that is why it was a wowcher deal eh !!
neutral	ha_ha
neutral	have been using pet_supermarket for a while now and not had any_problems until my last order .
neutral	for some reason our company name was not put onto the box so the delivery company were unable to deliver without speaking to us and rearranging .
neutral	instead of us receiving the food we ordered on the saturday , it was monday before it arrived .
neutral	not a major_issue , but one that meant we had to buy food elsewhere to cover the gap .
neutral	prices are not much_cheaper_than other_places to be honest .
neutral	probably wont order again .
neutral	they are ok reasonable_prices good delivery but customer service could be improved as complaints are the customers fault never theirs
neutral	before i say anything , i want to thank luke for his wonderful customer support , he was excellent .
neutral	my shopping_experience with bedkingdom was not a happy one , all down to delivery not turning_up when supposed to , then when i was given another date , they still didn_'_t deliver , two_days wasted waiting around for them .
neutral	i am pleased to say that the .
neutral	bunk_beds i ordered are now in the childrens room & look lovely .
neutral	i am sure bedkingdom are a good company , they just need reliable delivery company
neutral	delivery came when we had really bad rain .
neutral	goods were thrown over the back gate as it was locked .
neutral	just as well nothing was breakable .
neutral	parcel was deliverd at 0 . 00 card was left to say items over the gate by the time i came in from work at 0 clock the box was soaking and fell_apart so item and packaging just fell out .
neutral	i think on this occasion the driver could have knocked at a neighbours to leave the goods .
neutral	very disappointed this time as usually have no_problems .
neutral	cant_fault the ordering and delivery but as to whether the stuff is any good , i '_ve no idea .
neutral	skiing does nothing for me , but my son is hooked so this order is part of his christmas box .
neutral	i booked with alpharooms for a few_days in benidorm and all went well until i checked my bank and the payment was taken out twice i tried to contact them to no avai , l i email them and no reply , i sent several messages through my account which it tells you to do , no reply as yet and that was three_days ago i dont_know what to do wether to wait on them getting back to me or just get in touch with my bank
neutral	informed car pick_up point was at florence railway_station .
neutral	spent several hours walking round trying to find them .
neutral	eventually rang the company to be told it was a good half / three_quarters of a mile_away which we had to negotiate with heavy cases and inadequate directions .
neutral	when we finally arrived they presented us with a budget car .
neutral	we had paid_extra for a bigger car because there were 0 of us and 0 cases to go in the boot .
neutral	the car provided only held two .
neutral	when we complained we were informed that was all they had .
neutral	after remonstrating they did eventually provide us with a bigger car from another garage - however we had to wait a further hour for them to deliver it .
neutral	however everything else , once we had the car , went_smoothly and handover at other end was very easy and swift ( once we had managed to find an open petrol_station on a sunday to fill the car !).
neutral	we chose a different drop_off point from pick_up point and this option proved to be quite_pricey for the privilege .
neutral	efficient , quick service , products we '_ll packaged , but sharpness of picture reproduction disappointing
neutral	the blinds are a good quality & easy to install .
neutral	i bought the white ones & am disappointed that when pulled down they look beige which does not go with my room at all .
neutral	i ordered the product after_seeing an ad in womens fitness magazine .
neutral	however , unfortunately , my order was sent to the wrong_address and was lucky my neighbour was in to receive the product .
neutral	i double_checked if it was my error in inputting details originally but it wasn_'_t ... i had someone wait in all day to receive the order but it never arrived ... it went next door !
neutral	i telephoned to give feedback and received a verbal apology ...
neutral	ordered a costume large sizing to fit my entertainer but when it arrived the costume was all sized wrong the chest was tight and legs short and around bum area so tight so i had to return paying postage i explained that i thought the manufacturer had cut and sewed garment incorrectly for the large label regulations jokers said they had measured chest of return item and it would have fit a 00 " chest so then i queried did they manage to measurer legs etc they replied that all measurements had been done and since then the returned item i had sent back had been sold with no_problems with sizing and now they couldn_'_t measurer anymore of these costumes because they are out of stock which i think is particular strange maybe they have realised that the costume has_been cut and sewed incorrectly to manufacturers regulations for large measurements and removed from sale .
neutral	in the meantime i have had to order the plus size costume which is more money and is far to big but i have to sew in all places to fit my entertainer .
neutral	very disappointed because all my previous experience with this company have been excellent its a shame they just couldn_'_t refund the postage knowing i have bought the bigger_size and now i have to alter myself to fit the large measurement sizing all wrong !
neutral	i was really pleased with the offers that you had given me , but then once i had sent my phone '_s away one of the prices of the phones went down to £ 0 just because it didnt have a back .
neutral	i dont feel that was appropriate as the phones didnt work and were no good anyway .
neutral	if that hadnt of happened with the plastic back i would of been over the moon .
neutral	i bought a carseat - britax_kidfix ( isofix ) - looked a good price on the web , clear delivery policy , and a company based close to where i live ( fewer delivery miles ).
neutral	as i was changing internet service providers and was left without internet for two_days , i initially phoned them up to order the car_seat .
neutral	after explaining my situation and being put on hold , i was told that they couldn_'_t apply the 00_%_discount_code over the phone .
neutral	bit_annoying .
neutral	a few_days_later , i ordered online , but there was no option to insert a comment relating to delivery instructions , so you couldn_'_t specify a preferred day ( s ) or drop location .
neutral	this would be a useful feature for them to add in future .
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	yes , but only if the price was right .
neutral	waltons were friendly and helpful , but the actual supplier could only offer one delivery date , which wasn_'_t brilliant given that this was the first day of term and the shed was for a small pre_- school .
neutral	the shed was reasonably good value for money , but the instructions were a nightmare to understand and follow being written to cover about 00 different_models ( and i '_m very practical , have trained as an engineer and have put up several sheds before ).
neutral	the metal panels were well made , but the frame was not .
neutral	screws / bolts were of good quality , but very disappointed that anchoring fixings were not included having been assured by waltons that everything i needed was in the pack .
neutral	i am pleased with the items i purchased - but they arrived 00 days after ordering .
neutral	although there was a slight " issue " with getting a tracking_number on my shipment ( which was the method i paid for ), i wouldn_'_t say the service was bad , in fact , when i did receive word from one of the gentleman he was incredibly helpful and very pleasant .
neutral	if you choose the tracking_number option , you will need to request in_advance or right after you receive the shipping confirmation , unfortunately it can '_t be sent automatically .
neutral	i gave 0_stars simply for the fact that the skinz i ordered don_'_t exactly fit the current ipod_classic ( only purchased 0_weeks_ago ) as stated on the website .
neutral	the front skin covers part of the screen , mind you it '_s minimal , but if you ' re as anal as i am about that sort of thing , it '_s a little frustrating .
neutral	beyond that , i '_m very pleased with the quality of the skin , the designs are exactly as they appear on the site and give my ipod a unique look that i '_m very excited_about .
neutral	i would certainly recommend the site to others interested in such a look for their equipment , but just be aware of the slight non - conforming fit .
neutral	the people who operate the system are generally very good .
neutral	two major problems have arisen to stop this being such a good service - the new airport stipulated approach of customers leaving their cars on 0th_floor , is not as good as being dropped_off and picked_up outside_departures is one problem .
neutral	however , my biggest ' beef ,' is the fact that some customers do not call for the service as instructed on the way back .
neutral	if everyone called when they have picked_up their bags , the pick_up and drop_off people would be able to ensure that no one is kept waiting very long to collect or drop_off their cars .
neutral	on our return_journey , late at night with two small children , we had to wait about half an_hour to have our cars returned ( two families ).
neutral	meanwhile there were collect / drop_off drivers waiting for customers to pick_up their vehicles and this often took 00 to 00_minutes or more - we were watching this happen , so understood why our vehicles took so long to arrive .
neutral	so i would say to our fellow passengers - please adhere to the rules , and to the airport - how about allowing this system on the ground_floor - it takes_longer to drive up and down five floors for the car company drivers .
neutral	as another_reviewer has already noted , one drawback of using holidayautos is that you may end up with a car from goldcar .
neutral	this firm has a different way of operating , trying hard to push you into buying overpriced insurance ( for example , by telling you that roadside assistance , even for mechanical defects , will not be available if you don_'_t buy insurance for >€ 000_per week ).
neutral	they also ask you to bring back the car empty , and the price charged for fuel is above normal .
neutral	i have had only good experiences with holiday_autos , up to the time when i found that they had signed me up with goldcar .
neutral	a great selection of products but i do think that the delivery charge of £ 0 . 00 should allow a much speedier delivery .
neutral	i ordered on friday , product dispatched on monday and goods only arrived on thursday !
neutral	slower_than second class postage .
neutral	the lady_who took my details online and processed my application seemed a little off with me at times almost as though my inexperience when booking travel_insurance inconvenienced her in some way .
neutral	other than that she took care of my insurance_policy and explained_everything that was involved with taking out this policy .
neutral	i would use them again for insurance in the future .
neutral	i was a bit dissapointed with the qulaity of the plants when they arrived looked 0 / 0 dead , but then i did order at a very cheep price so maybe thats to be expected .
neutral	however after a bit of t & c they turned_out ok in th end .
neutral	having had furniture from oak_furnitureland before , i had no_hesitation in ordering more .
neutral	and the quality of the furniture is excellent .
neutral	my only_complaint is the waiting time for delivery this time around , and i '_m still_waiting for my nest of tables that i still have no idea when they will be delivered .
neutral	shame as i didn_'_t wait this long previously .
neutral	the guitar was delivered on time , there were a few scratches and the box had been dented a lot , but as this was a present it wasn_'_t until some time after we had bought the guitar that we noticed the damage .
neutral	i have subsequently had to pay an additional £_00 to a local_dealer to have all the pick_ups and set_up altered as it was not playing at all well .
neutral	overall would have preferred to have given my £_000 to a local_independent store who could offer more care in the first_instance .
neutral	i purchased an intumescent letter flap ( code 000000 ).
neutral	instructions were vague and misleading .
neutral	instructed not to cut the intumescent strip but i had to in order to make it fit .
neutral	also needs intumescent mastic but none provided with this purchase .
neutral	no mention in instructions of the sleeves to take the through bolts which also have to be drilled for .
neutral	i will never ever use alpharooms again .
neutral	i think what they are doing is dishonest , deceitful and most_likely illegal .
neutral	( in my opinion )
neutral	i recently booked a hotel in chicago through them .
neutral	i booked through them because they were the cheapest .
neutral	to my cost i now know why .
neutral	nowhere when booking or even when i received my confirmation did it mention any where that there were extra taxes to be paid to the hotel .
neutral	every other booking site did including booking . com .
neutral	it quite clearly_stated after i paid the total amount requested that the total amount due to hotel was 0 .
neutral	when i queried this with alpharooms after being on hold for ages and ages , i was advised that the information on taxes was included on their agency terms and conditions .
neutral	nowhere on the area where you book , nowhere on your confirmation but hidden away on their website somewhere , the info was there .
neutral	because i booked it without cancellation clause , i could not even cancel .
neutral	after surviving cancer for the third time , this was my reward blow out holiday to myself .
neutral	it has_been ruined , totally by this who experience .
neutral	i think it is very underhand the way they lure you in saying they are the best price but this price is not actually the price at all .
neutral	defo will never book with them again .
neutral	ever .
neutral	for the country '_s national airline it does nothing to promote malta which is wonderful .
neutral	you are wedged into the aircraft with very little leg_room , not sure what the seat pitch is but it cannot be more than 00 inches if that , the food is awful but served with a big_smile , we were made to go to the back of the plane to use the toilet on a full flight as they kept the front toilet for business class passengers all 0 of them !
neutral	worst flight ever but not cheap , will probably never fly with them again .
neutral	not a good first_impression of malta .
neutral	please try harder
neutral	booked for myself and husband , could not fault the way the transaction was carried_out but really shocked with the cost of the tickets , face value of tickets £_00 each paid in total £_000 .
neutral	liked it , good service
neutral	although some of the instructions for placing an order were a little_unclear , the service was efficient and good value for money .
neutral	i was pleased with the quality of the wedding_invitations i ordered and delighted that i also got some complimentary thank_you cards .
neutral	i had to ring the company but the lady on the telephone was exceedingly helpful .
neutral	i was promised a jeep grand cherokee , instead i got a jepp liberty , which category wise , has nothing to do with it .
neutral	its like if you are to buy a toyota_camry and instead you end up getting a corola .
neutral	i guess that '_s their strategy to attract customers .
neutral	the flowers were gorgeous , really stunning .
neutral	but sadly i find it very disappointing when i ask for a delivery between five hours and it '_s missed completely !!
neutral	surely it '_s not that hard to get them to the address between the space of five hours i '_ve asked for .
neutral	if i knew it was going to be that difficult for them then i would have gone somewhere_else .
neutral	will not be using the company again .
neutral	i have used before and they have been quite good however this time i left strict_instructions as the person receiving the flowers was an older lady_who cannot answer the door quickly .
neutral	because the didn_'_t get an answer they left the flowers at the back of the house which was worrying for me because the lady does not go out to the back of her house .
neutral	i was worried that she would not get them and so had to ring which was unfortunate because i wanted them to be a surprise .
neutral	received my purchase on the day complete_care told me but with a massive hole in the box so can '_t be sure if anything has fallen out .
neutral	luckily what i ordered was in the box but not sure if any guarantees / spares or paperwork has_been lost .
neutral	up until then was quite happy with the service .
neutral	the gales blew down some trees in the woods .
neutral	so i needed nets to get privacy from footpath & neighbours .
neutral	bought a lovely voile panel , excellent spring_loaded pole and clever magnetic tie_backs .
neutral	took longer to arrive than hoped .
neutral	i would have been quicker popping down town .
neutral	not to worry bet they don_'_t have the tie back things .
neutral	i had too ring the office to get directions and the person was not one bit helpful , it sounded_like i was disturbing her , we had just got off the cablecar at royal victoria and she could not tell me where we would meet a bus to do the tour , wasted alot of time trying to find a stop ... maria
neutral	if ithe welly size is correct at 0 then all should be ok . get in touch later because this a xmas_gift .
neutral	noticed that real several new clients could not understand your pre_- booking and collection policy .
neutral	arguing with staff because there was extra money to be paid at the collection van .
neutral	very time_consuming and saw several disgruntled_customers , who obviously will go else where next time .
neutral	your booking form does not explain this very clearly .
neutral	as a previous customer we had no_problems but others certainly did !
neutral	needs more clarification .
neutral	i believed i could buy a return ticket ( london - lisbon ) in one single process but was frustrated by being told that some aspect of my journey could not be booked but with no information as to which / what .
neutral	was it the date , time of travel or my preference for an aisle seat ?
neutral	only after breaking the journey down into small , one - way hunks could i achieve what i wanted .
neutral	now i know that , the site is fine ( i think !
neutral	i '_ve not yet booked my return_journey .)
neutral	all interaction with better_bathrooms was efficient and prices are great but the delivery company used for the south_west were useless and rude .
neutral	i called to book my delivery it never arrived on the friday so i called to chase and they denied all knowledge even_though i had the guys name they said they '_d never spoken to me , he said he was the only one who answered the phone but after he hung_up on me mid call i called back and an equally rude_woman answered .
neutral	eventually got my delivery and pleased with the products but not the delivery company
neutral	i have used chemist_direct a number of times before and was very happy , however , this time i '_m not happy at all .
neutral	after_placing an order on sunday i was able to track the delivery via their chosen carriers web_site .
neutral	it never usually takes more than two_days , yet today , 0_days_later i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	my oder was for animal_feed for both dogs and my very precious rare_breed cavies .
neutral	i have no car and am registered_disabled so it '_s much_easier to order on line and have things delivered .
neutral	i ( checked on line to see that finally my order was on a van to be delivered on thursday , i waited in all day .
neutral	at 0 o ' clock i checked again as i was very concerned , to find that the order was back at their llanelli depot .
neutral	my animals have had to go without feed tonight and i am very , very unhappy !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i really will think_twice before using them again .... chemist_direct ... you are pretty good but your chosen carriers really do let the side down !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	took nearly a week to deliver and charged a fortune for the privilege .
neutral	but they did stock the correct_part where no one else did .
neutral	i had a voucher_code for 00_%_off but it would not let_me use it , i contacted customer_services but never even got a reply .
neutral	i find preloved easy to use , with a nice format .
neutral	but take care !
neutral	i bought a campervan from a regular user a dealer on preloved , and it was not as_described , quite the opposite .
neutral	the mot was not worth the paper it was on , and vosa failed the van on over 00 major points .
neutral	the guarantee was invalid and i was expected to pay a massively inflated amount for this warranty which would not have been valid if i had tried to use it due to a number of reasons .
neutral	the habitation check was not produced as promised .
neutral	it took me months to eventually take the dealer to court .
neutral	i won , but he still tried to wangle out of payment .
neutral	i got all my money back , and he narrowly escaped a judgement .
neutral	but i cannot warn anybody that these campervans could be dangerous in more than one way .
neutral	what would have killed me first the carbon_monoxide or the failing brakes ?
neutral	of course he will sell the van again and uses dodgy practices to sell these vans .
neutral	i don_'_t have any way of feeding back my negative experience about this dealer on the preloved site .
neutral	i ordered some flowers to be sent to a friend who had just lost their father .
neutral	they were a gorgeous sympathy boquet , and i was given updates as to when my order was recieved , when it was dispatched and when they had been delivered .
neutral	i then found out that the flowers hadn_'_t avctually been delivered and weren_'_t left with a neighbour .
neutral	they were left at the door in the rain and wind for 0 hours before they were found .
neutral	i would strongly_recommend that flowers are left with a neighbour or taken back and re - delivery is tried later .
neutral	especially when they were for such a sad and sensitive occassion .
neutral	i only drink coffee never tea .
neutral	so i purchased the nespresso it completed my life really .
neutral	i will never knock your coffees i just felt that they just didn_'_t quite satisfy that yummy feeling i get with nespresso_capsules and club .
neutral	nespresso collect the capsules back from you and as i didn_'_t have any means of recycling from you they went in the council plastic recycle bag .
neutral	they were ok but i will stick to nespresso for now .
neutral	it '_s rather like i couldn_'_t drink nescafe original .
neutral	gold blend every time .
neutral	i also would say that as i drink a lot of decaff , nespresso it is hard to please a decaff drinker every time .
neutral	very quick service and dispatch and nicely_packaged .
neutral	take no notice of me though .
neutral	i '_m just one .
neutral	my family liked them .
neutral	the flowers were for a birthday_gift and were beautiful , the recipient was very happy with them .
neutral	unfortunately we found them abandoned on the door_step !
neutral	the delivery address was a business address on a busy main_road , the driver just left them there .
neutral	i had stopped using hungry_house after such poor cusotmer service - a few_months latter they send my a 00_%_off voucher so i thought i '_d give them another chance .
neutral	stupid me - i placed an order which was ' being sent to restaurant ' for over 0 hour .
neutral	during this time i emailed hungry_house ( no reply ) and called the restaurant to cancel the order .
neutral	after almost 0 hours of no contact i emailed hungry_house again to chase my refund , by this time i had food delivered from elsewhere - no reply .
neutral	i received my card statement today to find i had been charged and not refunded by hungry_house for an order i cancelled and never received .
neutral	it may only be £ 0 . 00 but if they steal this from every customer they will be nice and rich soon !
neutral	i have emailed them again today - wont hold my breath till they respond !
neutral	00_minutes later * i should add that having read this forum i found out they have live_chat on facebook - maybe a good idea to advertise this on your site - the online operator apologized and assured me i will have a refund in 0_days , back to holding my breath ....*
neutral	have redeemed my first purchase through cashback .
neutral	still_awaiting 0 more payments which were 0_months_ago .
neutral	still_waiting for reply back from topcashback .
neutral	the reviews from other customers , added to the description of benefits and outcomes , encouraged me to make several first purchases .
neutral	however , several days_later and i '_m still_waiting for them to arrive .
neutral	we live in hope !
neutral	we bought some medical trousers which have not lasted and worn through the knees so we tea trying the red hawk trousers disappointing colour range for women means we have had to order mens ' versions , so far we have had to send some back for sizing and and another pair for a broken clasp - the refunds have come through quickly , but the returns have to be taken to a local shop which has awkward parking and is no - where on our normal errand runs - it would be easier to use the post_office !
neutral	got my flyers really quick which was lovely .
neutral	great size but the picture i used i paid £_000 for , it was a very good picture with amazing detail .
neutral	however printed on the flyers it really didn_'_t do any justice .
neutral	blurry and pixilated , still ok but i expected better quality :(
neutral	easy to use website , cheap , super_fast delivery .
neutral	brilliant service
neutral	only_flaw was my tights had a hole in them when recieved .
neutral	don_'_t do it .
neutral	i '_m on month 0 since having my eyes done and feel awful .
neutral	i have constantly tired eyes .
neutral	they get bloodshot and watery a lot .
neutral	i cannot see very well if there is light behind an object , am dazzled_by the glare off headlights etc and still see awful shadows around reflective surfaces .
neutral	i only had slightly bad_eyesight and my long vision , in daylight , has_improved ; but at what cost ???
neutral	would i have it done again ?
neutral	no .
neutral	however my husband , who had very bad_eyesight , is very happy with the procedure and he has none of the side_effects ( glare , shadows etc ) that i '_m experiencing .
neutral	my final comment , read all you can and make an educated decision before going ahead with this treatment .
neutral	i bought a twin_pack of ballycastle hot toddy from my local aldi and discovered that the ingredients are described as " a warming sweet hot toddy blended with smooth triple distilled irish whiskey infused with lemon and spice flavours ".
neutral	however as there is no list of ingredients i phoned aldi to ask whether there is added_sugar or honey .
neutral	( this is pretty important if you ' re diabetic !).
neutral	the customer adviser clearly thought this was a highly amusing question and informed me between giggles that she had no idea !
neutral	after putting my call on hold for a long time , she then said there was nobody available to provide the information .
neutral	she took my number and promised that someone would call me on monday .
neutral	i shall await the call with interest , but i do feel that the ingredients should be listed on the product in the first place .
neutral	easy to use and fast service .
neutral	glasses tend to arrive quicker_than from high_st optitions .
neutral	huge_amount of choice and lots of greats .
neutral	only issue is that without a fitting service the glasses are not the comfest to wear .
neutral	great as additional pairs of glasses that you might wear once a week but without a fitting service they are too uncomfortable to wear as your main frames .
neutral	one bottle from case of 00 from drinks_direct arrived broken ( from the bottom of the bottle ).
neutral	i let you know only to be asked by some jobsworth to send back the packing !
neutral	it was a big , cardboard_box , which we threw out when we emptied it .
neutral	the bottle only cost £ 0 , so i was hardly likely to defraud you .
neutral	but i thought you should know that there ought to be a double layer of packing at the bottom of the box to prevent this sort of thing happening .
neutral	slow process and still_haven_'_t got my cheque after 00 days !
neutral	the items were collected on the 00st_march and still havn_'_t had my cheque even_tho they did email me on the 00th_april saying it will be with me the next working day - that was a week_ago and no sign of it .
neutral	they also state there processing time is 00 days , it has_been 00 !
neutral	i have no emailed them asking if my cheque may of been lost and waiting for a reply
neutral	if they do finally pay up i will have no problem with the delay as i am in no rush for the money , but there website should state that the payment can take up to a month !
neutral	tesco give us value for money as long as you are on the alert when shopping .
neutral	in store prices seem to be confusing and as long as i have my glasses on i will find the bargins .
neutral	bigger is not always better value .
neutral	pay attention and you can get real bargins
neutral	i would use again as an excellent service - next_day delivery - but postage and packing at £ 0 . 00 for 0 to 0 uk delivery days , i found particularly expensive
neutral	the communication during the ordering process was quite good .
neutral	however , this is the second occasion i have ordered from you , and on both_occasions the item was out of stock .
neutral	in the most_recent order , this was particularly unfortunate , as i the animals were in kennels whilst i was away , and the kennels were particularly concerned_about the non - arrival of the medicine .
neutral	in the event , i was not contactable , being abroad , and the medicine turned_up on the last day before we returned .
neutral	excellent from_start to finish .
neutral	mum was very pleased to recieve these roses as she had just lost her sister .
neutral	unfortunately they have only lasted three_days which at the cost of them was dissapointed with them .
neutral	there service was very good , but hte quaily of the flowers did not rate as to how good the service was .
neutral	we have travelled with most passenger ferry operators but it is never easy getting to europe from scotland or the north of the uk .
neutral	dfds offers a good enough service and their prices are pretty_much the same as the rest .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why we are totally_ripped_off by the exorbitant prices on borad or food and drinks .
neutral	the overall standard of service is ok but nothing really stands_out .
neutral	they get you from point a to point b and if you have a calm crossing that is always a bonus .
neutral	the boats were very nice and the service throughout good albeit pricey .
neutral	at the end of the day they ferry you and your vehicle across the water and charge you the going rate .
neutral	one point to note though is the hanging_around time waiting to disembark at both_ends - rather too long !
neutral	the initial booking process was simple and easy until trying to add the card_details to make the payment .
neutral	no matter what i did i couldn_'_t get it to accept it .
neutral	i planned to try later .
neutral	approx 00_mins later a customer service agent called me to check if all was ok with the reservation , as it was still sitting in their pending files .
neutral	i explained my issue , she took the details over the phone and sent me my confirmations straight back .
neutral	what started out as a bit of a pain ended_up being fantastically well rescued by your customer service team .
neutral	very impressed ...
neutral	i '_ve said what i needed , this box is superfluos ..
neutral	ordered from fine_coffee_club for my new krups coffee_machine which recommends nespresso_capsules which unfortunately are very expensive .
neutral	although they are half the price of nespresso_coffee and they came within 0_days of ordering , i am afraid i was disappointed in the quality .
neutral	i feel they do not have the same taste or flavour of the nespresso_capsules .
neutral	i ordered 000 so will use them up but not sure if i will reorder .
neutral	my husband thinks that they are ok .
neutral	the price was good this time had 0 discounts but it took a week to come .
neutral	last order only took 0_days .
neutral	my dogs were getting very low on food by then .
neutral	was i spoilt by the first quicker delivery ?
neutral	?
neutral	loved the invites , great quality but i ended_up having to scrap the first set and order further copies as they had 0000 as the year instead of 0000 in 0 separate places .
neutral	i have presumed the way the process works , it must have been my erorr albeit i can '_t for the life of me see how i mistyped the date on 0 occasions .
neutral	only wish there was a quality check in place with a call to me to query the date before printing .
neutral	who on earth would send a christening invite out a year in_advance ?
neutral	graet price , little dissappointed on the delivery time but no other complaints ,
neutral	i ordered some sample pots of paint to be picked_up from store .
neutral	after a couple of days i rang the store as i had not received any confirmation or despatch emails .
neutral	they were already in - don_'_t know what happened with the system - but as i got a request for feedback i assume my email address was correct .
neutral	i have orderd before and never had a problem - so assume it was just a gremlin .
neutral	but advice - keep a record of your on screen confirmation when you order just in case .
neutral	i ordered james_wellbeloved senior / light cat_food , it was invoiced as senior / light but when it came it was only senior .
neutral	this i could have got locally !!
neutral	it took 0 week to arrive and i had to get some extra food to see me on .
neutral	i was wanting 0 / 0_kg packs , sso bought 0_kg until supplies arrives
neutral	since i had returned senior food to another on - line company who also advertised foos as senior / light but sent senior i was rather disappointed to say the least to get just senior food again !!
neutral	however due to needing the food i kept it .
neutral	i bought a quaich from the website and the size was detailed incorrectly .
neutral	i have ended_up with a tiny quaich which i could not return as it was engraved .
neutral	when i called to let you know , i was told the dimensions were for the box .
neutral	when i checked ths size of the box , this didn_'_t match either .
neutral	i suggest the website sizes are checked and amended .
neutral	so slightly diappointed .
neutral	flowers good , when i went to make final payment i had clicked to pay and for unknown_reason i had bought a butterfly card , i had ticked free card , sent 0 emails no response . want the £ 0 . 00 . refunded , as not what i wanted .
neutral	the flowers weren_'_t as expected or as nicely_presented as on the website but for the price paid was just acceptable .
neutral	the gift_tag that came with the flowers was barely noticeable and wasn_'_t nicely_presented i think an individual card should be sent that isn_'_t a piece of paper generated off a computer that looks like it '_s an information_leaflet to be disposed of .
neutral	initially , the wrong_size was sent .
neutral	however after_contacting , lesley at customer_services , the problem was sorted_out fairly easily .
neutral	next time i would order by phone and not online as online it showed stock was available when it wasn_'_t .
neutral	a parcel did arrive but it wasnt mine so i rang your office and it was arranged for the parcel to be picked_up and my parcel was to be picked_up from the lady in london that it went by mistake that was on friday so i would expect to recieve my parcel sometime this week
neutral	i like that they deliver quickly .
neutral	i always have my package within 0_days
neutral	i think that although this diet is helping_me stay on track when it comes to caloric intake , the food is severely lacking .
neutral	the breakfasts are fine - the porridge and cereals are good , the lunches are fine but there is hardly_any meat in the soups at all and the dinners are quite tasty but seem to have hardly_any meat in them ( and they are generally meat based curries / stews ) and out of the ' meat ' that is in them 00_% of it is either grissle or fat that i actually need to spit out !
neutral	sorry for the graphic detail but it really could be higher quality when it comes to the meat used in the dinners .
neutral	the first pair of glasses arrived about one week after my order , however once they arrived i receieved an_email to say my second_pair were out of stock .
neutral	i decided to wait for them to be restocked as this was the pair i really wanted .
neutral	they arrived about three_weeks after the order date .
neutral	the quality of the glasses seems ok although i ordered both_pairs as prescription sun_glasses and i am very dissapointed with the darkness of the lenses , the fisrt pair are the grey_tint and are a mid grey and the second_pair are the brown transition_lenses which go from clear to only a pale brown .
neutral	neither are as dark as most high_street sunglasses .
neutral	ok for the present british_weather but no good abroad as i find i am still squinting in bright_sunlight .
neutral	annoying as i will now need to buy a third darker pair !
neutral	collection was booked for after 0pm thurs yesterday , they arrived before that time a card was left .
neutral	i spoke to jay at homebase who said he had arranged for collection today friday , he said no time was booked it would be sometime during the day ... i booked a days leave to make_sure it was picked_up ok , well its 0pm and its still not been collected and i '_m unable to get through to homebase , i am not impressed i '_ve wasted a days leave waiting round the house for nothing ... leave days are precious when you work full time ... so when will it be collected ?
neutral	?
neutral	hi , i found the inability for your system to accept my credit_card exceptionally frustrating .
neutral	the approach of the person dealing_with me was inappropriate .
neutral	the credit_card issue is not my issue , which is how i was made to feel .
neutral	you almost lost my business .
neutral	i '_m not sure why the letter i was sent to check my address / identity couldn_'_t have been sent sooner .
neutral	it was a mess and handled badly .
neutral	however , had my credit_card not been a problem i would have been quite impressed .
neutral	liz marsden
neutral	while wiggle is reliable in an_emergency , its premium prices mean buyers are simply throwing money away ( and into the pockets of the investors who now control the firm ).
neutral	i like the chemist idea of ordering online , the only_thing with it i dont
neutral	like is they ask too many questions about what you are purchasing
neutral	i recently had to cancel and order for tick_treatment for my animals because i did not have there weights , i was able to get them elsewhere online no problem .
neutral	nothing to add as it says it all in the title .
neutral	good price but cannot wait a week for first_aid bits .
neutral	good prices but not so good on delivery etc .
neutral	had to contact 0 times to get my discount_code applied and there was a delay of over week in dispatch as they were out of stock on one item , but only found this out when i contacted them .
neutral	would have been better to learn this earlier and take the option of a sooner dispatch minus the item .
neutral	better communication would have given 0_stars .
neutral	bought two large blinds for front rooms .
neutral	smaller one is great .
neutral	larger one is heavy and bends down at ends due to weight , very difficult to pull blind up or down .
neutral	large blind sticks and goes squint often .
neutral	look great when down and drawn closed though .
neutral	the flower got on time but i asked and paid for a cristal base and they delivered them without a base .
neutral	that wasn_'_t very nice !!
neutral	!
neutral	prices rising , car delivered to airport gone up from £_00 to £_00 - how can that kind of increase be acceptable ?
neutral	?
neutral	less staff now all automated machines , less wage bill yet more cost to customer ?
neutral	?
neutral	did not get much for my phone due to it having a smashed screen .
neutral	i was happy with the easy postal process and received the cheque quickly .
neutral	couldn_'_t find these cheaper anywhere_else but waited a week for shipping then had to contact them to see where they were .
neutral	i had a quick response saying they would be shipped the next_day , not sure why they weren_'_t in the first place when they were in stock .
neutral	the software was easier to use than with other website companies but the product hasn_'_t arrived yet so i can '_t comment further on quality etc
neutral	although i had saved various designs , i couldn_'_t understand how to click on these previous designs and tweak the text .
neutral	they seemed to be set in stone .
neutral	i then had to regenerate the text i wanted which always started as the default for the invitation i was interested in .
neutral	this was a little_bit frustrating , especially as it was important for my family and i to think about the text and wait_until the next_day or so to actually place the order .
neutral	the sale process was just awful - the salesman kept making mistakes , overcharging me , then not really understanding the credit terms and conditions of the sale which_meant he got one wrong , and made false allegations that it was free credit when actually it is not , as there is a charge of £_00 or so on repayment .
neutral	it took 0 - 0 hours to get it all concluded , and when i ask for a small gesture , i was told i wasn_'_t entitled any .
neutral	to be honest , i was very close to just get a refund and cancel the order .
neutral	very poorly_trained salesperson .
neutral	once the sale had gone_through , i did get refunded for the overcharge within a few_weeks , which was good .
neutral	and i did receive the furniture i bought .
neutral	the other gripe i had was that it was supposed to be no_hassle , no flat_pack , which_meant my man was away ; however , the delivery was not ready mounted so i did have to get the neighbour to help just lifting the table in place and things like that , and having just moved to the area , it was really embarassing !
neutral	final gripe : when present , the instructions are just ridiculous , totally_useless - yes i kind of understood the table_legs go under the tables thanks , however there was no mention of the different bits ( washers ) included to actually screw the things in place !
neutral	i liked the helpdesk which i called though , they were very courteous and helpful to explain it all to me .
neutral	the products are amazing .
neutral	top quality .
neutral	the only_thing that i didnt like was recently i ordered a sporan for my father as he had just got a new kilt and he was invited to a big dance .
neutral	i had been waiting for over two_weeks for it so i phoned to see what the hold up was and that is when they told me about not having a specific part of it and they were waiting until they got it in before they sent it to me .
neutral	if they had emailed when i placed the order i wouldn_'_t have had to wait and get worried that is wasnt coming in time for my dad .
neutral	apart_from that it was good
neutral	i received the printer i ordered promptly , although a kind neighbour came to my door to inform_me that it had arrived there the day before .
neutral	i hadn_'_t met my neighbour before , so it was a good job she was honest , otherwise i may never have seen my printer !
neutral	the printer works_fine , and so far i haven_'_t had to sample the aftersales service .
neutral	delivery was excellent .
neutral	ordered late on monday and delivered before 0am on the wednesday .
neutral	box was a little damaged due the weight , 00kg , manufacturer needs to invest in stronger boxes as parts could easily have rolled around in the delivery van .
neutral	we were lucky , all parts were there .
neutral	i left my 00 , 00 and 00 year_old to assemble the frame and then my husband had to take over because parts kept_falling_down .
neutral	it didn_'_t take long to assemble the 00ft trampolin the main problem was keeping the legs up .
neutral	there are 0 poles that slot in but there are no screws which i was amazed_at .
neutral	it means that unless the trampoline is on 000_% flat ground at_least one of the poles lifts on the bounce of the trampoline and there is a real danger it could collapse .
neutral	also makes it almost_impossible to move for mowing the grass .
neutral	screws in the legs would have made the whole_thing much_sturdier and i had known this i would have paid more for something that has solid legs .
neutral	saying that we '_ve had it a week , had 0 fourteen year_olds on it and there have been zero problems and the price was much_cheaper_than the competiton .
neutral	the same size trampoline could easily have cost £_000 more on some websites .
neutral	so pleased with the product , children delighted but just wish i was happier with the legs and being_able to move the trampoline for mowing the grass without a real danger of it collapsing .
neutral	all went_smoothly .
neutral	we deliberately took the ' red_route ' bus so that we could benefit from a local guide who would hopefully educate and entertain us .
neutral	unfortunately , our guide spent the entire journey yawning , holding his head in his hands and generally behaving as if he wished he were at home in bed .
neutral	i have friends who have had great experiences with this company ; sadly , i think it very much depends on the luck of the draw as to which guide you get .
neutral	the trip down the river was great and the crew member who provided the commentary was everything we had wished for on the bus .
neutral	overall however , i don_'_t think our ticket was value for money and next time we will just take local transport .
neutral	was ok but there was only one option to go for .
neutral	luckily it was a reasonable_price and the job got completed after a delay in the collection .
neutral	the company used was very apologetic though although i had to phone them to find out why there was a delay .
neutral	would of given more stars but i orderd bow_ties and hankies for my wedding but unfortunately the colour was completely_different .
neutral	phoned up and they were very nice about it said to send them all back and they would try to match the colours .
neutral	so this is what i have done so we shall see
neutral	bought the battery for a mobile phone which had gone dead .
neutral	however did this in rather a hurry - nearly bought a new mobile phone till i realised what the problem was and googled mobile phone batteries and found allbatteries .
neutral	however should have stuck to amazon where i could have got the same thing but without paying the postage .
neutral	battery arrived in four days and is ok and does the job .
neutral	can not fault the quality of the items i ordered , but was a little annoyed at paying for delivery before half nine in the morning , and the goods not arriving for another hour .
neutral	delivery man was not the most friendliest .
neutral	there was a problem with the item i reserved - it all seemed fine , then they didn_'_t have it in stock , then they did ... other item was delivered a day later then expected but they did refund my delivery cost and overall i am pleased now i have the products
neutral	delivered on time and it was a big order i placed everything was there , which was great .
neutral	a bit too much bubble_wrap involved with all items being wrapped in this individually , maybe corn filled packing might be easier to unpack , saving on time from my end as well as packing end .
neutral	some of the packets of cereals were quite damaged , obviously what was inside was ok but a bit dissapointing , doesn_'_t look quite so nice a squashed ripped box sat on the breakfast table !
neutral	villa in need of updating , obvious damp on internal doorways , musty smell , there were broken plastic tables abanded in two courners of garden .
neutral	if you have small children the pool_fence is a must .
neutral	no ironing_board in villa .
neutral	villa in a lovely spot , ideal for beach and walking into_town .
neutral	good communication from the company , including estimated delivery date .
neutral	arrived bang in the middle of the estimated_date range .
neutral	packaging was very nice .
neutral	chocolates were very good quality , very tasty .
neutral	overall nice but not a lot for your money .
neutral	we visited london over christmas and bought a big_bus pass to see the sights and save the legs !
neutral	the london traffic was busy even then , which_meant it would have taken 0 hours to go round half the red loop to get from westminster to hamleys , so we walked instead .
neutral	that '_s one problem of the buses only going in one direction round the loop .
neutral	at one point we waited 00_mins for a bus , during which 0 original bus_tour buses went
neutral	past .
neutral	commentary not very thorough - mainly just music , which is pleasant , but not what i '_d paid for .
neutral	live_commentary on red_route good .
neutral	and boat_cruise excellent .
neutral	for the amount we used this , it wasn_'_t very good value .
neutral	haven_'_t even recieved my product yet so i can '_t quite comment on that , however it was an easy to use site and the despatching was quick ..... even_though i have got it yet !
neutral	they were meant to deliver it to me yesterday , i wasnt in so i text the number back who had text me saying deliver to neighbour , they text me back to confirm that this wasn_'_t a problem and they would deliver my parcel to my neighbour .
neutral	i come in from work to discover the slip of paper is laying on the floor at the bottom of my stairwell , they havent even put it through my door , so it seems like they havent even been to knock on my flat door to check that someone isnt in , thy clearly just rang my buzzer on the outside door , which sometimes can be tempremental so eveyone else just generally rings any buzzer till they get in the main door then comes and knocks on the flat door .
neutral	i then emailed the company to ask why is wasn_'_t delivered to a neighbour and i have heard_nothing back .
neutral	i have had previous problems with dpd ...... dont use them !!!
neutral	!
neutral	very impressed with serenata - had never_heard of them before and what i liked is that they kept informing_me as to the progress of the delivery .
neutral	the only fault is that i made a mistake with the delivery date ( birthday so i needed the flowers there on the correct date ) and serenata said i '_d left it too late , even_though it was hours before .
neutral	but anyway , i can see the pressure the company is under and i won_'_t lose any sleep over that .
neutral	i will be ordering from them again !!!
neutral	thanks so much ¸.•*¨*•♫· ٠ •●♥ ƹ ̵̡_ӝ ̵̨̄ ʒ
neutral	nice tiles , god value .
neutral	waiting in anticipation for the other two .
neutral	thanks

neutral	the photobook we received was really good but the 0st time i tried to upload the photos i got an_error_message and didn_'_t know if the order had been processed .
neutral	i tried again the next_day and only knew the order was processed when i got an e_- mail confirmation .
neutral	i love your site , and always buy from you .
neutral	but with the new laws i can not purchase perfumes form you any longer .
neutral	i know you have mentioned on the site that you trying to find a solution .
neutral	i have contacted your company regarding this matter to ask a few questions a week_ago , and still_waiting for an answer .
neutral	you used to be fantastic at service , what happened ?
neutral	kind_regards
neutral	jules demosthenous
neutral	the flowers were delivered when requested but were left with a neighbour who did not bring them over until the next_day .
neutral	it would be helfpful if you could put a note through the door to say where the flowers had been delivered .
neutral	the options where numerous for delivery i chose for them to be left with a neighbour this they failed to do and they were left on the doorstep for a night and a day , my sister in law wasn_'_t there until the next_day !
neutral	we ordered a hardback_photobook as well as a kitchen calendar .
neutral	the paper and cover used are very good quality and this makes the items look professional .
neutral	however , the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired as they have come out grainy even_though we used pictures taken on the raw setting on the dslr .
neutral	delivery was super quick and it was well_packaged .
neutral	a word of warning to new customers : once you have finished your design , you will be asked to register as part of the order process .
neutral	do check your inbox for your ' welcome ' email before submitting your order on the next page , as this contains money - off vouchers .
neutral	bought a bra , and only after paying was i informed they didn_'_t have it in stock .
neutral	disappointing having to wait so long for it , as i wouldn_'_t have ordered it if i '_d known it was out of stock
neutral	we ordered 00 / 00 / 00 and when we received the 0 lampshades one was covered on the outside with glue , we returned the lampshade and had to wait_till 00 / 00 / 00 for a replacement .
neutral	unless we emailed there was no explanation of when we would receive the replacement .
neutral	poor customer service .
neutral	i made an online purchase of a rug .
neutral	at point of order i was told that item was in stock .
neutral	i was due to collect the rug the following_day .
neutral	fortunately i was not going to collect until the afternoon , but at lunchtime i received a call to say that the rug was out of stock and a new delivery was expected on the following saturday and that someone would call to confirm that all was ok .
neutral	i was actually given a date for collection of the following_monday , a week from my initial order ( today ).
neutral	no call was received , so today i called homebase online number .
neutral	after waiting 00_mins for my call to be answered i eventually was given a collection date of this coming thursday .
neutral	question : why was i not informed online that stock was out and due on a certain_date ?
neutral	i would have continued with the order as it was 00_%_discount weekend .
neutral	why , if something is out of stock was my account debited on the original day of collection ?
neutral	surely not fair .
neutral	perhaps i should have waited to write this once my rug has_been safely collected !
neutral	happy with the product and price but delivery not good .
neutral	package did not arrive for 0 . 0_weeks .
neutral	maybe not their fault but can be a problem if wanted for a special_occasion , birthday etc .
neutral	i ordered some specialist rabbit_food following a trip to the vet and they suggested a particular dietary_food , available online from vet uk .
neutral	i have used vet uk before so i logged_into my account and ordered .
neutral	rather pleased at the £ 0 . 00 ' signed for ' delivery cost , i decided to order a couple of other items too from the super range of items on sale .
neutral	two_days_later i received an e_- mail saying that the the additional items were out of stock and they would be in at the end of the week , and the whole order would be despatched then .
neutral	concerned , i contacted them and said i needed the bunny food as soon as possible as i had a poorly bunny in need of it .
neutral	they asked me if i would like to cancel and refund the other products and just send the food .
neutral	i said yes , to cancel them and send the food only , or part - ship the food and send the other items separately when they were back in stock , whichever they thought was best .
neutral	they did not respond and only when i chased them later in the week and asked what was happening did i get an_automated despatched order e_- mail .
neutral	there was no personal response to two of my e_-_mails , and more_importantly , the parcel arrived a week after i placed the order , containing all the items - nothing was cancelled and my request had been ignored .
neutral	disappointing service and i will hesitate to order again , particularly if it '_s an_urgent medicinal item .
neutral	on a positive_note , the parcel was well_packed and dpd were super and delivered according to the hour time_slot that was e_- mailed to me ; for £ 0 . 00 this is great value .
neutral	the service from drinks_direct was great , my items were dispatched straight_away ( even_though i ’ d left my christmas shopping to the last_minute ) and the goods i received were excellent .
neutral	my folks were chuffed as they can ’_t find this wine they love in the shops .
neutral	i must_admit i was a bit_concerned that they wouldn ’_t be packed well enough for transit but there was really no need to be concerned .
neutral	it ’_s a shame i can ’_t say the same about the courier they use ( city_link )!
neutral	i was informed of my delivery day so i arranged to be in all day so that i didn_’_t miss the parcel only to check online at 0pm that apparently my goods were back at the depot due to a failed delivery attempt !
neutral	don_’_t think so !
neutral	i ’ d been keeping an eye out all day and nada , not even a missed parcel card !
neutral	since i was frustrated i sent a complaint to city_link ( via_e_- mail ) and i ’_m still_waiting for a response from them .
neutral	to my surprise it turned_up the next_day ( if i ’ d have had another so called missed parcel i would have blown a fuse as they try to deliver your item twice then you have to go and pick it up from the “ local ” depot which just so happens to be a fifty minute journey there and another fifty back ( and that ’_s if you have a car !)
neutral	so … overall i ’_m really happy with the goods but i have reservations_about using drinks_direct again purely_because of the city_link incident ( i know it ’_s not drinks_direct fault but this isn_’_t the first complaint on here about the courier and i ’_m_sure it won ’_t be the last !)
neutral	the bus_tour started off bad as we lost over half an_hour sat waiting on the bus and no one knew why ........ it turned_out it was because the audio system didn_'_t work and they were waiting for another bus to come .
neutral	by the time we got off the bus the replacement was full so we had to get on another bus .
neutral	the rest of the tour was good however when it was the end of the day the driver told us the wrong stop number it was finishing at therefore we had to get the underground to meet my son .
neutral	river_cruise was good and the crew were very jolly as was one of the bus comentators .
neutral	i was was initially pleased to find this site offering the items i was looking for at prices below the high_street and with free delivery .
neutral	i therefore added a few extras to my planned order .
neutral	however at checkout the vat is added , which pretty well wiped out the savings , though i completed the order as delivery was convenient .
neutral	there is no_indication on the product pages that prices are shown minus vat and as this is certainly not the norm in internet_shopping , it is clearly designed to mislead customers .
neutral	unless this changes i probably_won_'_t use the site again as i like to compare_prices like for like .
neutral	in its favour the ordering and delivery process was fast and efficient .
neutral	i havent_recieved my item yet still_waiting they say it has_been posted a few_days ago but not got it
neutral	i ordered a bed for my daughter and then took the day off work to accept delivery .
neutral	the day before i got a phone_call to say that the bed was out of stock and would be in within 0 - 00 days .
neutral	that eveing i got an_email to say that my bed would be delivered the next_day - as originially scheduled .
neutral	the next_morning i called to check and was told that my bed was actually out of stock and they would not have new stock for several weeks .
neutral	however , the girl i spoke to was very helpful and gave_me some alternatives that were in stock .
neutral	she then arranged for an_alternative bed to be delivered the next_day witout incurring the extra saturday delivery charge .
neutral	there flowers were lovely but the card , which i paid_extra for , was a mothers_day card instead of an i love you card as requested .
neutral	was unimpressed by that but they flowers were lovely .
neutral	when i made the booking it was a little_unclear as to whether the package would be collected and whether it needed to be dropped_off at a local collection_point .
neutral	also the estimated time of delivery to the final_destination was not accurate .
neutral	love the shoes but experience let_down by the length of time it took to deliver them .
neutral	private_transfers were a nightmare a nutter of a driver a clapped out bus no seat_belts i feared for my kids lives on this trip totally spoiled my holiday villa_plus put my kids lives at risk
neutral	i was very dissapointed to find out the extra driver that i had requested and presumed paid for , which stated on my receipt ( paid in full ) i was charged a futher 00 . 00_euros for extra driver and 00 . 00_euros for fuel when picking the car up talk about having you over a barrel .
neutral	.
neutral	the delivery was fine with good communication but the delivery people did not offer to unpack the item or take away the cardboard .
neutral	there was masses of it as well as polystyrene which we ended_up having to take to our local dump by car .
neutral	i think removal of packaging should be part of the service .
neutral	bookcase is lovely though .
neutral	the delivery service was generally fine with good communication .
neutral	however , the delivery men were reluctant to take the items ( flat_pack bedroom_furniture ) to the top floor bedroom .
neutral	we had to " persuade " them to do so
neutral	i '_ve shopped with whittard for many_years mostly buying
neutral	afternoon_tea , previously called pelham .
neutral	i buy this because it is a speciality product we have grown used to .
neutral	over the years this loose_tea has_become increasingly more difficult to buy .
neutral	now it is only sold in 000 gm packets .
neutral	for a customer who has_been used to ordering 0 kilos , this is not only an annoyance , but very expensive .
neutral	i have asked for feedback from whittards about this situation and recieved vague promises , but nothing has changed .......
neutral	the print quality of the photos was fine but the size was smaller_than the one i '_d asked for .
neutral	i found the software a little troublesome , with it crashing on me twice .
neutral	i was uploading 00 photos when it got stuck when i was about 00 in causing me to start all over again , searching for them from numerous different folders - so that was annoying .
neutral	good seevice , but the cheque took a while to come through .
neutral	had to chase this up .
neutral	overall ebookers was the easiest site to book flights with .
neutral	however after choosing ryanair as there flights where so cheap , it didn_'_t turn out that way .
neutral	the cost of transfers from dusseldorf to cologne hiked_up the cost considerably .
neutral	had i looked at the german company before booking i would have seen the train transfers where included and for peace of mind booked through them
neutral	we drove 00 miles one way to the selected garage ( thats the closest to us ) we had ordered four tyres .
neutral	they said they were only two , then they had only one , so we have to do another 00 mile journey on saturday when hopefully all the tyres will be in stock .
neutral	i found the ordering process misleading .
neutral	i thought i had ordered the 000gm size for dogs over 00kg for pennies less_than i had bought the treats elsewhere - so a good deal !
neutral	however what arrived was 000gm packs for dogs less_than 00kg for pennies less_than what i had previously paid for 000mg !
neutral	the process of returning the goods was going to be more complicated so i will keep the goods - but probably wont buy again .
neutral	the goods were dispatched immediately and arrived the day after ordering , and considering i live on an island , this was very quick service .
neutral	the jeans were nice and a good quality but the size was very odd .
neutral	they fit ok everywhere apart_from the waist so it makes them awkward to wear .
neutral	they also took a while to be delivered , considering the price you pay the shipping should be quicker .
neutral	not bad though , i love superdry '_s coats and tops but so far am not impressed with the jeans .
neutral	i ordered the cello_bags which i repeatedly order and they were fine but i added the mailing_bag to my order and was very disapointed with the quality .
neutral	they were so thin you could almost see the contents through them .
neutral	i called to ask to return them and had to pay for the postage of £_00 . 00 to send them back for a refund .
neutral	your website did not explain the mailing_bags sufficiently enough for me to realise they were very cheap quality .
neutral	great products , but the item was delivered the day after i was told it would be , which may be to do with the courier , not me kind .
neutral	it would have given me a lot more confidence in prestige_flowers if ; when you choose your bouquet and you are ready to order , the tick box for the boosted bouquet size wasn_'_t automatically ticked .
neutral	this is a sneaky marketing ploy to slip extra costs past the buyer and is a little underhand , especially when the cost is already premium .
neutral	having used chilli - sauce for my hen_weekend last_year with some minor_hiccups ; ( chilli - sauce didn_'_t confirm go karting numbers until last_minute even_though provisionally booked 0_months prior , so indoor go - karting became out - door as not enough karts at completely_different venue , * however they apologised and compensated ) i recommended them to a friend .
neutral	when my friend booked with chilli - sauce she specifically_requested the ibis hotel at explore lane bristol and we '_d stayed there on mine and loved how close it was to prism which was in our event .
neutral	however around 0_weeks prior we '_d discovered the ' rep ' had booked the ibis hotel at temple - meads .
neutral	the rep wouldn_'_t except responsibility and was adamant the hen didn_'_t request explore lane when we were all there that day and know she did .
neutral	we ended_up having to go to the travel_lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes_walk extra but the stress would '_ve been easily avoided if communication would '_ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
neutral	overall they did ' good '
neutral	i love the range of products but find the processing ( picking and packing ) of the orders a bit_slow ............ maybe i am too used to the amazon speed of processing
neutral	yes i know i could pay for faster delivery ..... but why should i ?
neutral	i do not understand_why it takes over 0_days to pick and pack something
neutral	it took nearly a week to receive delivery and the box was all bashed as the order had been sent in a jiffy_bag rather_than a box .
neutral	the game i ordered is a gift so i was not particularly happy
neutral	we found out late that a very good friend had had her operation brought forward so i found this website for ireland the headline on the website said order by 0pm for same day delivery
neutral	the order was done around 00 . 00 on saturday
neutral	the confirming email reached my email at 00 . 00 but was timed at 00 . 00 !
neutral	this is deception !...... and resulted_in a telephone_call saying that they could not deliver until monday
neutral	if they cannot deliver the website should be altered
neutral	i was livid ........ mondays delivery went to plan and apparently the flowers were " really lovely "
neutral	this is obviously a good service but the false_promises should be abolished !
neutral	we ordered this item and it was promptly delivered , however whilst construction was not difficult the instructions in a foreign_language did not help .
neutral	had to refer to the internet advert to see how some parts fitted .
neutral	also the water does not cut_off unless the whole item is placed on an extremely flat base - not always easy in a chicken run !
neutral	more information would have been useful .
neutral	i use e_- florist a few_times per year and previously my experience has_been fine .
neutral	however i recently ordered flowers for my mum and dad .
neutral	i specifically ordered springtime basket as it included daffodils and narcissi as these are my mother '_s favourite flowers .
neutral	unfortunately none of these were included .
neutral	i do understand that the website does states that " seasonal availability of certain individual flowers may_vary from those illustrated " but this is spring and daffodils and narcissi are spring flowers !
neutral	the flowers were beautiful and we were very pleased but they were dumped on our doorstep for anyone to steal which i thought was poor
neutral	what i found with your labels is they did not stick very well especially on school bags .
neutral	the name on the shoes stickers rubbed off as well .
neutral	however , the clothes stickers are fine .
neutral	oder is always despatched accurately and speedily - but since the move away from the royal_mail to a courier company i find it difficult to be at home to receive delivery - so my order seems to take longer to arrive than when royal_mail could just pop it through the letter_box .
neutral	i guess the tracking provided by the courier is useful if things go_wrong though .
neutral	not sure if my prescription was incorrect or if the glasses are incorrect or maybe i need trifocals !
neutral	- but my new bifocals while ok for reading up very close are too strong for me to read my laptop screen or car speedometer - which is really frustrating .
neutral	flowers arrived on the correct day as promised , however , i was really disappointed to find that the deluxe moonlight bouquet was little better_than you see on a garage_forecourt but at three or four times the price .
neutral	i will not use this service again and cannot recommend them
neutral	sent for these water_saving devices thinking i was doing my bit for saving the planet . starting with the 0 minute shower saver , which is just an egg timer and does not really cut it because ie , if you wash your hair in the shower it doesn_'_t give you enough time for rinsing and condition unless you stop the water in between which means you could end up scalded or worse . needs to be 0 minutes . the drop flush save is just confusing , nowhere on the website does it say can '_t be used with push_button toilets yet when received diagram only shows handle flush toilets , so i '_m confused .
neutral	overall not a great success , needs to be clearer on website and before ordering , just glad these are free and i didn_'_t waste money .
neutral	for the majority of times interparcel is great , however leading up to christmas they are obviously busy and i have experienced a lot of difficulty both with reliability and customer service .
neutral	very quick to order disapointed that have to pay delivery on pre_- orders but not on next_day delivery !!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!, will see when delivered if flowers are worthwhile , do hope so .
neutral	i have always been very pleased , and had good feedback from flowers received through serenata .
neutral	however , on this occasion i was a little disappointed , i ordered a christmas arrangement to be sent to a friend who had just had a heart_attack , paying £_00 . 00 , and seeing online thought it would be a reasonable size .
neutral	however , on visiting her was shocked and embarassed at how small the arrangement was .
neutral	serenata , i felt you let us down on this occasion .
neutral	i placed my order on 00 march_0000 .
neutral	when it hadn_'_t turned_up during the following week i rang to see when i could expect delivery .
neutral	i was informed that as i hadn_'_t paid the fee for first_class postage i could wait up to 0_weeks for delivery .
neutral	i wasn_'_t impressed by the call_handler '_s attitude .
neutral	the next week i ran again and spoke to a woman called jackie .
neutral	she told me that the parcel had been dispatched but could take up to 00 working_days for delivery .
neutral	i just mentioned that i could do with one of the items and jackie immediately arranged for a sample of the product to be sent out to me by first_class_post .
neutral	she ensured that i had enough to see me through to delivery .
neutral	i was appreciative of her manner and professionalism .
neutral	as it happened my order turned_up later that day and the samples came the next .
neutral	if the original operative had shown me the same consideration my comment above would have been excellent .
neutral	as it is the original call_handler let you down .
neutral	bought a duvet_cover and pillow_cases and love them ; great pattern , colours and material .
neutral	however when it was delivered we were not in and it was left with a neighbour , there was nothing put through our door to say they had tried to deliver and no details to say where it had been left .
neutral	i got an_email through to say it had been delivered successfully , i was obviously concerned as as far as i was concerned it hadn_'_t been delivered , i spent a long time chasing it .
neutral	i couldn_'_t get_hold of anyone on the number provided and i used the online form asking for someone to contact me , no - body ever got in touch .
neutral	luckily my neighbour finally brought the parcel round and i had to apologise and explain that i didn_'_t know it was with them !
neutral	product is fab , delivery not good !
neutral	ordered a mattress and they phoned to arrange a date for delivery .
neutral	both my partner and i work so we would have found it helpful to be able to arrange a certain day and time that one of us could be there .
neutral	in order to get the mattress delivered on a certain day we had to pay £_00 , however they could not specify what time it would be delivered and could only tell us on the day before whether it would be delivered in the morning or the afternoon .
neutral	they phoned my partner after 0pm on the monday to say it would be delivered on tuesday_morning - so even_though they were letting us know a time , he had still had to keep the whole day available as he didn_'_t find out about delivery until last_minute .
neutral	other than that it was delivered fine and we are very happy with the product .
neutral	would probably not pay for delivery again in the future as it didn_'_t seem to make the siutation any easier for us .
neutral	was very impressed how easy it was to order .
neutral	was also impressed with the tracking_information and delivery .
neutral	however was slightly_disappointed with my product .
neutral	the base had pot marks and a couple of groves .
neutral	my first time of dealing_with extera direct .
neutral	emailed them first then received a phone_call to place an order .
neutral	very good customer service but not happy about the delivery charge .
neutral	however received the mobile phone the following_day well before the deadline hour given .
neutral	will probably use them again .
neutral	very happy with service would reccomend
neutral	placed an order with garden best_buys .
neutral	over a week_later , i '_d had no communication from them ( apart_from a ' rate your experience ' email , ironically ).
neutral	i emailed to ask if my order had been dispatched , and when i might expect to receive it .
neutral	only then was i informed that the item was out of stock , and offered a refund .
neutral	in fairness , the customer service was good once i got in touch , and the refund was given immediately .
neutral	but the fact that the plant was out of stock , and i received no notification until i chased the order was disappointing .
neutral	my credit_card was charged_twice so i phone simply_supplements who disputed this so had to call my credit_card company and then write to them enclosing a copy of my credit_card statement , they then agreed to credit the overcharge .
neutral	this should have been sorted in one phone_call without all the hastle of having to call my credit_card company and then write to them .
neutral	i was lead to beleive that this was an excellent product from reviews . this was brought as a birthday_present and was put_together for a surprise by persons who have a good knowlege of garden_buildings . some of the structure were not true , no post that joins the handels together and skrews were to short .
neutral	the only problem was two christmas puddings containers cracked and seal was broken during shipment .
neutral	i ordered chess_pieces as a christmas gift for my husband but he knew about the delivery of said item before i did - the packaging had a regency_chess letterhead clearly_visible on the packaging .
neutral	this was unnecessary and totally_spoilt any surprise .
neutral	unimpressed .
neutral	the prices are sometimes cheaper_than elsewhere but can cause hassle , shipping times can be good or very poor .
neutral	i found that i couldn_'_t save items to my basket which was so annoying when i wanted to order something later , also i believe they don_'_t have a paypal option which causes hassle and made me feel unsafe .
neutral	the site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful .
neutral	especially with the new ' timeline ' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can '_t see in person a lot .
neutral	although the website is a little hard to navigate and the pictures are not the best quality the clothing and items are very nice when received .
neutral	my order was a little delayed however nothing major .
neutral	some of the sizing can come up a little weird ( ever when measured by their size_guide ) however the quality is good .
neutral	the item took a long time to be delivered despite saying on the website it would be delivered within 0 - 0_days .
neutral	i had to phone the company 0 or 0 times before i was informed when the despatch date would be .
neutral	i am enjoying my diet_chef dinner but having it at lunchtime .
neutral	i was surprised some didn_'_t come with rice ?
neutral	never fancy soup and the chicken cous_cous and lunch meals are awful .
neutral	which is a shame as i love my own chicken and cous_cous .
neutral	so , am struggling with the other meal .
neutral	i personally prefer to eat small meals other than the main_meal of the day .
neutral	i work long hours as a head teacher and would prefer the snacks with a touch of hummus or something like that .
neutral	i also like normally a cooked_breakfast ( a healthy one ) and to be honest at0am i don_'_t fancy porridge or shake but i did take to work the treacle and pecan muesli and had it with plain yogurt at 00 ish which was nice .
neutral	the soft chocolate_bar and fruit soft bar are yummy .
neutral	also , the popcorn is useful late night .
neutral	so in a nutshell - i wouldn_'_t buy diet_chef again after my two months because of the lunch choices .
neutral	ps i have given away all the 0 packets of chicken cous_cous i couldn_'_t eat .
neutral	hope this helps x
neutral	i must_say i would like a bit more flavour ...
neutral	i love licorice and it '_s become my fave , but it is a bit .... erm .... insipid ... still i am still off the fags !
neutral	the thing wit liberty_flights is speed ... they are so quick and don_'_t charge too much for postage ... i likt the xo supreme too , it give good hit and a nicotine supply whilst tasting good .
neutral	best of all their e_- liquids do n ot have that horrible unnatural taste that some have .
neutral	that '_s why i get all my stuff from them
neutral	found all the products i wanted for a box of british gifts for a friend living_abroad ( marmite , branston pickle and even her favourite chocolate wulnut whirls ) but found the website pretty cumbersome to use .
neutral	the site wouldn_'_t save my order after_placing items in the shopping_cart so all items were lost when i went to other pages on the site or got lgged off , meaning i had to re - enter my list several_times which took_ages .
neutral	however , the box of goodies was delivered to australia quickly and safely despite it being christmas time and my friend was delighted to recieve her good old british favourites ... so it was worth the effort !
neutral	!
neutral	yodel lost my order hopefully you are reprinting them but you will still send them via yodel !!!!!.
neutral	they were supposed to be sent with presents to cape_town , australia and new_zealand before xmas .
neutral	i have sorted further invitations out but will now look for someone that doesn_'_t use yodel .
neutral	i was disappointed that it took them a week to email me to say they had now processed my order and it was ready for collection from the courier .
neutral	not sure why it took so long .
neutral	this means from day of ordering to delivery took 0_days which i think is too slow .
neutral	i am happy with the products , but a price labels was left under one of the tea pots , and i was charged more than the ammount on the label .
neutral	the other pots had had labels taken off because there was still part of the label showing .
neutral	i feel a bit_cheated , and perhaps i should have gone direct to the manufacturer .
neutral	i love my aurora 000 cage for my chinchillas but the delivery service im not as happy about .
neutral	i got an_email_saying the cage would be delivered the next_day before 0 . 00pm but it never arrived after i stayed in all day waiting on it .
neutral	i then got another email the next_day saying it would be delivered that day and was given my hour_slot .
neutral	which it did arrive that day .
neutral	the cage also had a few bumps on the tray which might of been through the delivery process i think but other than those minor_hiccups i am very happy with my new cage .
neutral	i have ordered on two occasions recently , but on both_occasions have recieved a telephone_call informing_me that one of the items ordered was not in stock .
neutral	i was very dissapointed on both_occasions and think that this needs sorting as it has made me think_twice about ordering from you again .
neutral	i was relieved to find that iflorist was still accepting orders for flowers the saturday before mother '_s day - one of the very few .
neutral	they also kept me updated through email , the delivery was very prompt and the flowers were lovely .
neutral	however they bouquet was very expensive and many of my preferred choices were unavailable .
neutral	having said that , overall , i was very glad to have found them .
neutral	not a problem ordering thetablets , didnt take long for them to arrive , but when they did the wrong tablets were sent , although on speaking to them it was soon sorted_out and the correct tablets dispatched .
neutral	disappointed as the flowers arrived at 0 . 00_pm at night .
neutral	they were for my mums_00th_birthday so by then , her_birthday was almost over and she thought i had forgotten about her .
neutral	glasses arrived with correct prescription lenses and frames ... and in a reasonable amount of time .
neutral	however , the lenses were absolutely disgustingly filthy .
neutral	took_ages to get them clean enough to use !
neutral	i am very pleased with the calendars as such .
neutral	but i am not happy with the packaging it came in .
neutral	the envelope was flimsy and the corner was torn in the post and one of the calendars was slightly buckled .
neutral	for next christmas i was going to use jessops cewe to make a full photobook of family history and make 0 copies for myself and my siblings .
neutral	however i will be reluctant to pay out several_hundred_pounds on these if they would be packaged in a similar flimsy manner .
neutral	i would want better packaging .
neutral	i found your all purpose wonder wrap supported my foot quite well
neutral	but would have liked it to be an inch or so narrower .
neutral	as i wanted it to support the inside of my foot and am a size 0 , the width of it cut into either end of my instep .
neutral	if it had been an inch or so narrower it would have suited me better .
neutral	no_doubt a man with a size 00 would have found it perfect .
neutral	i would go on the ship again .
neutral	i feel the company could provide more information on the location where you are going and what events are on .
neutral	i think they should give more info about the on board entertainment and maybe an announcement before the entertainment .
neutral	we sat in our cabin and took our own entertainment as we was unsure if we could use the lounge and did not know when the entertainment started and what it was .
neutral	i ordered a plastic greenhouse and the order was accepted and payment taken .
neutral	however 0_days_later i received an_email which told me the item was out of stock and no new stock would be coming in so i would have my money refunded .
neutral	this happened very quickly but i wondered_why it took 0_days to find out the item was out of stock .
neutral	the hamper is a present for my brother so i am unable to give feedback as to the contents just yet - the presentation is lovely , lovely box and wicker hamper tied with a blg blue bow .
neutral	i would say that it was left on the front doormat and whilst my email said " left_securely at the front of the property ", i would definitely say that was not the case .
neutral	it was left before 0am ( when i got up ) but i did not hear anybody knocking - i live in a one bedroomed house so it '_s not like i was in the " west wing " and missed the delivery man !
neutral	fortunately , from what i have seen so far , i have no reason to believe the contents will not be to a high_standard .
neutral	i also purchased a calendar from bonusprint which cost less .
neutral	you were able to add text and highlight important days such as birthdays .
neutral	think photoworld would benefit from this option .
neutral	the ordering was simple , the item arrived in good time & as far as i can see , there '_s nothing wrong with it .
neutral	the instructions on line video thing were easy to follow .
neutral	i ordered a shower_head holder .
neutral	the fault with my old one was that the plastic insert had perished & i assume that you have to purchase the whole_thing rather_than a bit of plastic insert .
neutral	so i ordered it & it came , nice & shiny & new but no insert !!!
neutral	so the flippin hole was too_big to grip the shower pole , therefore useless .
neutral	just wasted £_00 - 00 .
neutral	ok , there was nothing to say the plastic insert was included but also nothing to say it wasn_'_t .
neutral	i '_m a woman & an old one at that .
neutral	best looking at what i need face to face in the future i think rather_than online .
neutral	the flowers looked quite a bit smaller in life than i had imaged when iooking at the pictures .
neutral	the bunch did seem a bit sparse .
neutral	the service i recieved was great though , fast effiecient and very easy .
neutral	would use again but maybe opt for a more premium bunch next time .
neutral	... the zip on the bag was broken !!
neutral	incredibly disappointing first experience of shopping with pureluxuries sadly .
neutral	probably_won_'_t order again .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting perfect quality ( or even particularly good quality ), but both products i '_d ordered were awful .
neutral	the dress was see through , with uneven seams and the skirt has a poorly stitched zip and , because the material is so shiny and cheap , it just rides up continually .
neutral	as much as i dislike it , i '_ve had higher quality stuff from primark .
neutral	fine for basics & layering , especially if you just want to play around with a certain colour / style before spending any real money on it .
neutral	on the plus , i got free saturday delivery .. and it arrived hassle_free .
neutral	i ordered 0 chairs , all arrived in good time but one chair had missing screws and bolts .
neutral	i never received the replacement fixings and had to call to request twice .
neutral	once the fixings had arrived the chair would not fix together properly .
neutral	they were very good and sent out a replacement chair the next_day which again had the same problem as the first .
neutral	they again sent out another chair which had the yet again the same problem ...... all the while i was having to stay at work to take delivery of the chairs and be there when the faulty ones were collected - quite an inconvenience to be honest !
neutral	i would have thought with the issues surrounding the chairs someone would have put it together to check it was not faulty before arranging couriers to drop_off and collect the amount of times they did .
neutral	so from order to satisfaction it was almost a month .
neutral	whilst i now have 0 lovely chairs , i was a bit disappointed there was no offer of a discount for the huge inconvenience_caused especially with friends and family visiting and being one chair down !
neutral	!
neutral	the service is great but it '_s the second time in 0_weeks that i '_ve had to use the bomb to get_rid of the fleas that my cat has brought in .
neutral	it just doesn_'_t seem to be doing the trick .
neutral	i have defleaed the cat so it s not that .
neutral	i am hoping that this time it works .
neutral	if not , what do you propose ?
neutral	because the treatments aren_'_t cheap !
neutral	thanks jo x
neutral	i need my bags to arrive at their destination on a particular day so booked them in to be collected a day early to be extra sure .
neutral	luckily i did because my bags were not collected on the day i was expecting them to be collected .
neutral	so this meant a wasted day for me waiting for my bags to be collected and no one arrived .
neutral	luckily they were collected the next_day and did arrive on the day i hoped they would .
neutral	it did cause quite a bit of stress but all turned_out ok .
neutral	the flowers delivered were lovely and greatly_appreciated by my friend , however the words i had written which i expected to be typed into your delivery card was blank so she didn_'_t know who they were from .
neutral	good way to find friends whom you have lost contact with , although i find it a bit upsetting when bad_news occurs and its plastered all over facebook , sometimes even before families know themselves !!
neutral	so positives and negatives
neutral	the courier left the flowers on the doorstep - no answer andnot left with a neighbour
neutral	geat product .
neutral	easy to use website .
neutral	just let_down by poor delivery service by ' nightfreight ': i was bombarded by texts and emails from early morning telling_me that my product was on its way but i couldn_'_t access any tracking informaton via the nightfreight website and nor could i get_hold of anyone - their ' live_chat ' customer service capability was always busy .
neutral	the product finally arrived after 0pm in the evening just as i was about to leave the office , so i almost didn_'_t get my delivery and i couldn_'_t access anyone or any info to chase it up - it wasn_'_t worth the extra_cost .
neutral	contacted_iflorist via website to ascertain whether delivery had been made .
neutral	was advised that once delivery had been made i would receive a confirmation_email .
neutral	to date have not received any confirmation of delivery ... would be a good follow through to advise client that their order has_been received .
neutral	this is a simple and straightforward website to use .
neutral	no_frills just fill in and go .
neutral	my only caveat is being asked the length and height my car when i wasn_'_t at home and had no way of checking ( rang the garage !).
neutral	it would be easier to ask for the make and model straight_away .
neutral	ordered 0 voile roman_blinds .
neutral	was a little disappointed with them .
neutral	firstly , the label was put on the hem and therefore was visible through the blind .
neutral	i '_m_sure this is fine with a heavier or lined fabric , but it would have been much_better to fix the label to the back of the top of this blind where it wouldn_'_t be seen .
neutral	secondly , my blinds are brilliant white and the stiffening bars used to construct the blind are off - white and therefore look yellowish through the blind .
neutral	the blinds are well made , it '_s just the mechanics of the bar showing through , which spoil the look .
neutral	it would be better if you could book the extras at the time of booking , saving time when checking your car in .
neutral	wasn_'_t happy the card was expensive and there was no discount for first time buying like other_sites the quality of picture on the card was terrible , and it wasn_'_t posted until the following_monday when i placed order early in a friday , if you order befor 0pm it '_s posted that day with other_sites don_'_t think i will return
neutral	i '_ve been using the website service for a few_years_now since i was introduced via a work_colleague .
neutral	like everything else , i got so comfortable using them and recommending them to friends but my last experience at_stansted was awful .
neutral	sat 0th_may , i arrive at 0 . 00am , busiest day of a bank_holiday_weekend and i find the company had at_least 00 cars backedup outside the airport .
neutral	it was obvious that they had over booked the number of arrivals and not planned the correct number of drivers to resource the service .
neutral	i was very lucky to get my car triple parked and left my keys with the rep , but i was very worried that he was so stressed and my car keys could end up in the hands of the wrong person or even worse , towed away from the airport by the authorities .
neutral	there was a lot of agression among drivers and one actually looked like he bumped the bumper of the car in front as he took the place that was not his outside the airport .
neutral	luckily i had left sufficient time for my valet_parking but suspect others may have been under_pressure for flights and valet_parking should give you the luxury of cutting_down the arrival time to the airport .
neutral	the experience has put me off using some of these companies in future , so i would like to know that looking0parking has investigated such companies and can be confident your customers are presented with the correct level of service that we pay for .
neutral	i '_m due to fly again in mid july from stansted and will be considering my car_parking options more carefully .
neutral	thanks again and keep_up the great work .
neutral	received flowers most dissapointed they were delivered at 0pm instead of 0am .
neutral	good job my mother was very understanding , due to the fact she_lives on her own and happend to see the driver coming up the pathway else she would have not opend the door , quite_rightly so .
neutral	you had my phone number you could have contacted me i would have let my mother know of the delay .
neutral	not sure if i would use this florist again
neutral	i ordered a canon ixus 000 camera and was able to track its delivery until i received it fairly quickly .
neutral	however it was a powershot sd 000 which was sent , which is the us version of the same camera , complete with us battery_charger .
neutral	on hunting through the small_print on bitesizedeals website it states that they may substitute another countries version of the product you order .
neutral	canon uk customer_services state that the warranty of the powershot i was sent is invalid outside the us and that leaves me relying_on the warranty service offered by bitesizedeals themselves .
neutral	i also am left having to buy a uk battery_charger to be able to use the camera .
neutral	bitesizedeals customer_services have not yet got back to me about my complaint .
neutral	if i '_d seen this review website before i would have shopped elsewhere !
neutral	great products but overpriced .
neutral	also , why ask for a signature on delivery ?
neutral	?
neutral	very annoying that the box can '_t be left in my parcel container if i '_m out .
neutral	i tried to make several calls today at different times with different_levels of o0 coverage and my phone froze .
neutral	i could not end call , or turn my phone off .
neutral	i just had to wait for my phone to refresh .
neutral	the phone was then turned off and on and so far today it is better .
neutral	i rang o0 & they advised me to visit a phones 0 u store as i can get a replacement as i '_ve had the phone 0_days !
neutral	not what i expected of the new i phone 0 !!
neutral	!
neutral	lovely flowers shame that 0 of the roses had fallen_off in the box !!!
neutral	!
neutral	goods were left_outside the front_door in full_view of the street , in the pouring_rain , the outer_box was destroyed , if the inside had not been in a plastic_bag they would have been ruined .
neutral	instructions were to leave at next door if we were out , very cross !!
neutral	the goods ordered were fine and exactly as advertised .
neutral	post was rather slow and box was crushed when it arrived , although i was kept up to date with order process with emails .
neutral	i ordered and paid for four dog worming_tablets from vet -_medic .
neutral	they arrived in good time but only two tablets were in the pack .
neutral	i had to phone to let them which was a little inconvenient and i am not sure what i paid for the call , but the person_who answered was very apologetic , recognised the mistake immediately and the missing tablets were received within a couple of days .
neutral	it '_s good but the instant searches before youve finished typing is annoying
neutral	theyre quite slow and i always seem to find hair in my food ...
neutral	gross !
neutral	the flowers were beautiful but the head of the biggest flower had broken off inside the delivery box which was disappointing as they were a gift
neutral	i felt the service was excellent .
neutral	as far as the flowers are concerned i was disappointed in the size of the bunch .
neutral	i had bought a bunch of flowers the day before from waitrose and they cost me £ 0 , they were really lovely .
neutral	the bunch of flowers from yourselves was the same size but cost me £_00 and this was free delivery .
neutral	we had a few_teething_problems with getting our ad live on these sites and struggled to get through to anyone by calling the rentify number to resolve things when our ads first went live they had let agreed across the advert which lost us a day - but once these few niggles were sorted , we had a great response from the ad and we would definitely use rentify again in the future .
neutral	i usually get a quick response from this company but my last two items were late , one was late by nearly 0_weeks , with no message to inform_me it was out of stock , and another was at_least 0_weeks late .
neutral	not happy at the moment !
neutral	i brought 0 products at the same time , both whey_protein 00 , rocky_road and cherry bake well .
neutral	the service i cannot_fault , quick errorless service but both of the products taste synthetic and i really don_'_t like the flavour .
neutral	both are also very thin when mixed up so i don_'_t find them filling .
neutral	i '_ve been using them in baking more than as recovery drinks .
neutral	good value for money , but long waot for order .
neutral	i was promised my booking confirmation would be sent out to me by post to my home address over a week_ago and as yet it has not arrived surely the post shouldn_'_t take this long !
neutral	the back of the remote was missing .
neutral	other than that it seems ok .
neutral	good selection but you charge delivery on orders over_£_000 !
neutral	and you sample order charge is too high at £ 0 . 00 is too high also
neutral	ordering online etc was easy .
neutral	picked my delivery slot to suit my arrangements .
neutral	on the chosen day at around_midday received a voicemail ( recorded ) saying delivery would not be taking place that day , but the next .
neutral	half a day wasted sitting at home and complete change of plan for the next_day in order to be at home for the delivery .
neutral	unacceptable , especially when i am paying for it !!!
neutral	!
neutral	although my mother got her flowers , which so said were lovely .
neutral	the bottle of bubbly which was supposedly included with the offer was not delivered .
neutral	furthermore i specified a date for delivery for mothers_day and they were delivered the day before .
neutral	i also did not receive an explanation or apology as to why the bottle of bubbly was not sent , only this email asking for my opinion .
neutral	the website shouldn_'_t guarantee or promise products and not deliver them .
neutral	however , from what my mother says i feel the flowers were good value , but i was looking for the extra which was promised i . e .
neutral	the bottle of bubbly , so would be hesitant_about ordering from the site again .
neutral	i upgraded these flowers to medium_size and was quite disappointed when i went to my mums to see her .
neutral	the flowers actually looked like two small bunches of flowers from a supermarket put_together and for the price i paid £_00 . 00 ( or as near as ) i wasn_'_t impressed .
neutral	have had two deliveries , both fine and well_packaged .
neutral	receive constant offers / deals by email but have trouble_accessing them .
neutral	tried repeatedly to order chicken_breasts last_week and computer advised me to ring .
neutral	rang at 0 . 00 , kept hanging for some time , then told to leave a message .
neutral	did so , but no return call almost a week_later - have now missed the offer i wanted .
neutral	frustrated by the amount of codes etc that don_'_t seem to work - i asume you can only enter one code per order , but that isn_'_t stated .
neutral	sorry guys , i want to like your company , but it just takes up too much of my time .
neutral	not sure what this smells like as it was a gift but it didn_'_t have any packaging inside the box - i just received the bottle and an empty box .
neutral	the package was not cellophane_wrapped as perfume normally is , which makes me question the authenticity .
neutral	wouldn_'_t have been too bothered if it was for me but as a gift looked shoddy & as if it had already been opened .
neutral	would hesitate to use this company again unless i was buying an item for myself .
neutral	the search process was easy but when booking and confirming it had changed my drop_off and pick_up times !
neutral	when i tried to amend this through my account , the website kept_crashing and wasn_'_t showing my booking ...... very frustrating :(
neutral	brilliant choice of miniatures available !
neutral	only_downside - took over a week for a personalised label to be printed !
neutral	missed b ' day for person it was for .
neutral	would use again , mainly_because of wide_range but would allow more time if i needed it personalised .
neutral	i usually send my flowers thro ' interflora .
neutral	don_'_t know why but this time i had difficulty_getting my order set_up .
neutral	so ..
neutral	i saw this new floraqueen advert and decided to give them a try .
neutral	yes it all went well to the part where they were to notify_me about my order having been delivered .
neutral	i think i sent 0 emails asking if my order had been delivered .
neutral	anyway i just might give them another shot when i need some flowers sent !
neutral	dont like the new timeline and dont_think we should be made to swap to it !
neutral	quality testing needs to be more stringent , have sent the product back as the mug had a significant hole / pock - mark which effected the whole appearance and feel .
neutral	surprised it was packed and posted !
neutral	now dealt_with and a second print is apparently on its way .
neutral	i would have thought there would be at_least a cheaper , if not free rate for shipping when spending a large_amount .
neutral	the variofocals and fit are not as good as last time i ordered them .
neutral	the prescription was the same as was everything else but this time they are not as good or as comfortable .
neutral	no_problems with the delivery .
neutral	i made my order and two_days_later i received a confirmation of shipping with a ref_number .
neutral	went the the weebside with my ref_number every time they told me unknow number .
neutral	call neverland because that is where they are base .
neutral	neverland give me a french number to call .
neutral	finay talk to someone and confirm to me the my goods will arrive the following_monday .
neutral	of cause delivery are from 0am for the all day .
neutral	wait all day monday ..... tuesday ...... wednesday decide to call again and confirm for wednesday .
neutral	finally arrive wednesday .
neutral	could do much_better with information_regarding delivery .
neutral	ordered a grobag on offer , good price for the product but then £ 0 . 00 for postage on an item that weighed less_than 000g !
neutral	what '_s more it took 0_days to arrive which is ridiculous for so called 0st_class .
neutral	wouldn_'_t order again unless postage more reasonable .
neutral	with the voucher from google the price was good .
neutral	however , you are automatically given text_alert and cancellation_cover at a price .
neutral	i didn_'_t notice as i jaws using my phone to book and just kept hitting next .
neutral	be careful !
neutral	arrival was ok but we should be told to go into the short_stay car_park as it was confusing as to where to wait for the driver .
neutral	on pickup i called 00_minutes before but we still waited a further 00_minutes .
neutral	they were very apologetic though .
neutral	i sent some flowers to my mum , who had just come out of hospital , to cheer_her up .
neutral	now this isn_'_t the usual company i use , but because my mum had badly broken her ankle i didn_'_t want her to have to start trying to sort_out flowers into a vase , so i thought i '_d see if i could get them already arranged in one .
neutral	my usual trusted company didn_'_t offer this service which is why i looked for a different company and found clare_florist .
neutral	i ordered a beautiful_bouquet , in a vase , and it was delivered when i asked .
neutral	when they arrived my mum told me they were gorgeous which i was very pleased about obviously , but when i spoke to her 0_days_later she told me that , even_though she had treated them as she was instructed , they had already started dying off .
neutral	i spoke to her again today , just 0_days after delivery and she told me she was going to have to throw them out soon as they were looking sorry for themselves .
neutral	with the other company , the flowers last at_least 0_days before they start going over and most of the time it '_s nearer 0_days .
neutral	i '_m very disappointed and , although the flowers were beautiful and made an initial impact , i know not to use this company again if i want flowers to last :(
neutral	our builder recommended sds .
neutral	couldn_'_t find exactly_what i wanted online so rang them .
neutral	they couldn_'_t give me the answer without speaking to the supplier so suggested i email with my query and they '_d get back to me .
neutral	well that didn_'_t happen !
neutral	had to phone them after no response for 0_days and finally gut the info i wanted .
neutral	poor show .
neutral	second set of china we '_ve ordered from procook , and we '_ve also had 0 orders of pans and some wine_glasses as well in the past year .
neutral	i like their products a lot and they are well - priced .
neutral	up to date the delivery service has_been excellent too , but this time around it was disappointing .
neutral	0 side plates were chipped , no_doubt because the delivery man was being very careless ( threw box down ).
neutral	he also refused to carry the second box up the communal stairs to our flat - he told me it was a 0 man job , and as i am 0mths pregnant and had a toddler in the flat , obviously i couldn_'_t help .
neutral	later , my husband brought the box up on his own without_any difficulty .
neutral	i '_m happy with this site
neutral	ordering can be a problem if you don_'_t know exactly_what you want and can '_t spell it either !
neutral	the website is incapable of accepting incorrect spellings .
neutral	i often have to go and find the bottle to get the spelling correct .
neutral	the website was much_better this time , but still had the same problem .
neutral	often i give up and use the phone .
neutral	paid out ok , but not convinced they are entirely trustworthy , had a better experience with zapper !
neutral	the rubber is really thin and so i don_'_t think they will last very long .
neutral	quite_expensive for what you get .
neutral	the shape is pretty good .
neutral	the delivery process , packaging etc is very good .
neutral	the biggest problem i have is that it runs on a 0 week cycle rather_than monthly .
neutral	this means that the date is not the same for the payment every_month .
neutral	hard to budget when this is 0 weekly and everything else in your budget is monthly .
neutral	food not bad at all - snacks are great .
neutral	when i rang the 0000 number the staff who answered were very helpful & polite .
neutral	what i didn_'_t like was a couple of strange calls i received later in the evening from an 00000 code asking me for my personal details .
neutral	perhaps if accident_helpline provided me with a reference i could verify who i '_m speaking to .
neutral	i ordered the pretty pink bouquet for my daughter to celebrate the birth of her daughter .
neutral	i cannot_fault the on going customer communication and notifications but i felt on this occasion the actual flowers were disappointing .
neutral	the pods were already falling from the lillies and the pinks and chrysanths were not as fresh and vibrant as expected .
neutral	the flowers did not live up to the expectations of the illustrated bouquet .
neutral	a bit like expecting a sparkling firework and getting a damp squib .
neutral	i have ordered before and this is the first time i have viewed what i have ordered and it has left me wondering_if other recipients were just being polite or were their flowers up to scratch
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of glasses on your website , 0 for distance and 0 for reading .
neutral	my distance / driving glasses are a great fit and just what i wanted .
neutral	however , my reading_glasses keep slipping off my face .
neutral	i have taken them into a local_opticians to get them adjusted but they have stretched out again .
neutral	are you able to advise me what i may have done wrong with these glasses so that i know for the next pair i order ?
neutral	the vaginal pumps need instructions on how to make them stick and stay in place and the website needs to updated more to show items out of stock .
neutral	the vaginal pump has_been a total_waste of money as i am unable to make it stay in place but it is a very good concept .
neutral	the other items bought are quite good quality .
neutral	style of knob matched exactly but the contact piece needed filing to enable the knob to fit properly
neutral	easy to use website , quick and efficient but lacked giving detail for trip once purchased , where do we go , how early do we need to arrive etc .
neutral	this means i have to research to get the details .
neutral	i have been told on my email to pick_up the tickets on our arrival to the port but where do i pick them up ?
neutral	these simple after sales details would be very much_appreciated by all customers i am sure .
neutral	it may even incur a phone_call as i like to be prepared for a trip and this defeats the object of booking online .
neutral	the speed of delivery was fine , bunch of flowers lovely .
neutral	just a shame they were all drooping .
neutral	not as easy as it was - moving the taxi_rank has made it a smaller facility with the access road tight
neutral	given that people using this service are usually stressed to get to a plane on time or knackered from a long journey home , the drivers and staff on the phone could be more precise .
neutral	we phoned 00_minutes away and were told to go to the car_park .
neutral	we did and we waited for 00_minutes which at 0am is a long time , only to have to phone them again to find that the driver had been waiting on chairs facing away from the cars .
neutral	whilst not a big deal it was annoying .
neutral	we fly standby a lot , so we arrive very early for a good reason .
neutral	coming_back we found we had to pay the parking ( not had that before ) and we didn_'_t know and had no english money to hand , so we had to unpack a case by the barrier to find some coins .
neutral	we were not happy about this ... just telling us would have been helpful .
neutral	doesn_'_t mean we won_'_t use it again but prefer the [_external_reference_] people although they don_'_t use the car_parks .
neutral	i '_m not sure_whether the 0 week wait time was down to the actual supplier of my oil , or whether it was due to me going via the boilerjuice website , but a 0 week wait for oil is ridiculous .
neutral	i know that if i '_d rang any of my local suppliers , i '_d have had the oil delivered in 0_days max .
neutral	i only got half a pence_per_litre saving so , i don_'_t know if i '_ll use the website again for ordering , but will_continue to use it for comparison .
neutral	i think it is short_sighted and archaic that any company let_alone a trade supplier , especially online - would only deliver to the cardholder '_s address .
neutral	we have been trading for over 00years , professionally and personally i have ordered online .
neutral	i found it frustrating that it was not possible to have any other delivery address other than the cardholder '_s !!!
neutral	apart_from the delivery problems i was very pleased with the service and would consider_using this company again if they were to change their delivery policy !
neutral	entirely unnecessary to have all the speel about booking on line , when you have requested that having booked , one still has to telephone for including a dog , it used to be at the bottom of the page to add at the same time and pay all at once .
neutral	ordering my child '_s fancy_dress costume was very straight_forward and delivery was really quick .
neutral	i was very impressed and would like to rate this very highly .
neutral	however , after a week the elastic in the trousers has_gone and the velcro on the belt has come off .
neutral	the costume is poorly made for regular use and after inially being really happy with the website , the process , delivery and price i '_m now disappointed the costume is falling_apart .
neutral	the bag arrived very quickly . unfortunately when using it for the first time in natural daylight have noticed some discolouring in the canvas .
neutral	maybe item should have been thoroughly checked before dispatch .
neutral	as first time parents to be , we have everything to buy , my partner and i fell in love with a cot_bed on the precious_little one website and it was the best offer .
neutral	my mum offered to buy it as a present .
neutral	ordering was very simple and straightforward and it stated that it would be 0 - 0_days delivery time which was fine for us as we have started to decorate the nursery .
neutral	however after a week had past and no correspondence from them we were concerned .
neutral	looking at the confirmation we got , it then said delivery could be up to 00 days , which made us worry less but disappointed we '_d have to wait that long .
neutral	after this time had been and gone we did receive an_email to say that there had been a technical mistake their end on the order and we would have to wait a little_longer .
neutral	my partner had to stay in the day of delivery only for it to be delivered and when he put up the cot it was damaged with a crack in the wood .
neutral	he called the company who were very apologetic and said they would pick it up the next_day but not sure when they could replace with a new one .
neutral	my partner had to stay in the following_day which was annoying , but thankfully the faulty cot was collected and a replacement cot was delivered at the same time which was great and cot was fine .
neutral	i think my mum felt a bit embarrassed about it as i think because she had bought this as a present for her new grandchild and had to wait so long only for the first cot to be faulty .
neutral	the cot is lovely and although the experience wasn_'_t great we are happy with it and cant_wait to see our new baby sleeping in it in august_0000 .
neutral	we do hope that if we make more purchases from this company that the delivery etc will be a bit more straight_forward .
neutral	i thought the company was very quick with its delivery and the price was excellent .
neutral	i was disappointed that the tap did not have the correct washers for the hoses supplied and the waste outlet did not fit properly .
neutral	i had to pay extra for additional parts .
neutral	we had a problem with 0 of the items - the 0 tone bloack & the jingle stick .
neutral	the jingle stick was of very poor quality and was replaced straight_away .
neutral	the 0 tone block is broken the whole is far too_big and the stick keep falling out , we are still_waiting on replacement !
neutral	!
neutral	i have been customer to this company for years although their prices are good i have to admit their cigs is useless
neutral	having paid_extra for two day delivery did not expect to have to wait a week for delivery .
neutral	items were as requested so can only suggest the delivery company used is reviewed and maybe changed .
neutral	caused a bit of stress
neutral	company who sold table very helpful , advised on type of table we had chosen made some suggestions that we may be purchasing the wrong type of table for purpose , had no_problems with service at all , until delivery , delivered by 0 lazy oafs who refused to move the table into the school left it propped against a fence on full_view of public and unsecured , shook his head that we actually wanted him to carry the table into the school , they were useless and unfortunately let this company down , i dont_know how much you pay for delivery but i would consider_changing as they let your excellent service completely down , as i will not consider your company again untli you change the delivery drivers .
neutral	sorry !
neutral	i ordered a basket for my mum as that is what the hospital preferred .
neutral	i didn_'_t see it until 0_days after it had been delivered and my initial impression was that for £_00 it was very small !
neutral	it was colourful and gave off a lovely scent , both of which were important , but i couldn_'_t_believe_how quickly it was over , given that the oasis had been kept wet .
neutral	most of the flowers were on the decline and some had already had to be pulled_out of the display .
neutral	my mum even went as far as to ask if we could take the basket to a local_florist and get it re - filled .
neutral	on the whole , i was a bit disappointed .
neutral	was dissapointed this time round because since our last booking in feb its changed , we like to book straight_forward short_stay park ... now it is do you want to surface park ???
neutral	or multistorey ... then when i went to book surface park because it was cheaper i could up grade to multistorey parking for £ 0 a day ... which was much_cheaper .
neutral	stop this nonsence and just give us straight_forward parking price and stop ripping us off
neutral	initially i was very impressed with this company but a set of roman_blinds that i purchased 0 years_ago broke after just one year .
neutral	on the positive_note , the website is really easy to navigate , the sample service very quick , and delivery quite fast for being made to measure .
neutral	also they are very easy to install .
neutral	after the first purchase i have since ordered a lot more blinds and hope they last .
neutral	the bags we ordered are thinner_than the last bags we bought ( from somewhere_else ) - i was looking for a similar bag so have been disappointed with the ' thinness ' of the bag .
neutral	it took a couple of days shy of a month between placing my order and recieving my album .
neutral	quality item though - glossy and well made !
neutral	i ordered several products for a party only 00_hrs ahead so needed next_day delivery .
neutral	products did arrive on time but quality of them was very poor .
neutral	0 ) tasselled 0000s dress lost a lot of tassels as soon as i took it out of the packet .
neutral	0 ) i am 0 ' 0 " and the length of the skirt was so short it did not cover my crotch !
neutral	i had to borrow a longer black slip to wear underneath from a friend
neutral	0 ) safety_pin on headdress shows from the front
neutral	0 ) fish net tights did not fit to shape of leg , ie when you pulled them up , material stretched from toes to calf in a straight line without touching ankle !
neutral	0 ) black long velvet gloves were missing a thumb !
neutral	i could only use parts of the outfit but i ordered it at such short_notice i could not return it .
neutral	i would suggest to future customers you order stuff as early as possible so you can check quality and make returns if_necessary . in plenty of time .
neutral	took quite a bit to be received which is no fault of the company , but then was atleast 0_days after they had received it when i received my money
neutral	i found the location convenient and quick and would have been very happy with the service , except the paint work on the car had been damaged over the wheel hub and pocked in other_places .
neutral	i didn_'_t notice straight_away ( the car had become very dirty during the 0 day stay ) - it was another meet and greet company who pointed_out the damage a day later .
neutral	it was more noticeable because i had paid to have car sprayed and polished only a couple of weeks before !
neutral	no especifica en la factura los gastos envio , y cuando lo pides no refleja el iva
neutral	i like the wide_range of items on offer and i like some of the specially priced offers .
neutral	the ones i don_'_t like are the ones that allow you to get a special price only if you order another item with it , usually another item you don_'_t want or don_'_t need .
neutral	the drivers are a strong point .
neutral	friendly , helpful , a pleasure to deal with .
neutral	customer service can be friendly and helpful at times , but in the last few_months has tended to be abrupt and unwelcoming .
neutral	the really bad thing for me is the packing .
neutral	heavy solid items with fragile pastries or fruits .
neutral	who on earth thinks it '_s a good idea to put two heavy bottles of bleach in with a number of small pots of yogurt ( which then are smashed and leaking )?
neutral	why on earth would they put cleaning items in with a ( squashed ) loaf of bread ?
neutral	also , who puts a pack of six 0 . 0 litre_bottles of water in with oranges ( mashed also )?
neutral	i no_longer order things like berries ( had too many that were crushed ) or bread ( almost always mashed flat ) or tarts and pastries ( crushed ).
neutral	i '_ve asked for innumerable refunds and they do that quickly and obligingly , but the packing never improves .
neutral	they must be spending a fortune on refunds because of the bad packing , so why don_'_t they learn ?
neutral	very happy with the speed of delivery and communication i received about my order .
neutral	disappointing that for an online company i had to pay for returns - even by collect_+ which i have never had to do before !
neutral	i ordered four items and within less_than a week i received a package .
neutral	however , i had ordered two bottles of opi_nail_polish , a cuticle oil and a cuticle removal instrument .
neutral	only one bottle of nail_polish arrived , with no explanation as to why one was missing .
neutral	i then phoned hq_hair who advised that due to low stock the other item would be sent when it became_available .
neutral	i am more than happy with what i have received so far but do feel that an explanation of the missing item would have been welcome in the package .
neutral	one week on and i am still_waiting with no email update either of when the remaining bottle may be sent to me .
neutral	was pretty straightforward to order flowers .
neutral	good price for flowers to be delivered and with promise of next_day delivery .
neutral	they were delivered as promised and although it was within given time i was disappointed that delivery was made so late at night , after 0pm .
neutral	i found it very confusing to know what exactly i was buying and i called for further support and didn_'_t get a straight answer either .
neutral	i '_m not keen that you show pictures for a medium but the price next to it is for standard !
neutral	straight_away i felt i wasn_'_t sure i could trust the company or the site as to what was getting sent to my colleague !
neutral	i have ordered to give you a chance however i do hope you take on this feedback as i really went back & forwards in the buying experience as well trying to actually pay when i removed an extra one that had been added to my basket , the system then removed both my items in the basket so i had to take time to key in all my information again .
neutral	not a smooth experience .
neutral	hope its helpful feedback
neutral	regards

neutral	the website was really tricky and over complicated .
neutral	the finished_product was good and arrived within a week .
neutral	i would use it again if it was made easier to use ,
neutral	delivery was not with the stated courier , so we had to travel 00 miles each way to collect our parcel .
neutral	one costume was marked on all the white sections , not happy with the outcome .
neutral	tried to order 0 rolls of 0 paper and 0 of another together but once i got to payment it kept telling_me to start over - so had to order items on 0 orders .
neutral	because of this one order went to a home address and the other had to go to store - because the cost wasn_'_t high enough , i emailed customer_services within minutes of placing the order to ask for all items to go together as spent quite a bit but was told this was not possible ... i just think its a shame that this could not have been done for me as now i have the 0 rolls at my house but still need to drive and collect the other 0 .
neutral	on a plus note the paper is lovely !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered from purewell as cheapest price , delivery was quoted as 0 - 0_days but after 0_days my order still hadn_'_t been despatched .
neutral	order was sent on next_day service after i complained .
neutral	would be reluctant to use again .
neutral	when you buy large_quantity of seeds you need longer best before date
neutral	the office_chair is great when assembled and it looks to be worth much more than it cost .
neutral	however , it was really awkward to put_together and the instructions were poor .
neutral	you need patience :-)
neutral	i ordered a red sweater as a christmas_present , the website was easy to use and the garment arrived promptly .
neutral	unfortunately it arrived in a bag with ' superdry ' printed in bold print all over it & the person i had bought it for as a christmas surprise saw it and guessed it was for them , which spoilt it rather .
neutral	when i opened the parcel the colour of the sweater seemed significantly different to how it looked in the photo on the website i had anticipated a truer ' christmas red ' and it was a rather rusty - red .. i didnt like the colour , so decided to return it ...
neutral	on further_investigation_into the return procedure i noted that i would have to pay postage ( not something i have encountered with other on - line purchases , from other big name companies ) and would i be liable to loss theft or damage to the goods in transit ... and to post it securely was very costly ... i noticed that i also had the option of taking it to a ' click and return ' agent but the nearest one to me was a good 00 - 00minute drive_away , in an out of the way place ...
neutral	all a bit of an effort at a busy time of year , and costly in petrol , too
neutral	sorry , but i will hesitate to order online from superdry again , i think .
neutral	although my bathroom is not yet fully installed it looks good and i think i am going to be pleased with it .
neutral	what i wasnt please with was the delivery !
neutral	having paid_extra for guaranteed delivery on monday i was surprised when it didnt appear .
neutral	when i rang customer_services ( from my mobile as i was at work ) i was kept hanging on for more than ten_minutes while the woman contacted the delivery firm .
neutral	she then told me that the delivery company had lost it and it would have to be delivered the next_day instead .
neutral	she then checked that she had my mobile number ( reading out a totally different number to mine ), i gave her the correct number and she then said " goodbye mrs xxx , which wasnt my name at all !
neutral	i then said do you know which customer you are talking to and is it my stuff that has got lost or someone_elses ?
neutral	she said it was mine but by now i had little confidence that she knew what she was talking_about .
neutral	eventually my suite was delivered at 0pm on the tuesday , but when i spoke to the delivery company they knew nothing about the order being lost and said it was the fault of better_bathrooms .
neutral	i have no problem with the goods or the quality of them but someone needs to look at your delivery procedure .
neutral	the service was good and i would have given them 0_stars but i felt the delivery charges were expensive and it was not easy to return the product .
neutral	it would be much_better if they did a collect in store and return service .
neutral	i don_'_t like paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery then if you don_'_t like it the same to return , you end up out of pocket with no item .
neutral	only wanted to borrow £_000 just to cover me till pay day and they phone you up several_times and ask for bank details and i only had to repay £_000 on my payday .
neutral	but when the loan was accepted and they had taken all my bank details they then told me its free to put the money in my account in 0 working_days but it will cost £_00_quid to put it in the same day .
neutral	its a con because they know people need it the same day
neutral	i bought the steampunk sally costumes , thanks to a customer review i knew what it came with and what it didn_'_t include however trying to get the additions on the website has_been impossible and i had to shop elsewhere , the costume also wasn_'_t everything i expected the sizing is off , says standard 00 - 00 luckily i '_m a 00 so it fits but it would never fit my mother who is a size 00 so if i were any larger i would have been really disappointed .
neutral	the lace top is cropped which is a major disappointment and the corset is velcro !
neutral	although fast delivery and i will wear my costume , it wasn_'_t worth the price .
neutral	i ' am very happy with my purchase but i think you should get your emails send in time i received my purchase last_week but received a email today saying it was on its way
neutral	one of the shoes had faded , maybe it had been on display for a long time , the delivery service was excellent .
neutral	just disappointed the shoes were not the same colour , as i had to pay 0 . 00 to return them , so i am out of pocket for an item that was faulty , if the website description had stated one shoe was faded i would never have ordered them .
neutral	simple ordering process .
neutral	good communication up to the point of dispatch .
neutral	advised goods dispatched 00th_dec - actully recieved very late_afternoon on 0th_jan by yodel couriers .
neutral	even allowing for the xmas holidays - this would appear to have taken much longet to deliver than we would jave expected .
neutral	when i placed the order i filled in the box regarding special instructions .
neutral	how to find the house and what to do if i was out !
neutral	( luckily i wasn_'_t ) none of this was passed on !
neutral	i read the work sheet he had !
neutral	why ?
neutral	you advertise the fact that if the customer is out keys etc can be left and the work completed .
neutral	the engineer was very good and 0 tyres_replaced and tracking done efficiently .
neutral	product was very good , but customer service was not .
neutral	items not delivered when scheduled , a chaser to customer service prompted a response saying that the order could not be completed .
neutral	delivery was re - scheduled without the missing items , but due to notes added to the order ( not by the customer ) could not be completed and was re - scheduled .
neutral	delivery finally took place over a week after it had been scheduled .
neutral	fast service , shame about the delivery carrier , my package was late despite paying extra for guaranteed delivery .
neutral	hi there ,
neutral	as a cambridge dieter , i was delighted to be able to obtain something_similar online without having to go through a counsellor .
neutral	i think the shakes and the bars taste ok and i like the fact that the shakes are obtainable in a bottle so can be shaken and taken to work .
neutral	my real problem is with the meals - they are dried in packets and you add water .
neutral	to be honest i think they are the most disgusting thing i have ever_tasted !
neutral	i tried three different ones just to make_sure i wasn_'_t just disliking one flavour but the consistency and the and taste is just unpleasant .
neutral	sorry , i hate to say it but i can '_t imagine anyone could like this rehydrated stodge .
neutral	that '_s not to say i '_m giving up on exante but perhaps supplying ready_meals that you mix with water is a mistake .
neutral	really cheap prices but took 0_months to arrive .
neutral	but they did send an_apology so sorted it a little
neutral	easy web order , and fast delivery , searching on the site would benefit from improvement , items ordered were as_described online .
neutral	product was good , although as this is a family run business was disapointed with the delivery times . paid for second class and nothing had arrived 00 days_later chased and they said they were very busy .
neutral	saving_grace is they did manage to get my parcel to me in 00_hrs so the birthday_girl wasnt disapointed .
neutral	shame i had to chase .!
neutral	!
neutral	when making my order i selected the option to choose the day of delivery ( costing more ) as i wanted to know that i '_d be in .
neutral	however i wasn_'_t given the option to choose the day .
neutral	i emailed , but after a couple of hours with no answer i phoned and was told that there was a problem with the website which_meant i couldn_'_t select a day .
neutral	( i '_m not sure if they meant a permanent of temporary problem .
neutral	they said that the delivery had already gone , but fortunately they use dpd , so i was given the option of changing the day , which i did .
neutral	however it isn_'_t what i paid for .
neutral	apart_from that the comms were good and and i '_m_glad they use dpd .
neutral	i was quite disappointed when i received the package as some of my orders were missing and others had been replaced by some products i didn_'_t want and didn_'_t particularly_liked ...
neutral	after_speaking on the phone i was assured i could have the delivery made to a different address as the prescription was for my son .
neutral	the delivery came to my address 😟
neutral	luckily it came very promptly so i had time to send it to him but it was a bit_annoying after specifically checking .
neutral	expected to receive the rug within a week or two as per confirmation , but nothing arrived .
neutral	i called and left a message with no responce - so emailed .
neutral	contact was received to highlight the rug wasn_'_t in stock and not expecting for over 0_weeks .
neutral	wasn_'_t happy but accepted .
neutral	was contacted when to expect delivery so stayed in to receive the rug , no rug arrived .
neutral	received answer machine message_stating the rug will be delivered the next_day - finally arrived and looks great
neutral	have used this transfer service twice once in may which was brilliant on both_journeys ( to and from airport ) and just recently in august .
neutral	our return to airport was brilliant but our pick_up from airport to resort did not show and another service took over the booking after ringing the number of the firm and getting clearance .
neutral	we bought six engraved trophies as ' achievement awards ' at my primary_school .
neutral	they were silver and blue as the school colours .
neutral	children were delighted to receive a trophy which they could keep for one term .
neutral	when they were returned to school after the first term , the blue had turned to pink !
neutral	the trophy_store evenually replaced the trophies like for like , so we now wait to see if the replacements turn pink !
neutral	ordered my stuff and i had put on the extra delivery information to ' not leave give to a neighbour ' and because they got royal_mail to deliver it , what happened ?
neutral	they took it away and i had to wait an extra 0_days for delivery so this " express delivery " jokers masqulatie is a joke !
neutral	literally !
neutral	now i wasted my money on express delivery .
neutral	will not be ordering any time soon !
neutral	it was very easy to place an order and was quick to be sent but the delivery was bad couldnt find address but couldnt ring to ask where it was .
neutral	missed a meeting to wait for delivery and didnt_recieve order until 0_days_later .
neutral	the website is great , very easy to navigate and a great sale .
neutral	once i had ordered my product i was thrilled when it came really quickly in plenty of time for christmas .
neutral	however once i opened it , the bike computer i had ordered was rattling a round loose in the envolope as it had come out of the flimsey packaging it came in .
neutral	the mount for the bike computer box was also bashed and did not look the nice christmas gift i intended .
neutral	i have used your service before and found it great , so was a bit gutted as i am worried the computer could have been damaged in transit by the time it arrived at my door .
neutral	regards
neutral	lisa
neutral	we were abit disappointed that the part was delivered soaking_wet .
neutral	my son decided to leave the light in the sun rather_than return it , it took 0_days to dry out , i would have returned it .
neutral	i think 0st choice did an excellent job in getting the quotes but i am not happy with company who delivered part .
neutral	wish they had kept me posted on the despatch / delivery .
neutral	i had to keep chasing and eventually i contacted their delivery company myself - frustrating !
neutral	!
neutral	can '_t find the icon to print out my booking but otherwise it was straight_forward .
neutral	on returning an unsuitable nail colour ( it was not quite the same colour as advertised on the website ) it took just under 0_weeks for customer_services to acknowledge the same .
neutral	while it does_state this on the website it '_s not very clear and would ideally be on the paperwork when the item is originally sent , to avoid_confusion .
neutral	great service
neutral	the service was average .
neutral	arrival - we travelled late arriving in turkey in the evening and had to wait the best part of an_hour for other passengers to arrive from their flight .
neutral	although the resort_hoppa representative was very friendly , we were extremely tired and had no real explanation of how much time we might have to wait .
neutral	departure - the app that we were told to download didn_'_t allow us to find out our pick_up time , so i had to call them .
neutral	this was very tricky because the turkish representatives spoke little english and so i had to ask our hotel reception staff to speak with them for us .
neutral	all of this was pretty stressful at the end of our holiday , as we were panicking that we may need to arrange alternative transport .
neutral	work is good but needing to see as a review at the end would save any changes
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of running leggings , i got the order confirmation etc .
neutral	when my parcel arrived only one pair of the leggings were delivered , someone had scribbled in pen on the dispatch_note ' not sent ' on the item which i did not receive .
neutral	no explanation or apology or even if i was going to be sent a replacement pair !
neutral	i still have heard_nothing even_though i emailed customer_services !
neutral	also the 0 pairs of leggings i purchased were under a £_00 off offer if you spent over_£_00 , so i '_m assuming i will get charged full price for the leggings i recwived which is wrong !
neutral	not very happy !
neutral	our trip out to dunkirk was fine , but our return trip was not .
neutral	the weather_conditions meant we were not able to leave dunkirk and i accept that this was not your fault .
neutral	we had to wait over 0 hours late at night in the port building with 0 young_children ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) which was cold no where for them to sleep and the facilities to get anything to eat or drink was very poor .
neutral	once able to board the boat we were hoping of being_able to settle to sleep or to give the children something to do to find people sleeping in the childrens play_area .
neutral	we headed to the childrens tv area to find the dvd_player was not working of which i know when we traveled with you in november it wasnt working then either !
neutral	the tea and coffee was very welcome but nothing for children .
neutral	the breakfast also was a nice welcome .
neutral	we travel with you 0 - 0 times a year and have done for a number of years_now .
neutral	we have noticed your facilities for children improve over the years but on this trip it failed you .
neutral	we relay on your tv area when the play_area is full or when the other children maybe playing to rough for our young_children and not to have a working dvd for over a month !
neutral	not having any refreshments for children was not helpful .
neutral	we also found the lack of information also not helpful and i had to go a few_times to ask for news as it was christmas_eve i had a very worried 0 and 0 year not knowing if they would be home in time for santa coming or if he would be able to find them .
neutral	my husband and i both felt it was a difficult situation but you could of done so much more for those travelling with children and at this special time of year
neutral	arrived in good time , but one of the miniatures had broken inside the packaging !
neutral	was quite disappointed as it was a gift for a friend '_s birtday ...
neutral	items ordered friday , received wednesday .
neutral	this is not next working day delivery as advertised .
neutral	the service , delivery speed and card itself was all great .
neutral	sadly the envelopes let the side down .
neutral	they are far to big for the cards which doesn_'_t reflect the quality of overall package i had hoped for .
neutral	well on arrival to destination waited for 0 / 0 hour for pick_up . the fiteen minute journey we were told took nearly 0 / 0 hour . on return arrived at pick_up point for time they asked . bus was 00_minutes late . driver missed one client and had to do a return to pick_up point . from there almost at airport when driver apologised and returned to resort and did a further 0 or 0 pick_up before eventually heading bak to airport . as you can_imagine was not very pleased . may think again about using resort_hoppa .
neutral	i ordered flowers to arrive in england when i was visiting my parents for my stepmother '_s birthday .
neutral	i ordered them for the day before her_birthday as we were going to france on her_birthday for lunch .
neutral	well they arrived the day of her_birthday and had to be taken in by a neighbour .
neutral	quality was reasonable considering the extreme snow etc .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	the roses showed some deterioration , browning on petals .
neutral	i have used storagemart since 0000 since_moving back to england .
neutral	i was told storagemart was the best place for my belongings .
neutral	i visited canada and my unit on wednesday , 00 february_0000 and questioned my bill as this increased by 00_% without notice .
neutral	lyndsey ( who i commend as she has always been helpful and informative ) explained it is normal for price increases however i was not notified .
neutral	email has always been my only form on contact as i live in england .
neutral	i discovered it cheaper to become a new client with storagemart after 0 years .
neutral	i had to move all of my belongings from units myself and i now save over_$_00 a month .
neutral	there should be more loyalty after 0 years if payments are made on time and no_issues .
neutral	i purchased a pair of adidas golf_shoes , had them on about 0 times , due to our lovely weather , had the chance to go back out and play the game i love to find out that the right shoe was letting in water , phoned littlewoods explained the situation , they were so nice on the phone , told me to return them and they would credit my account with the £_000 that they cost .
neutral	a few_weeks_later the shoes were returned to me , no letter stating why , i had to phone littlewoods again , i was told that i had to proof there was a fault within the shoe myself and that i had to get in touch with adidas , now the way i see it is that i purchased the shoe from littlewoods and it should have been up them to find the fault , according to the sales of goods_act , this should have been the case .
neutral	i have always been happy shopping with littlewoods but was left very disappointed with the way i was treated .
neutral	travel up showed having a great price but in the end paid £_00 more than the advertised price .
neutral	did still end up £_00 cheaper but not as great as i originally thought
neutral	slats arrived quickly but had to wait longer for rail to arrive .
neutral	easy to fit although not blackout does dim the room slightly .
neutral	looks good and would buy normal blinds again .
neutral	my windows are long but the cords were short so you have to stretch to reach cord and i am tall .
neutral	i have to say that i am a very regular customer of amazon - most weeks i buy something and i always go there first .
neutral	on the whole , they tend to be the cheapest , although they ' re not always the fastest and their packaging does leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	my last purchase really annoyed me however .
neutral	i bought a game for my grandson - it had lots of little bits that had to be pushed out and put_together before playing it , so imagine my disappointment and shock when i opened the box and it had all been done - clearly second_hand but i hadn_'_t paid a second_hand price .
neutral	i find this entirely unacceptable and think somebody had probably ordered and returned it , but nobody_bothered to check the returned goods .
neutral	that '_s my guess anyway .
neutral	in any case , it has made me rethink my constant use of them .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother to return the game and just kept it , how many other people are like me and can '_t be bothered to complain ?
neutral	i think i will look elsewhere for products now and not just keep going there blindly .
neutral	in addition , the bad_press about not paying taxes has made me uncomfortable with them anyway .
neutral	why should i pay tax and they don_'_t ?
neutral	so i '_ll be buying a lot less in the future from them .
neutral	good service but feel like i '_m paying £_00 over the odds for the call out charge , might as well visit a tyre place , its not worth £_00 for convenience of staying at home .
neutral	brought the coat and is really warm however the writing on the front has nearly all but rubbed off which is disappointing especially as only been wearing since christmas
neutral	the price was good so i went_ahead and ordered but i didn_'_t realise they use a courier for delivery .
neutral	cue having to wait in all day for the parcel .
neutral	next time i will order with my old supplier .
neutral	a wee_bit more_expensive but they use royal_mail .
neutral	waaaay more convenient and more flexible about redelivery .
neutral	i think the car should have been parked closer to the entrance on return , not easy to walk through a car_park with cases and 0 children under 0 when there are cars driving around but apart_from that a very good service .
neutral	managed to get all three dvd '_s to play on my computer but it wasn_'_t easy .
neutral	i had to fast forward to get them to work .
neutral	i tried one of them on a dvd_player today with no success !
neutral	pleased with items received and delivery was swift however plastic_container was smashed so bird nuts mixed with broken plastic .
neutral	my order did not contain all the products i had ordered .
neutral	there was no communication of this , they just credited my account and sent the stock they had .
neutral	the trouble was that i had a project in mind and some of the supplies to make this project were not sent so the other supplies were redundant as i could not make my project .
neutral	i would have rather they let_me know ahead of time or make the other products backorder and send them later .
neutral	just to cancel the items was not satisfactory .
neutral	i wrote and let them know i was not happy and they sent me a free_postage_label to return what i did not want .
neutral	this still does not help me to make the project i wanted to make .
neutral	the delivery service and promptness fantastic .
neutral	unfortunately , the item i ordered appeared quite different ( colour - wise ) to online pic , so i had to return ( and pay returns charge )
neutral	bought a drawer_unit and it arrived damaged .
neutral	phoned the company who apologised for the inconvenience and they sent another which was even more damaged than the first .
neutral	they are now sending a third so i hope that it is third time lucky .
neutral	i don_'_t think it is victorian_plumbing '_s fault , the goods have obviously come from the manufacturer .
neutral	after getting so far through the booking process that i '_d entered my card_details and clicked ' confirm this booking ' a number of times at a certain price , the very last_hurdle was a page stating the price had gone up by 00_quid .
neutral	half tempted to just say ' f - it ' because the process had taken so long , i held out and went through the entire thing again .
neutral	got the original price .
neutral	how much extra have you made through people assuming they can '_t get what they were quoted , and who were panicked into booking for more than advertised in case it went up yet again ?
neutral	smells of scammy .
neutral	difficult to give full experience as i have not received my order yet !
neutral	happy with the product and delivery , but the promised free pillows were not delivered .
neutral	i should have known better - still_waiting for the free matress protectors from my previous order 0_months_ago !
neutral	i received delivery fairly promptly but only one third arrived although delivery note would make one believe all dispatched in one package .
neutral	made contact with company via telephone , most helpful and has promised me missing items to follow - i await their arrival .
neutral	record were very efficient at the airport and pick_up and drop_off was quick and easy .
neutral	the bone of contention for me was having to pay for a full_tank of diesel on a 0 day hire .
neutral	when i returned the car there was 0 / 0 of a tank of diesel left .
neutral	the car had made a return trip from palma_airport to port andratx , return trip to andratx town and a return trip to palma from port andratx .
neutral	realistically , we were not going to use the car much more than that in 0_days and yet i had to pay for a full_tank of diesel .
neutral	it would make me wary of booking for a shorter time period with record again and i would investigate the charging policies of other_providers more closely when booking a hire_car .
neutral	wrong item sent and although they are sorting it out i '_m still_waiting for some items after nearly 0_weeks .
neutral	very rough finish , but i suppose you get what you pay for .
neutral	it took a few_days for my order to be delivered which was fine .
neutral	however , when i unwrapped the outer plastic_bag the boots were packed in , i noticed straight_away that the box was badly_dented and battered .
neutral	on opening them , they seemed to be undamaged .
neutral	they were not quite the colour i was expecting from the picture online but they looked good quality so i tried them on .
neutral	they were really comfortable so i decided to keep them .
neutral	unfortunately , as i took them off , i noticed that the zip on one of the boots had split_open .
neutral	as i really liked them and didn_'_t want the hassle of sending them back , i tried the old trick of rubbing the teeth of the zip with a candle which seems to have worked ( for now , anyway !).
neutral	so , not perfect but just about ok !
neutral	i was having to purchase the part because my fridge_/_freezer was delivered without an adjustable leg .
neutral	curry '_s were to pay for it but i had to order and pay and then claim money back , unfortunately no invoice with the goods and curry '_s will not re - imburse me without one .
neutral	i am still_awaiting this piece of paper so i can get my money back , surely int his day and age it '_s not too much_trouble to either enclose in parcel , or email and invoice to the customer .
neutral	ordered 0 but only got 0 but the service was sort of ok
neutral	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
neutral	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort_out my problem .
neutral	monday_morning got a text saying " your parcel will be with you today " as i was on my way to work , called in sick and ran home .
neutral	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh ?
neutral	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn_'_t think too much about it .
neutral	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer service number i found online .
neutral	she then tells_me that i wasn_'_t at home when the driver stopped by ...
neutral	what ?????
neutral	that '_s a lie !
neutral	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
neutral	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
neutral	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
neutral	its now 0 : 00 and she tells_me she finishes at 0 and as she cant get thru the driver nor the depot i '_ll have to call back in the morning !
neutral	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
neutral	i didn_'_t miss work for nothing !
neutral	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they '_d already got their item .
neutral	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
neutral	i now had to call currys to sort_out this issue in order for them to re - deliver my parcel and as they refused to allocate me a time_slot i then arranged for thursday .
neutral	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
neutral	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn_'_t been dispatched and also that they don_'_t know where it is .... is this for real ???
neutral	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
neutral	mr kwame then after apologizing a million times said he will find it and sort it out .
neutral	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .
neutral	it arrived at 0pm .
neutral	thanks to mr kwame i didn_'_t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
neutral	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer service , if they can be called that .
neutral	by choice i '_ll never use them again .
neutral	i bought a phone neat xmas from the o0 shop in scunthorpe , and it was a nokia , only cost me about £_00 .
neutral	i wanted a new phone that looked new as my phone had become very damaged , and did not want to spend loads of money .
neutral	unfortunately after a stressful day at work only about two months after buying this phone , ( still in brilliant condition ) i dropped it down the toilet , and so it was classed_as non working to mazuma .
neutral	it did not work , and i dried it out for days and days so considered getting some money for it .
neutral	i was disappointed by the £ 0 non working price for my phone from mazuma , considering they would probably sell it onto somewhere_else and get a lot of profit for it .
neutral	the whole service from mazuma was quick and very easy .
neutral	it didnt take much just to pop down to the post box and put it in , and days_later i got my cheque .
neutral	the only_negative_thing i can think of is that you do not get enough money for your phone .
neutral	considering mine was two months old , and i only got 0 pound .
neutral	but overall fast service , very easy and i '_d do it again with other phones .
neutral	thanks mazuma
neutral	i ordered these flowers for my daughter for her_birthday as a surprise when i saw the flowers i was so shocked !!!
neutral	to think that i had sent these and they are 00_hours old i have purchesed flowers from the market and they knock the flowers you sent to here into fits i shall not be using you again .
neutral	i found the inks took longer to arrive than others i have ordered .
neutral	haven_'_t used
neutral	any yet .
neutral	still_waiting for my order
neutral	a double_buggy was ordered to make life_easier with taking the twin_boys out .
neutral	after a week of not hearing_anything , i checked the order to find they were awaiting stock - this was not shown when purchasing the twin stroller , nor a follow_up email to say .
neutral	foot_muffs were also bought , which were next_day delivery , but they didn_'_t arrive either ; they came in the same delivery as the stroller .
neutral	delivery was speedy .
neutral	but very disappointed as i was about to buy the boots at the reduce price of £_00 ( or_thereabouts ) but was going on hols so thought it best to order on my return so they weren_'_t sitting_around .
neutral	um !
neutral	two_weeks_later the product had gone up to £_000 !
neutral	confused !
neutral	bought a large order for a new_bathroom , which was delivered as promised and the quality is fantastic .
neutral	only quibble is that i was told different things by different customer service advisors and their advice cost me money !
neutral	when i complained they advised that staff were training , but offered no money back or discount for my problem .
neutral	whilst i understand these things_happen , the customer shouldnt lose out .
neutral	real_shame because the quality of the items ordered was outstanding and a couple of breakages were put right straight_away .
neutral	sadly customer service needs_improving but value for money was great .
neutral	she was on but never_heard anyone left on porch doorstep if i hadnt rung they would have been there all night . i did tick the be patient box .
neutral	i
neutral	villa was in a nice location .
neutral	downside was having to vacate at 00 in the morning as one of our party was disabled .
neutral	rang rep and asked if we could have late check out or another villa for the day as our flight was later that evening .
neutral	they informed me that they would be unable to assist with this and supplied me with the name of apartment in puerto_del carmen that we could leave our lugagge at or if available an apartment we could rent for the day .
neutral	obviously with a disabled_person the apartment was our only option and this cost us further taxi fees plus €_00 for the day for a less_than nice apartment .
neutral	after paying €_000 . 00 i felt the check out time was too early and that some additional accomodation should have been provided especially as we had to wait a day for a plumber to deal with a problem within the house .
neutral	i was happy with the villa but feel the check out time should be reviewed or alternative short_term accomodation should be provided .
neutral	i was very impressed with the easy process buying online and getting my items delivered ( next_day ) and within the agreed time frame .
neutral	unfortunately the quality of the hawaiian skirts that i bought was very poor .
neutral	they all came apart just by getting them out of the package .
neutral	other items were ok .
neutral	it cost me nearly_£_00 to try on the gillet so it '_s definitely put me off using or recommending this company in the future .
neutral	not much to sleep due to other guests noise .
neutral	receptionist not bothered .
neutral	breakfast was awful in the fact a bus arrived full of chinese people , who hoarded the buffet .
neutral	couldn_'_t get near for ages , then we had to rush .
neutral	also had to stand waiting for cooked items , including fried eggs , bacon , mushrooms and beans .
neutral	hi , i love the flowers from prestige but found the website frustrating and not very helpful .
neutral	i buy a lot online so am used to website purchasing , but i am sorry , the prestige one is not clear enough .
neutral	you need to put explanation in .
neutral	eg if you go straight to paypal , there is no chance to put in a discount_code - you have to go to secure checkout first and then choose paypal .
neutral	we online buyers are used to " click here " signs not " update ".... update what ?
neutral	i know , ask the teenage_son who may work it out , but i don_'_t want to .
neutral	look at argos , or rymans , they guide you through the buying process , not confuse you .
neutral	please take a look .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	as i have not seen the flowers myself , i can only comment on the service .
neutral	which was very good .
neutral	i have shopped with feedem three_times_now and this time two lots of treats i had bought for my pets were smashed up .
neutral	i complained to customer service who said they '_ll ask their couriers to be more careful in future !
neutral	not very impressed to be honest .
neutral	not a bad selection , pretty fast delivery .
neutral	seam was ripped a little on the outfit i purchased which was frustrating .
neutral	my wellies arrived quickly and they are lovely , but the box was quite squashed and damaged .
neutral	the wellies themselves were not damaged , but if i had bought them for a gift i would not have been happy with the state of the box !
neutral	do not use if buying a present for someone .
neutral	i got to know this website through amazon and was very fascinated about the website in that you can virtually get all you need to decorate your venue and even also the color themes gives one great ideas in decorating . prices do vary from item to item which in some cases are competitive but generally a good place to shop .
neutral	my only_disappointment is in the packaging of some of the fragile items . for instance the plastic cups i ordered were all broken on delivery and serviette papers were opened and scattered in the box . this was promptly resolved . delivery time was excellent and prompt .. would recommend to anyone but please_note that packaging of goods to customers are greatly_improved especially those with free delivery . thank_you
neutral	i was frustrated that although i was supposed to be able to track parcel the couriers site told me parcel had ' failed to deliver ' a day i was in all day waiting no one i called could help and then parcel arrived two_days_later
neutral	ordered at_least 00m over a period of a few_weeks .
neutral	delivery was delayed on all orders which held up the project .
neutral	the company is based in gloucester approx 0 miles from our site and we were last on the list for delivery on one order which was after 0 . oo p . m and the builders had gone home after waiting all day to complete the job !
neutral	the truck had been all the way to london for dropoffs and we were last on the list .
neutral	crazy , and not environmentally_friendly .
neutral	delivery guys were great .
neutral	worktops were lovely and look fantastic .
neutral	tele_sales were helpful but promised morning delivery and ended with afternoon slot .
neutral	i received the sample invitations as ordered and was happy with the quality , however wheni tried to order them on - line , a fault when putting the items in my shopping_basket made my internet browser close .
neutral	i tried to do this on several_occasions but have been unable to get as far as the shopping_basket .
neutral	not the colour really as shown and the material shiny due to blackout linings very good tie_backs prompt delivery would probably buy from them again
neutral	after putting my order through in the morning with specific instructions to where it had to go , my delivery was sent to a different part of the company ( at the other end of town ) after_speaking to customer_services , i was told if get a callback or an_email within 00_mins , as they were waiting on the driver returning .
neutral	this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	called the next_morning to be told the flowers had been signed for and we ' re being delivered internally that day .
neutral	same day didn_'_t happen and the surprise was ruined .
neutral	i '_m apparently getting refunded the delivery charge but this has yet to materialise .
neutral	i was severely disappointed , as i '_ve_used eflorist before and had no_problems what so ever .
neutral	i '_ll be hesitant to place another order because of this .
neutral	i ordered a gorgeous bunch of flowers including white anemones and sweet william .
neutral	..
neutral	very vintage , pale and striking .
neutral	i received an arrangement heavy on the gerberas and carnations in bright_pink , lime and white .
neutral	as i said .
neutral	..
neutral	very pretty , but not what i was looking for at all .
neutral	be aware that when they say they can substitute they apparently mean practically the entire arrangement .
neutral	ordered the trainers for my husband , all straight_forward .
neutral	received an e_- mail to advise me of delivery day and time but unfortunately i was out at work .
neutral	found a calling_card that had been left in my mail box advising me that the trainers had been left down the side of house .
neutral	i searched both_sides of my property and checked with the neighbours but unfortunately no trainers were found .
neutral	i contacted urban_industries to advise of the situation who i must_say we ' re very helpful and prompt with replies and they advised that they would investigate with the delivery company .
neutral	i then received an e_- mail that provided a proof of delivery with my surname on it , so i can only_assume that the driver has signed on my behalf and then left the package , otherwise he wouldn_'_t have left a card ?!
neutral	the whereabouts of the trainers are still a mystery , i have now been advised that they do not have any more stock of that size , so to say the least until this matter is resolved i '_m a little dissapointed & am still_awaiting a replacement or refund .
neutral	but no fault to urban_industries just the delivery company .
neutral	animed_direct themselves are a great company and sell animal products at reduced prices ( cheaper_than going to the vets )!
neutral	they have a very fast turnaround and despatch products via overnight courier .
neutral	the courier company are some of the rudest people i have ever met !
neutral	if you arent able to take delivery as arranged ( and to be frank how many of us are able to sit at home all day to wait for a pack of dog_chews )?
neutral	they make it very difficult to get your product and are frankly just obnoxious , rude and have no people skills at all .
neutral	not what you would expect from a courier service .
neutral	so animed please consider_using another company with people who are customer_focused like yourselves .
neutral	i ordered an a00 ankle_support as worn by andy_murray , for the right ankle size large , i received an a00 ankle_support for the left ankle size medium .
neutral	i had to make a trip on saturday_morning to the post_office in the town near the village where i live pick this up as i was out when it was delivered and had to be signed for , pay for parking etc only to find out it was the wrong one .
neutral	there was no returns_label included so i had to e_mail physio_room with my complaint and requested an exchange .
neutral	on a postive note physio_room replied the next worlking day apologising and sent an e_mail with a collect_+ returns_label so i was able to send it back free of charge .
neutral	i have purchased numerous items from very and have generally been pleased , however on this occasion i was very disappointed .
neutral	my order was delayed by almost three_weeks , and this was a time sensitive order as it was part of a birthday_present .
neutral	after_contacting very on a couple of occasions , i found the response to be less_than poor .
neutral	i was fobbed_off with a standard email template and when i spoke to customer service representative on the phone , they simply read the status of my order ; which was exactly the same as what i could see from my account .
neutral	no effort was made to investigate_further which i find unsatisfactory , especially when they themselves did not know what was causing the delay .
neutral	i was told the matter would be looked into and somebody would contact me shortly .
neutral	this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	finally my item arrived and it is only then i receive another email template from very , simply stating that if i have not received my order by a certain_date , i am to contact them again and they will investigate_further .
neutral	all_round a sub - standard service from very and i felt really let_down !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered my wormer a week_ago and it has still not arrived !
neutral	arranged for a delivery on friday between_0am - 0pm .
neutral	waited in all day .
neutral	still no delivery by 0 . 00pm so phoned tile_mountain who phoned back at 0pm to confirm that delivery would be before 0pm .
neutral	still no delivery .
neutral	had to cancel the tiler who was to lay the tiles on sat .
neutral	phoned tile_mountain on sat who stated that they could not understand_why delivery was not made and they were unable to contact the delivery co .
neutral	tile_mountain phoned my mobile at 00am mon and left message to say they were now being delivered which was no good because no one was in .
neutral	fortunately thanks to a kind neighbour across the rd persuaded the driver to leave them at my front_door and he signed for them .
neutral	ok the tiles are good but such a shame that the delivery service is not the same .
neutral	in this day and age everybody has a mobile and and it would be no problem to phone the receiver to inform of expected delivery time or indeed if he can '_t get there .
neutral	some communication is better_than none at all !!!
neutral	!
neutral	excellent , efficient delivery service , good packaging .
neutral	uninspiring card ; could have been prettier .
neutral	flowers were nice enough , but all in all , poor value for money as the bouquet was smaller_than_expected for the price paid .
neutral	it is difficult to tell online how the bouquet will look in real_life .
neutral	with hindsight , i should have bought 0 tesco_finest bunches and would have had a far more impressive bouquet to hand over at the special_occasion .
neutral	the blind arrived very quickly after ordering .
neutral	when we tried to put it up the chain on the winder was stuck in the mechanism .
neutral	it was quite hard to free it .
neutral	i am not totally happy with it as it appears to have been made back to front .
neutral	it might be that it is how it is supposed to be .
neutral	it gives me the privacy i needed in my bathroom .
neutral	i am very happy with the colour .
neutral	i ordered tulips for mothers_day and was very disappointed in the arrangement and the qaulity .
neutral	i duly complained and a replacement bouquet was send out to my mother professionally and without_fuss .
neutral	i have just ordered more tulips which arrived wednesday 0th_may .
neutral	they were dead by sunday 00th_may .
neutral	once agian dissapointed .
neutral	i have not complained again but will not be using clare_florist again as the quality of the flowers used appears to be below_par .
neutral	i must however point out that until these two incidents i have always been happy with the service and the quality .
neutral	not a very welcoming hotel recption .
neutral	screaming uncontrolled children everywhere .
neutral	long_queues to check in and slow . no apology from receptionist .
neutral	room was comfortable and quiet .
neutral	deal was good value with a weeks carparking at airport .
neutral	would use again as an overnight hotel before flying but for no other purpose
neutral	the problem is one blind came complete with everything including instructions but the other one had four screws_missing to attach the brackets and the saftey clip and fittings were missing altogether .
neutral	luckily i had some screws of my own to fit the blind .
neutral	im a bit disappointed .
neutral	good variety of restaurants available on the site , with some new entries that i can '_t find on any of their_competitors ' websites .
neutral	nothing special about the website as a whole .
neutral	they do offer some form of customer service ( which i haven_'_t tried ), but they take no responsibility for actually getting the food out to you .
neutral	can '_t see the functionality to store favourites , card_details , etc_., which would be good for repeat_orders .
neutral	worth a visit though .
neutral	cost wise it is a good value product and therefore you get what you pay for
neutral	very quick delivery but not sure of effectiveness .
neutral	ordered romax , rat and mouse killer , comes as prepacked paste sachets and includes gloves and trays which is convenient and causes no mess .
neutral	positioned it where i saw a mouse but so far no evidence even of tiny nibbles !
neutral	maybe mice don_'_t like it which is disappointing .
neutral	i would use this company again , they have a very large choice of products , delivery was fast , well_packaged and discreet .
neutral	0 of the 0 batteries did not work .
neutral	i did not return them as i had thrown the packaging away and couldn_'_t remember who i had bought them from .
neutral	i '_m_sure they would have replaced them if i had got in touch .
neutral	here is my letter to hammonds sent 0_weeks_ago - still no reply or even acknowledgement , also no allen_key which was apparently posted 0_weeks_ago as the senior fitter refused to give it to me !!
neutral	!
neutral	we write to complain regarding the above order of bedroom_furniture taken by your designer , john fox on 00th_january .
neutral	a surveyor ( lee ) checked the order and measurements on 00th_january and installation was booked for 00th and 00th_february_0000 .
neutral	we expressed concern at the short_notice and were advised that hammonds required seven_days ’ notice of cancellation .
neutral	despite the shortage of time to decorate the room in readiness for the installation , we complied and were ready for the fitter , lee falconer to commence work when he arrived at 0am .
neutral	on wednesday 00th , i overheard lee contact his manager as he was concerned straightaway about the position of the main light switch , something which was raised with the surveyor as i was worried that john fox had not taken this into_consideration in his design .
neutral	the manager told lee the company would pay for electrical works to move the switch , however , lee managed to get around this although the wardrobe_doors overlap more than they should .
neutral	we would not have wanted the switch moved as this would have ruined the decorating already undertaken .
neutral	lee also advised me that the internal brackets had not been delivered but should arrive the following_day – at no time were we advised of this in_advance by hammonds .
neutral	furthermore the internal floor panels promised by the designer had not been ordered .
neutral	at around 0pm that day it transpired_that the internal brackets would not arrive the following_day and since customer service closed at 0pm i was unable to ascertain when the delivery would be made .
neutral	by this time it was too late to contact my husband who had the thursday booked as leave , a complete_waste of a day ’_s holiday .
neutral	lee could not complete the works as booked and was most apologetic – i completed his paperwork accordingly before he departed .
neutral	despite my request for hammonds to contact me first thing thursday_morning with an explanation of what was happening , i was not contacted until late morning only to be told that the bedroom_furniture could not be completed until the following thursday ( 00th ).
neutral	i have therefore had to take additional leave .
neutral	to cap it all , i received a text on monday 00th stating that hammonds would be delivering the furniture on tuesday 00th before 00am .
neutral	i telephoned customer_services at 0 . 00 to rearrange as this was inconvenient but never received the promised call back and had to telephone yet again at 0 . 00 to find out what was going on !
neutral	i was told that the order would be delivered to a fitter who would in turn deliver it to our fitter who was due come on thursday 00th – only for a box of parts to be delivered to me on wednesday 00th .
neutral	i was then told that a senior fitter , wally , had been booked for thursday 00th who would handle the remaining fitting and ensure i was completely_satisfied with the furniture .
neutral	despite_being ready to receive wally at 0am , he had not arrived by 0 . 00am .
neutral	when i telephoned to enquire where he was i was told the appointment was been 0 and 00am – this does not appear very efficient , if a fitter does not arrive until 00am half the day is gone !
neutral	wally arrived at 0 . 00am , when i said i expected him earlier he complained he had to come from luton .
neutral	i asked him not to cut the wood_flooring in the bedroom as it would create additional mess on freshly painted surfaces and instead do it in the garage however he insisted he had to do it in the bedroom as he couldn ’_t keep_up and down the stairs but agreed to my request that he clear up at the end of the day .
neutral	just before 0pm ( lee had said he would have done the whole job in one day if all the parts were available ) wally told me he had finished and i could take a look .
neutral	i immediately saw an area he had not masticked which i asked him to correct , the units were left very dusty , lee spent a long time cleaning all the units at the end of his day despite knowing they were not complete .
neutral	the floor and walls were also covered in dust .
neutral	i then asked wally if he would show me with the allen_key how to adjust the shelves and rails as he had only pointed to the fixings and i wanted to be sure exactly how they worked .
neutral	he abruptly stated :” i ’ ve had enough of you today , you can deal with the office ”.
neutral	i was very shocked as this was said in front of myself and my 00 year_old_son , all i could say in return was , “ how rude ”.
neutral	wally departed in such a hurry he failed to get me to complete any paperwork .
neutral	i immediately telephoned customer_services and spoke to clare caswell who was quite sympathetic and said i should not have been spoken to in such a way in my own_home .
neutral	she promised to call me back the next_day once she had a chance to contact wally ’_s manager .
neutral	this clare duly did , however , she told me the director was not available to approve compensation and she would call me at 00am on monday .
neutral	clare eventually called me at 0 . 00pm on monday to offer me a measly_£_000 as a “ goodwill_gesture ”.
neutral	i turned down this offer flat as it was not adequate recompense for all the inconvenience and stress suffered when we had committed to spend £ 0 , 000 with your company .
neutral	clare indicated this was a one time offer and if i wanted to take it further to contact the furniture ombudsman .
neutral	i then googled hammonds customer reviews – so many complaints along similar lines .
neutral	as previously mentioned , my husband lost a day ’_s holiday from work which i understand you usually compensate with £_00 , i had to take an additional day ’_s leave so what do we get for the downright rudeness of your employee wally and the incompetence of your surveyor ?
neutral	had we cancelled with less_than seven_days ’ notice we would have been penalised £_000 .
neutral	sadly our experience of your company ( with the notable exception of lee falconer ) has_been a catalogue of errors and extremely poor customer service .
neutral	hammonds insisted on seven_days ’ notice of cancellation yet have made eleventh_hour changes to arrangements twice causing us great inconvenience and stress .
neutral	we have waited six years for the bedroom of our dreams which has_become a nightmare thanks to the incompetence of your company .
neutral	we look_forward to receiving a dramatically improved offer of compensation from yourselves at your earliest convenience .
neutral	in summary , i wish i had visited this site before i booked my furniture .
neutral	my advice - go elsewhere and don_'_t touch hammonds with a barge_pole !!
neutral	!
neutral	i tried to order recently twice on line and pay using paypal however for some reason the order was not processed even_though i am a frequent user of paypal .
neutral	i phoned pet_prescription in the end as my dog had run_out of tablets and i was getting concerned .
neutral	despite saying i could have a worming_treatment at the offer price i thought i was paying previously however this was not the case and i ended_up paying more .
neutral	i was also disappointed that pet_prescription started to charge postage & packing , i don_'_t think they are as competitively_priced as they used to be .
neutral	i bought the christmas festive basket and sympathy flower_basket , i upgraded both to the medium_size , both costing_£_00 . 00 plus delivery .
neutral	neither lived_up the pictures on the internet , some of the leaves on the festive basket were dry and curling on the day they were delivered and within 0_days the flowers were drooping despite the oasis being watered and the flowers sprayed with water .
neutral	the sympathy basket looked bare and was real disappointment , would i order from e_florist again absolutely not , i feel the arrangements were overpriced and poor quality .
neutral	on the day the flowers were delivered i was out and my husband accepted them , if i had been in i would have asked for a refund and declined the delivery .
neutral	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
neutral	i decided to not send the outfit back for an exchange as i was unsure if i would receive the replacement in time for when i needed it .
neutral	i do not fault the service and delivery but disappointing that the outfit was faulty when it arrived .
neutral	lynsey thomas
neutral	flowers were not what i expected not as many sprays as i thought , the roses in the bouquet only lasted a few hours before they drooped
neutral	i am severely disappointed with having had £ 0 . 00 of postage subtracted from my refund .
neutral	this seems to have been brought in september_0000 .
neutral	i recently ordered two different products in different_styles but in my normal size .
neutral	one pair shoes fitted brilliantly and the short boots were too narrow at the heel .
neutral	so i sent them back and ordered another pair of boots in the same style as the shoes and they fitted fine .
neutral	then an_email arrived about the pair i returned and £ 0 . 00 had been deducted for postage .
neutral	i think this is outrageous , as some styles obviously fit better_than others .
neutral	i had read the reviews about each otf the products and basically they were very similar and obviously didn_'_t give much clue as to what would fit my feet and what wouldn_'_t .
neutral	i do not live on mainland britain so the chances of me getting to a shop are nonexistent .
neutral	i do not think i will use ecco again , as i am penalised for having to use internet_shopping not out of choice but necessity .
neutral	also in total the amout i spent on the satisfactory foot wear was over_£_000 . 00 .
neutral	my very elderly friend was delighted with her flowers - but she would not have received them had it not been for her neighbour , who took them in for her when they were thoughtlessly left on the doorstep by the delivery person .
neutral	this annoys_me because i specifically_requested that the delivery person knock_loudly and wait a long time as the lady in question is 00 and takes a long time to get the door .
neutral	it was just as well her neighbour saw them sitting there or she would have lost her flowers !
neutral	this puts me off using your service again despite the flowers , which were very nice indeed !
neutral	i contacted physioroom to identify which size thumb_brace i need and was advised that i was between a small and medium .
neutral	the advice was to go for the larger_size .
neutral	unfortunately it means that my thumb is nearly lost in the support because it is too long , might have been better with a small , also the velcro around the thumb cuts a bit into the tissue where my thumb joins my hand .
neutral	i have made it a bit more comfortable by trimming out a piece on the velcro but this isn_'_t a comfortable fit .
neutral	might buy a second one and try a small .
neutral	i think the principle of the support is good just need to get the sizing right .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because technically i cannot use their on - line shopping facility .
neutral	the site will not accept my passwords , and their is no tesco store around the area i live , the nearest one being 00 miles_away .
neutral	i love this jumper .
neutral	it '_s such a shame that super_dry are renown for being small in their sizing .
neutral	or that they could do a x large !!
neutral	!
neutral	product good and at a reasonable_price but delivery was too slow and there was no communication for 0_days so i wondered_if the order had been lost .
neutral	some shops don_'_t seem to no anything about quid co so i am losing a lot of money and sometimes no reception in stores debermans seems to be the only one that am getting discount on think we need a bit more explanation on how to use this service
neutral	good price but watch out for the extras they add on to up the price .
neutral	i even unchecked the boxes and was still charged for them .
neutral	i found the quality of some of the pictures not as good as others .
neutral	this had nothing to do with the lighting because they were of the same picture different pose taken virtually one after the other .
neutral	on one picture the groom looked almost grey .
neutral	i bought this as a surprise for my son and have to admit that although some of the pictures were very good in colouring , others were not .
neutral	so i found it a little_disappointing in that respect , although the actual book was lovely and the cover was excellent .
neutral	the item arrived a day late as it missed her_birthday and she thought that i had forgotten it was not a good start , if you had let_me know then i could have told her to expect something the next_day .
neutral	as it was they were left on her front_doorstep and she was in the garden at the time so they did not try very hard to deliver them in person to her .
neutral	the item was not the freesia bunch which i had ordered it was important as my mother for whom they were sent to has failing sight and the fragrance is why i chose them .
neutral	i saw the bunch a few_days_later and was not impressed very ordinary not like the usual bouquets i have sent to her from you in the past .
neutral	easy to order , quick to arrive i had to change the delivery date which was easy to do
neutral	the downside is one of my items was non sale and over_£_00 however i didn_'_t receive a free gift as stated on the website .
neutral	i waited for the item to arrive but it never turned_up .
neutral	however , when i rang the office to ask where it was they said that they were sorry and refunded me my money with no questions_asked which i was plesently suprised .
neutral	pleased with delivery time and communication .
neutral	less pleased with shoes not being the same as those in the picture on the website .
neutral	according to t '_s & c '_s the company reserves the right to change item specifications without warning ...
neutral	ive only used the gel for 0_days so hard to say if i will feel any benefit from it , but as it states on the box , one tube will last one week , so cannot_afford to continue buying it .
neutral	have had a word with my practitioner , but it cant be obtained on prescription .
neutral	walls and floors were good to deal with and were very good value for money .
neutral	a few hiccups_along the way though .
neutral	i ordered 0 sample_tiles , only received 0 having been charged for 0 and when they arrived , they were all broken .
neutral	having placed order , i received a call to say that some of the tiles weren_'_t in stock which wasn_'_t a major disaster as they were due in the following week .
neutral	main disappointment was that i was given delivery date and had tiler booked to take in delivery and get on with job , however , on the afternoon of the delivery day , i received a call from the delivery company to say that ' their van had broken down ' ( how often do we hear that ?!)
neutral	and that it would be the following_day before delivery was made .
neutral	i asked if it would be possible to have an early delivery as i had tiler booked but advised that this wouldn_'_t be possible .
neutral	i appreciate that this isn_'_t walls and floors fault but it does impact on the customer '_s overall opinion of the company .
neutral	the prices are competative , however the site is not the easiest to use .
neutral	it seems a little tempermental when choosing an item / quantity and paying for goods .
neutral	its very jumpy .
neutral	delivery good .
neutral	everyone i have spoken to has_been incredibly helpful & friendly .
neutral	i can '_t fault them .
neutral	the bit i '_m really very disappointed about is that the products arrive in boxes & i '_m expected to unpack them myself .
neutral	these are heavy oak pieces of furniture & i was a woman on my own .
neutral	i '_m_sure this is detailed somewhere in the small_print but i certainly wasn_'_t prepared for it .
neutral	i '_m pleased with the quality of the products for the price i have paid & love the interest free credit .
neutral	the food choices are great but so far not lost any weight .
neutral	but il keep at it for a few more weeks .
neutral	the diet_chef team are great and as i said the meals are delicious and very filling
neutral	i wanted to reply to a comment that was put on my review and i have been unable to do this unless i log_into facebook .
neutral	i don_'_t want to do this and i cannot see any other way to comment back
neutral	delivery paid for next_day delivery which would mean the phone arrived on friday , however the phone arrived on monday which was too late for our new starter
neutral	fast service however just left on doorstep
neutral	the whole_process was easy to buy but i did not hear_anything about delivery after a few_days i contacted the sunglasses_shop about this and they said it will be delivered tomorrow .
neutral	i then got a conflicting email_saying they were out of stock when i questioned this they said this was true but when i went on to the website and via other website such as amazon they said they were still in stock and at a cheaper price .
neutral	the response i got was it could take up to 00 days for them to be back in stock .
neutral	they were sent to me in less 00 days and the glasses are great .
neutral	having had glasses re - glazed by glasses_direct a couple of years_ago , i was disappointed to find that they now charge for postage to return them to the lab & to send them back to me .
neutral	i was also puzzled as to why they returned some ( but not all ) of my old lenses .
neutral	why do i choose a re - glaze , rather_than new frames ?
neutral	mainly_because their prices have gone up sooo_much since i got my first pair & also because they ' re now very much into designer names frames :-( rather_than good basic frames at good basic prices !
neutral	order not complete so i have to return most items as they were a set as a gift .
neutral	i ordered 0 coffee machines and only one arrived .
neutral	i had to call the company to chase the order and it wasnt till then that they told me the other one was out of stock .
neutral	i had to change the colour and re - order to make_sure i got one before christmas .
neutral	once this was done it arrived quickly but i wouldnt have ordered from them if i knew they didnt have stock .
neutral	my first purchase was a black knitted dress from the site , the dress came in the post in a couple of days , very good delivery service !
neutral	however when i opended the parcel the dress was crumpled up in a plastic_bag inside and the material felt very cheap !
neutral	the fit was not very flattering and i felt that i could have bought the dress much_cheaper with a better quality at a shop like primark !
neutral	the hasstle of returning the package to a collection shop and filling in the forms meant that i have ended_up keeping it !
neutral	i think the return_policy should be longer .
neutral	i would be wary of purchasing from the site again as my dress looked a lot better on the site , and for a garment that is so simple to get right i would be afraid to get anything_else !
neutral	i ordered three products from the website which are currently being promoted on facebook ( calorie free spreads ).
neutral	all of them taste horrendous and were a complete_waste of money .
neutral	of course foods are a question of taste but i cannot conceive that anyone would find these chemical , hyper saccharin tasting products nice to consume .
neutral	have used this website before - no_problems .
neutral	bought some beautiful orchids for my mum '_s birthday - great value and the flowers were stunning .
neutral	despite ordering them last_week they were delivered on the day but at 0pm !
neutral	rather late - my poor mum thought we had forgotten her .
neutral	very disappointed !
neutral	good website fast delivery .
neutral	but sash '_s split after one wear .
neutral	poor quality
neutral	when i was googling the product i was looking for ' chemistdirect ' came up and seemed to be cheaper_than everybody else .
neutral	at first i thought brilliant !
neutral	as it was a christmas gift ..
neutral	however , when the product arrived the box was extremely damaged and i was very unhappy !!!
neutral	they had no intentions of resolving my issue either !
neutral	i received my package on time however the packaging for the fragrance i bought was partially opened , wrinkled and damaged .
neutral	the item was bought as a present to someone_else , which makes it even more disappointing .
neutral	i had ordered the bottom draw for my fridge_/_freezer .
neutral	when it arrived there was no lid .
neutral	i assumed for that price of £_00 ( incl delivery ) the lid for the drawer was included .
neutral	both the box and lid had been broken by my son accidently .
neutral	i cannot see the lid separately on your listing .
neutral	your comments would be appreciated
neutral	thank_you
neutral	platform is well_designed and easy to use , but i finding it frustrating if you get stuck , then customer service is not the greatest , especially using support email .
neutral	it '_s not helpful either when you have to call 0000 number !!
neutral	!
neutral	tenants can '_t find upload documents section , so they have to email separately .
neutral	i ordered wrong products and wanted to exchange .
neutral	i wrote to customer service but never got answer from them .
neutral	had to purchase again .
neutral	we have been dealing_with mdp for around 0 years and we have experienced many issues with them over the years .
neutral	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately .. often the products are wrong , aren_'_t included , wrong sizes etc ..
neutral	but i do have to say they always sort the problems quickly and at their own cost .
neutral	parcels often arrive damaged , which you could put down to the delivery company or the thin boxes that are used .
neutral	we have tried to find other_companies who have an order process as easy as theirs but nothing_compares at all ( including on price ) so we just stick with them and deal with the mistakes .
neutral	quick delivery , good value
neutral	thrilled that i can order my favourite items , but so dissapointed by the continued delayed delivery .
neutral	now expected at the end of january !
neutral	ordered wii and games got the games 0_days before the wii so lucky i purchased before birthday
neutral	tina , leeds
neutral	i have been disappointed with the length of time it takes to be paid larger_amounts of cash_back .
neutral	for the last two years i have purchased my home insurance through_topcashback .
neutral	it took nearly a year for the cash_back to be paid the first year , much longer_than the tracking statistics would suggest .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the cash_back for my home insurance purchase for last_year after_submitting a cash_back claim and sending regular nudges .
neutral	i now in the process of renewing my home insurance again and have no_intention of purchasing it through_topcashback .
neutral	always order at xmas and usually received within 0_days .
neutral	this year took nearly 0_weeks .
neutral	did raise concerns but not as helpful as in previous years .
neutral	daily_sparkle is a good tool for reminiscence and can be engaging , it would be nice to bring it to life more , maybe put grannies old time recipes in for us to make on a weekly_basis .
neutral	the dvd is very good to especially the dance and comedy aspects . could it have carers notes to accompany it please as the one for the magazine is very helpful .
neutral	thank_you for your hard_work , keep it going
neutral	my goods took over two_weeks to be delivered .
neutral	i had no notification of delivery date and so was out at first_attempt - this was 00 days after order was made .
neutral	second delivery had to be 0_days_later .
neutral	i find this unacceptable , especially from a company like aspinal .
neutral	the products are such very good quality but the delivery process lets the company down_badly .
neutral	i ordered this christmas bouquet for my mother but when she received them the card was blank so she had to start ringing around asking who they were from which ruined the whole sentiment .
neutral	i was very disappointed and would not order from this company again !
neutral	i knew what i wanted from indigo_herbs before i went on the website , however i was surprised at the cost of postage and packing and felt that the 00_%_off was a catch as you had to purchase the set amount .
neutral	not easy to navigate_around
neutral	i found it slow and difficult to book flights on your site .
neutral	sales_team very helpful , although you feel as if you are constantly being watched .
neutral	would like to have had more choice in 0x0 only about 0 / 0 there .
neutral	collecting the car was frustrating , collection time was 00am didn_'_t get seen straight way , hard going when you have children with you .
neutral	ordered a couple of plastic bibs for my toddler as she '_s now feeding herself and making a bigger mess .
neutral	ordering process good , price good , delivery time good however one of the bibs is cracked and my husband has thrown_away packaging so cannot return .
neutral	ordered on monday didn_'_t receive until saturday .
neutral	the quality of the goods ordered was unacceptable and they were taken back
neutral	for a refund and i then discovered that the goods were in fact from argos .........
neutral	i had no idea that homebase and argos were the same company .
neutral	the goods were
neutral	not recognised on the homebase computer , but was sorted_out in store and a
neutral	refund obtained , although i was a bit_miffed that i had paid £ 0 . 00 for postage and
neutral	packing which was non_refundable even_though the goods were not up to standard .
neutral	unlike a friend of mine ( who i recommended to happy puzzles & spent a lot less_than i did with you ), i didn_'_t receive any special_offers or discounts by email - until after my second order which obviously cost me a lot more than it should have done if i '_d received the discount_code .
neutral	this has left me with a bad feeling & less likely to do_business with you in future .
neutral	use infrequently and due to this account expired but was still held i was just unable to access .
neutral	so i had to open another account due to the time passed but could not with my original email address so had to open a second alternative email to do this , which was not a major problem except for me because i am not conversant with the computer as others .
neutral	so far the ' sellers ' from whom i have purchased have been excellent and i therefore would say the experience will invite me to browse and purchase via_ebay again .
neutral	payment is easy to process and so it is just the difficulty of accessing one '_s account that remains a problem at times and not finding help to resplve this easily found .
neutral	shopping at littlewoods has_been been a pleasure although i do tend to shop for the ' home ' or ' gifts '.
neutral	often find what i want that i am unable to find elsewhere .
neutral	whilst generally the quality of item is value for money , sometimes i find prices not as comparable to elsewhere as i would like so that would give me pause for consideration before i buy .
neutral	rarely if ever have i had to complain .
neutral	i predominently browse online but prefer to order and pay per telephone from where i find the process easy .
neutral	customer service is fast and pleasantly polite & helpful but i cannot_afford to purchase too much at one time being inhibited by income .
neutral	however to date i have returned to purchase from littlewoods with confidence .
neutral	i booked online for a 0am pick_up , phoned at 0 . 00 to say i was 00mins_away , at 0 . 00 i phoned to ask where they were !
neutral	informed guy has just left with paperwork and be with me in 00mins ....
neutral	00_mins later no sign , phoned again was told they had no record of me making the reservation , i can forward the email , eventually at 0am my car was collected .
neutral	the product is good , although it is available cheaper elsewhere , and the delivery was quick .
neutral	but it came with no instructions or leaflet with basic exercises which was disappointing ( i note that many other_sites all supply this with their product ).
neutral	the item is sold as adjustable but without instructions i have no idea how it works .
neutral	when i contacted customer_services i was told they do not have pdf copies of instructions which i find extremely poor ( how hard is it to type up some basic instructions and either photocopy and include with the goods , or scan and send in an_email when requested ?).
neutral	i was told i could call customer_services and someone would talk me through it !
neutral	although primark is good and carries a lot of stuff and at good prices , sometimes the quality of the items is a bit_iffy , for instance , i bought 0 pairs of shoes ( womens ) at £_00 each , and they only lasted one season , i was not wearing them every day either , the heels wore down quickly and they got very scruffy looking very quickly .
neutral	one pair , the dye even ran onto my feet when it rained .
neutral	also some of the clothes sizes and styles are odd and it is best to try on stuff first to make_sure it ' hangs ' right , otherwise it is not a case of ' one size fits all ' as some stuff just doesn_'_t look right even_though it looks good on the hanger !
neutral	we have a questionable credit_rating and would never have been able to get a car on fianance elsewhere .... overall i was pleased with the service at tcw ... we were left to view the cars on our own and nathan held back .... this is great in a way but the cars have no details on them so if u are clueless like i am you have to ask ... eg is it diesel ... engine size etc ..... make_sure you inspect your car as anything you want fixed will not be done unless it '_s on the " job sheet " before you leave .... to be fair i now have a beautiful fiesta that i love ( with a wing_mirror that tcw are going to fix as it was on the job sheet ) and we would never have had that without cancan and tcw .... monthly payment is great interest_rate is great so i '_m a happy girl !
neutral	driver 00mins late on pick_up from home .
neutral	had i not built in extra time for duty_free shopping i would have missed flight .
neutral	early on pick_up from airport .
neutral	i placed an order and received confirmation followed_by prompt delivery but only of partial order .
neutral	no info given prior to delivery that the largest part of the order would not be available until later in the month .
neutral	i would ave preferred to know up front that key items were out of stock .
neutral	i upgraded from small to medium bouquet .
neutral	if that was medium i really wouldn_'_t like to see the size of the small !!
neutral	the photo is very misleading and i assume it '_s of the large bouquet .
neutral	also some of the flowers have only lasted 0_days , which is disappointing .
neutral	the royal_mail nearly let us down but it worked out in the end ....
neutral	everyone loves superdry , but ...
neutral	if you buy from the website you can apply for a refund but only if you return those products via post .
neutral	if you buy through store you cannot have a refund only an exchange .
neutral	if they had a proper refund policy i am sure their sales would increase .
neutral	timing is crucial .
neutral	almost every time i had to call to find out the status of transaction .
neutral	in fact , the whole_process could be shortened by reacting quickly , especially when i mentioned i expected the funds to arrive before a certain_date ( deadline ).
neutral	the service was brilliant . but the glasses i ordered after losing my glasses from vision_express with the same prescription are not as strong so not enjoying reading as much because its a bit of a strain .
neutral	so i will go back to vision_express and use the glasses from yourselves as emergency ones
neutral	quick delivery , order sent out by different shops .
neutral	some dvd '_s of good quality , but found most of them dirty , scratched and some of the dvd '_s contained wrong disc .
neutral	latest problem , 0 disc set only had 0 disc in it .
neutral	overall i would rate 0 / 00
neutral	i think that the jokers ' masquerade got something wrong because i didn_'_t receive an item i ordered from them .
neutral	now i don_'_t know what to do .
neutral	shall i contact them ?
neutral	the service was fine & delivered in good time however ... the flowers were sparse didn_'_t even fill a vase .
neutral	i think my sister was happier with the gesture father than the actual flowers .
neutral	the directions to the drop_off point were awful - it said go to departures - and there were no signs whatsoever for departures so we drove right through the airport .
neutral	we phoned for further directions and were then able to drop the car off ok . coming_back it isn_'_t meet and greet .
neutral	we had to wait about 00_minutes for our car to be returned .
neutral	it was very expensive for a service like this
neutral	had a issue with a parcel that the courier delivered wrong , i never got the item and after numerous_calls to their 0000 number and explaining the issue over and over again ...
neutral	i then get a letter telling_me that next time if i don_'_t keep the returns tracking_number then i will be charged for the items , i requested that someone ring me regarding this on their contact us page , but no one wants to speak to me in person , i have tried to get the money for the £ 0 of calls made to them for the missing parcels but every time i send them information they want something_else or they want it in a different format ... all so i will get fed_up and give up trying to get the money back ...
neutral	up until now i had not had any_issues with very ... but i am very dissapointed that the customer service manager would not contact me herself ... some customer service that is ....
neutral	and if anyone at very reads this then they are more than welcome to contact me by phone ... but i doubt that it will be endless emails and letters rather_than at talk to me .
neutral	as above .
neutral	great site to navigate easy and very user_friendly .
neutral	would recommend .
neutral	buying the flowers on line was very straight_forward , delivery was free and prompt ( the next_day ) plenty of offers and discounts on the site .
neutral	when the flowers arrived they looked beautiful and fresh well preserved .
neutral	my only_disappointment was that i paid_extra to make them bigger and the basket looked quiet small for the price .
neutral	although the website said my order was in stock and ready to dispatch it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	i had to phone to be told that part of my order actually wasn_'_t in stock and they '_d send it all when it arrived - they could send in two parts but would charge me extra postage .
neutral	it would gave been useful to be given accurate info in the first place and also emailed with updates .
neutral	i '_ll continue to use the company as goods are good quality and price and service usually reliable .
neutral	if this happens again i '_ll rethink .
neutral	enjoy family feud immensely .
neutral	don_'_t like the constant pop - ups on bottom right corner .
neutral	would like to half game site , so i can do other things while i play .
neutral	others allow this .
neutral	badly packed products , jammed into a box far too small meaning products are damaged
neutral	ordering is simple and delivery super_fast .
neutral	i ordered 0 jumsuits both same size just different_colours .
neutral	one was too_big and the other too small even_though they were labelled the same size .
neutral	i ordered a size 00 bikini .
neutral	on arrival the top was a 00 and the bottoms a 00 .
neutral	however the sweater i ordered was just perfect .
neutral	overall , the transaction was good .
neutral	there is no unnecessary hassle .
neutral	my queries were answered within a day or so .
neutral	the transaction went pretty smoothly and i like it that i was informed of the remittance date , so that i don_'_t have to keep checking until then .
neutral	however , i was advised by your company that i should send my phone using special delivery , but you didn_'_t make it clear to me that you wouldn_'_t pay for it .
neutral	you should have said in the first place .
neutral	also , the selling and buying of iphones is so common .
neutral	the pre_- paid delivery should have been accounted for it .
neutral	i will most certainly look for sellers who do genuinely pay for the delivery next time i sell ( my iphone_0s ).
neutral	good prices given but took_ages to receive the phone and too many emails were sent saying they hadn_'_t received it .
neutral	overall not bad
neutral	if you say 0 - 00 delivery you should adhere to it , i didn_'_t get any notice of delay until too late , was embarrassed had to rearrange fit date with my customer at my cost , felt quite unprofessional
neutral	product arrived quickly .
neutral	that was the good part .
neutral	i have only rated the company 0_stars though and that is probably generous because they sent me rubbish instructions with what i ordered and when i emailed and emailed them to find out how i use what i purchased , i just didnt get anywhere with them .
neutral	they did reply to my emails , but didnt ever answer my query or try and help me .
neutral	they just kept on saying the same thing which was no use to me whatsoever .
neutral	plain simple instructions isnt too much to ask for is it ?
neutral	it took me 0_days to work out how to use what i bought .
neutral	my husband couldnt understand what they sent us either .
neutral	i very nearly gave up and sent it back !!
neutral	!
neutral	wall and tiles have a very good display of tiles sorted_out in colours makes it easy for u to decide what u would like .
neutral	shame about the delivery service 0 box '_s broken on arrival .
neutral	and telephone girl was not very helpful about replacement delivery
neutral	the product i require for my condition is purchased at a cheaper price at chemist_direct .
neutral	the service is fast , affordable , reliable .
neutral	however , as the medication is limited to two per_month , the delivery charge doesn_'_t really make it that much more worthwhile .
neutral	the packaging that the items come in is a bit of a joke .
neutral	i have two small pkts of 0 tablet .
neutral	the box is far too_big and full of unecessary paper .
neutral	i think this is a waste .
neutral	i have not yet worn the garment but it seems to be as ordered .
neutral	disappointed that i had to pay the carriage_costs of £_00 on returning an item that proved too heavy to use .
neutral	i expected to return the item free of charge ..
neutral	i underwent lasek laser_eye_surgery in march_0000 at shaftesbury avenue , london .
neutral	although i am pleased with the outcome , i feel that i am just a number in a production line and not a particularly valued_customer .
neutral	the surgery in london was packed and it was one in one out .
neutral	there were delays when i returned the following_day for my check up and had to wait over an_hour to see the optician .
neutral	my appointment had already been booked , but there were others who were going for their first consultation who appeared to be treated with more priority .
neutral	there weren_'_t even enough seats for everyone and not enough staff to cover .
neutral	i chose optical_express specifically over the other_companies , as they were opening a new branch in eastbourne where i live .
neutral	this was opened shortly_after i had surgery .
neutral	however , it is only open now on a tuesday and it is almost_impossible to get a check up appointment .
neutral	i rang to book for 00 dec and was told that no optician was available that day and i would need to book another day .
neutral	however , all other dates in dec were already booked up .
neutral	i presume by new potential_customers ... who are obviously more important , as they are generating more money .
neutral	also , it is impossible to book an_appointment any further ahead than 0_weeks as their computer_systems can '_t cope with this .
neutral	i feel so let_down by the very poor aftercare service in eastbourne and don_'_t want to travel to brighton for this .
neutral	you would think a company which is making £ millions from customers would be able to afford high_quality staff , a high_quality computer system and high_quality aftercare !!
neutral	!
neutral	as i said the only_thing i was disappointed with was the postage .
neutral	apart_from that o . k
neutral	no problem with argus_car_hire but fire fly car_hire in malaga we ' re not very good .
neutral	you have to wait for a long time ( 0 and a half hours ) in the underground car_park at the airport .
neutral	there was not enough seating for all the customers so people we ' re standing around in the road .
neutral	it was very dangerous .
neutral	we went in april so it wasn_'_t too hot in the car_park .
neutral	i should imagine the heat in the car_park will be unbearable in the summer .
neutral	there is also lots of add_ons to the cost , in out case the final price was five times that quoted on argus .
neutral	on the plus_side the member of staff that dealt_with my car was very quick , but things like cdw excess were automatically_added to the cost without even asking us .
neutral	we were so desperate to get out of there , we didn_'_t query it .
neutral	would use again .
neutral	i found this project reasonably easy to carry out .
neutral	the first page was daunting but i did work it out reasonably quickly .
neutral	once it was submitted the process was very quick to be sent to me .
neutral	i have one quibble .
neutral	i wanted to send the book to france but the company could not accomodate this .
neutral	instead i paid the £ 0 . 00 postage to uk then a further £ 0 . 00 to send it to france .
neutral	i was willing to pay the excess postage which would have saved about 0_days in the process
neutral	was easy to use , good website with lots of choice and product was a bounty_offer so very good value for money my only_negative is the very expensive delivery charge would definitely put me off using the site again and only i was getting such a good discount on the item i probably_wouldn_'_t have paid it i '_d have looked elsewhere .
neutral	can '_t fault the service i got tho .
neutral	only to find the next_day lunchtime is as i imagined next_day not in fact only when you order lenses into your stock
neutral	have bought products from chemist_direct as they have what i need but the trouble is the space / name for the delivery address
neutral	i have spoken to chemist_direct many_times over the fact that they miss off either the company name or my name or get the 0 mixed up together . recently a delivery address was made up of the first company name and my surname !!??
neutral	i have tried to explain and also have tried to amend so as the delivery driver knows where and who it is to be delivered to but chemist_direct still seem to muck it up ?
neutral	why can '_t they get the two correct ?
neutral	please check and double_check before you proceed with ordering that chemist_direct have your details right
neutral	i ordered lenses and paid_extra for express delivery by 0pm next_day as i was going on holiday .
neutral	my lenses didn_'_t arrive so i had to go i holiday with my glasses which i hate doing .
neutral	i '_m disappointed so wouldn_'_t recommend for that reason .
neutral	sorry
neutral	flowers were pretty and good updates with deliveries .
neutral	however , the delivery was made without the card and message .
neutral	so the recipient of the flowers had no idea who they were from which was very disappointing
neutral	i rang at the alloted_time but at the airport had to wait 00_mins in the rain for the chap meeting us to arrive .
neutral	not really that cheap anymore
neutral	i find them as expensive as asda tesco newlook .
neutral	so no more prida
neutral	your paying the price
neutral	shops are always in a mess
neutral	a really good site which provides lovely cards and fast postage .
neutral	however it does lack variety compared to its competitors for eg .
neutral	new home , auntie etc ...
neutral	parking was fine going out all though it was further than we would have liked , but coming_back was not so good we were waiting at bus_stop with other passengers the bus came and did not stop despite there being room on the bus , we all then decided to walk back one stop and get on there which was fine this bus driver then_proceeded to the next stop where we were in the first place and lo and behold he stopped there which added to our anger .
neutral	i was sent the wrong shower from the one pictured .
neutral	when i asked to return it they were excellent , they apologised and were most helpful .
neutral	they sent out a 0nd_class returns sticker .
neutral	on taking it to the post_office i was told this wouldn_'_t cover the postage and had to pay £_00 .
neutral	when i emailed the showershop they said the would look into it as it was usually accepatble .
neutral	i have not heard from them since and am now £_00 for recitfying a mistake they made in the first place .
neutral	i kept getting different automated emails , which said that they had not received my telephone , that the offer would be withdrawn , and with a lower offer price because they said my phone had not arrived on time .
neutral	this was quite worrying and concerning , because i did send off my phone as soon as the package arrived - and in the end , it was acknowledged , and i got the original offer price .
neutral	use of the website and order process was fine , quality of the goods i ordered was fine .
neutral	just the delivery let the whole_experience down .
neutral	driver was quite rude and abrupt !
neutral	the flowers sent to the woolfsons were lovely but the flowers sent to the goodmans were most disappointing !
neutral	!
neutral	only bought as had a discount_voucher , which_meant i got my lenses for £_00 . 00 .
neutral	however , without the voucher they would cost £_00 . 00 plus a possible postage charge of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i usually buy them from my local specsavers for £_00 so i '_ll be staying with them .
neutral	good range of dresses and quick delivery - returns was no problem but would like more security around refunding my account - should be a better way of doing feels dodgy
neutral	have returned items :-
neutral	beige fitflops were different_shades and packed in polythene_bag - obviously not a pair !
neutral	!
neutral	fleur mineral red not as picture .
neutral	mens blue canvas shoes not very good
neutral	i '_m a little disappointed .
neutral	i sent flowers to my mother - in - law on thursday ( 00 ).
neutral	she received on time and was happy .
neutral	yesterday , as usual , i went to lunch at her house and i was totally unhappy with the flowers she had received .
neutral	the roses were totally wiped out and the others flowers were ugly , looked very old .
neutral	when i showed my disappointment she told me to forget .
neutral	i do not think it '_s one thing to forget .
neutral	upon ordering the communication i have found has_been poor i have a pet whom has ibs and only half of his food was dispatched without notifying_me where the rest of the order was which i found was strange ??
neutral	only upon querying the contents was i told the item was out of stock i don_'_t have the good fortune that i can feed my pets anything therefore i was disappointed as half of his food wasn_'_t in stock im now left with 00 tins of food he cannot eat as we had to change his food yet again !!
neutral	!
neutral	hi workwear sales .
neutral	. after_placing an order and paying for it in full .
neutral	the delivery was two_weeks_later than the delivery date we were informed of .
neutral	the hi vis body warmers were a mish - mash of different brands .
neutral	( the sizes were different depending_on the brand ).
neutral	ie_: medium in one brand could be small in another . i orderd fleece_lined and a number of them were actually quilted lining .
neutral	the customer service at the time of ordering were very helpful with the it .
neutral	other than this the body warmers are all good so far .
neutral	excellent quality worktop was delivered quickly .
neutral	but don_'_t expect the delivery drivers to be helpful .
neutral	as i live on the first floor the delivery drivers refused to help get the worktop inside the door and left the worktop half inside and half out side the door .
neutral	this left me in the awkward position of not being_able to close the door until i had rounded up enough troops to move the worktop inside the front_door .
neutral	the quality of the worktop was excellent but the surly , unhelpful , jobswoths that deliver the items made the over all experience poor
neutral	the habitat sample_tile i ordered was fine but the customer service needs to be improved because the instruction board didn_'_t say how to order it ( only about home delivery ) and when i asked a member of staff whether i needed to order it online , he said yes .
neutral	but i couldn_'_t find sample_tiles onlines so i had to return to the shop to order it in store .
neutral	lots of games , slow pay out times .
neutral	frustrating if you are tempted to withdraw .
neutral	good price and they stocked the part i needed but felt the delivery was slow .
neutral	ordered friday_evening , paid for first_class delivery but didn_'_t receive the part until the following wednesday due to it not being shipped until late on tuesday .
neutral	( by contrast , two other orders placed with online_retailers over the same weekend were delivered on monday and tuesday ).
neutral	having said that , i was kept up to date on the progress of the order by email so otherwise the service was good .
neutral	not a good experience as ordered and then was told could not get the bonus offer of free vouchers !
neutral	talk_talk could not rectify had to cancel and re - order , so lots of messing_about , not a good start .
neutral	hopefully i will not regret the decision and they willkeep to their_word this time .
neutral	just delayed the process and now wait a bit longer .
neutral	not good customer service for new customers though
neutral	bought extending ratchet lopper , worked well at cutting small branches but lock to hold extending handles didnt work - kept slipping , vedry annoying
neutral	this is a good car but the staff late at night were not helpful really , hired a smart car with in car sat_nav , this was not pointed_out to us , ( never had this in my own car ).
neutral	so initial journey made with basic map from alternate car_hire company , simple information re how car worked would be very helpful as there was no car manual !
neutral	i was pleased enough with the efficiency of delivery and the amount of flowers in the bouquets but quite disappointed with how both bouquets were arranged .
neutral	the choice of flowers both in variety and colour did not make pleasing displays .
neutral	always on time and delviery people always very fiendly and helpful .
neutral	only_downside is that tesco is often frustratingly out of things i want to buy - sometimes very ordinary things !
neutral	all good but expected delivery to be quicker .
neutral	this was my first time using serenata and they let_me down on my daughters_birthday the flowers are lovely but would not recomrned getting extras her birhtday balloon didnt turn_up they have refunded me straight_away but thats not the point
neutral	the serenata bouquet was lovely , and my mother delighted - when she eventually got it .
neutral	since the delivery bit offers the option ' be patient ' i was shocked to discover that she only found the flowers late in the afternoon when a neighbour spotted them and knocked on the door to alert her to their delivery .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	initially , the online order firm didnt work .
neutral	we had to call up the next_day and try another couple of times .
neutral	they did not want to help with us emailing the copy if the form , it ciuld only be dine by thr ( frustrating ) website ....
neutral	we ordered an incorrect door , and also had received one incorrectly without_any hinge_holes ( not our fault ) but the staff had no concern about urgency of the order and kept referring back to their supplier , who seems to dictate .
neutral	the two doors were due to arrive on two_separate days , and i was simply told to check online for delivery information when i asked that they arrive the same day ( as i took time off work to wait in all day ).
neutral	so not helpful .
neutral	both doors then arrived a day earlier on each_occasion than the scheduled delivery date !
neutral	doors are good - white windsor style , a couple of knocks on the corners which don_'_t show .
neutral	i didn_'_t want the hassle of returning them .
neutral	and the faulty first door without the hinge_holes has never been collected ....
neutral	but i am pleased with the way they look , which is the main_thing in the end !
neutral	i ordered some chairs on a saturday_evening and was delighted to know they would arrive two working_days_later .
neutral	however upon_opening the boxes , i found no assembly_instructions and although it may have seemed obvious the construction of the legs didn_'_t easily fit the base of the chairs so the chairs and screws had to be manipulated considerably for them to fit .
neutral	i hope this hasn_'_t compromised their strength .
neutral	electric_fire was delivered very quickly and returned in about 0_days ( due to week - end ) but it was three_weeks and an_email before my money was refunded .
neutral	surely an undue_delay ?
neutral	my on line buying experience was spoilt by the delivery service .
neutral	we bought a shower_screen for my daughter who_lives on her own in a flat on the first floor .
neutral	the delivery service would not deliver to her flat and would not take away the wood pallet .
neutral	very disappointed and may stop me buying again .
neutral	i cant_fault the fast service but they had given the delivery people an incorrect_address so poor driver spent 0o minutes trying to find us .
neutral	i ordered the gorgeous blue orchid bunch , only i got a text around 0am saying that theyd been loaded_onto the van and were on route . i waited around all day and didn_'_t receive them until after 0pm ... but hey what do you expect for free delivery . when they arrived they they were not only a disappointingly small bunch compared to the picture of them on the internet but many of the delicate leaves were scorched and shrivelled from the heat in the van .
neutral	disappointing
neutral	good delivery speed but quite a lot of the glasses we stuck together or broken
neutral	easy transaction
neutral	ich hatte mir einen schoenen blumentrauss ausgesucht und musste dann feststellen das der gelieferte blumenstrauss ganz anders aussah .
neutral	meine_mutter hatte sich trotzdem gefreut aber ich frag mich warum wir die wahl zwischen vielen verschieden blumenstraeussen bekommen wenn die dann nicht so aussehen wie bestellt .
neutral	ich_kann ja verstehen wenn es verschiedene blumensorten sind solange die farbe stimmt , ich hatte einen strauss mit weissen und rosa farbenden blumen bestellt und geliefert wurde ein blumenstrauss mit roten und orangenen blumen !
neutral	having to enter the code off the post_office reciept into the web account before the refund would be actioned was not good .
neutral	it meant that there was a long delay before i got my refund , as i had not noticed that i needed to do this .
neutral	i dont_know any other company who make you do this .
neutral	they had clearly recieved the boots back , but didnt give me my money as i had not entered the code .
neutral	the food was fabulous .
neutral	it came on time , and customer service was helpful when i had a query about its contents .
neutral	unfortunately despite cancelling my account , i have since been charged_twice .
neutral	for some reason gousto re - activated my account without my permission .
neutral	there is not an option to remove my card_details from their website to prevent this from happening .
neutral	arrived quickly .
neutral	that was excellent .
neutral	easy to assemble .
neutral	at first it was like a dream when whiz zing through the pound coins but unfortunately found it wasn_'_t brilliant on the smaller value coins and after manual checks found it was missing one or two 0ps or 0ps .
neutral	little frustrating for the price of the machine but it is still a time saver in its own way
neutral	some good deals to be had but also some very disappointing ones .
neutral	i was particularly upset when i ordered some jewellery for christmas_presents which turned_out to be terrible - quite embarrassing for me .
neutral	spoilt the whole wowcher experience for me ..... as the saying goes once bitten .........
neutral	i received one part of the order . still_waiting for the last item to arrive .
neutral	service could not be_faulted however the flowers were not what was in the picture .
neutral	only 0 purple ones and alot of greenery .
neutral	the roses were of good quality but it was not of the size of the bunch of flowers in the picture .
neutral	correspondence was great re delivery but i was expecting the new beds to be unwrapped and put_together as per online info .
neutral	i also paid what i thought was for an bed to be taken_away but it was 0 item which with a divan the mattress and base count as two items .
neutral	i had to dispose of the base and packaging myself .
neutral	i am however pleased with the beds and would buy again from mattress man .
neutral	we oredered a years supply of fybogel lemon an were disappointed that it didn_'_t taste like the highstreet pharmacy lemon , but more like lemon / clementines , which isn_'_t the greatest of tastes .
neutral	the order was quite quick , which is a plus for you , but we are disappointed in the taste , which we have to live with for a whole year !
neutral	!
neutral	was told 0 - 0 working_days but had to phone on the fifth to be told it was out of stock but had just come in so would deliver the nest day from supplier ?!
neutral	!
neutral	i placed an order with wood0u on a tuesday , and was kept up to date with news of my items being dispatched .
neutral	i received a text_message on the day of expected delivery , but was disappointed when my goods didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	as it was a saturday , there was no - one around in the wood 0u office to answer my calls ( or at the freight service ) and so i had waited in all day for nothing ( and i paid £_00 for saturday delivery ).
neutral	however , i called wood0u on monday_morning and they explained to me that the freight service had ran_out of time on saturday , and so even_though i rescheduled for the following saturday , my goods turned_up that afternoon .
neutral	worryingly all my goods were left in my back garden and no - one text me to say they had been delivered .
neutral	but thankfully it didn_'_t rain that day so i was able to take them inside .
neutral	i haven_'_t heard whether i will be refunded for the £_00 saturday delivery charge , yet .
neutral	overall , the sales service was excellent but the delivery was a bit shabby .
neutral	the nationwide account_manager i dealt_with was aware that i needed a vehicle as quickly as possible .
neutral	a delay in chasing the car of my choice meant that i ended_up having to pay more than originally_quoted as the car was no_longer available .
neutral	my email with proof of identity sat in his inbox for a week before i chased for a response so that the paperwork could be issued to me - this then seemed to take a while - and then an_error in signing the paperwork ( on my part ) meant that i had another 0 day wait before the " cooling_off period " could start .
neutral	just all felt a bit drawn_out .
neutral	i didn_'_t think that the places to sign on the paperwork were highlighted very clearly - my accountant actually highlights the area to sign - much_better , as an idea .
neutral	the guy_who dropped my car off to me was brilliant !
neutral	i '_ve no notifications at all and i haven_'_t received my item so what else can i say
neutral	purchased a hoodie online as a special present .
neutral	after five_minutes on , the neck cord caught on velcro and snagged and pulled , leaving it looking rubbish .
neutral	contacted customer_care who said they couldn_'_t source any new cord , sorry for the inconvenience .
neutral	inconvenience ?!
neutral	wrong choice of word , more like extreme disappointment .
neutral	thus began a lengthy and frustrating correspondence resulting in me being sent a different colour cord from a returned faulty item .
neutral	the garment is nice and of good quality , the pull_cord cheap quality .
neutral	nice as it is , i '_m not sure i '_d rush back .
neutral	someone somewhere is cutting lengths of cord off a roll to feed through the eyelets .
neutral	can '_t help wondering how hard it can be to cut me a bit ...
neutral	i though the software was good and quite straight_forward to use , but when i received the book i was a bit dissapointed with a few of the larger pictures and they were blurred and almost out of focus ( it must be where you make them larger the quality is worst ) i could not see this on my copy on screen as i would not have processed the order if i could see that the larger pictures were like this as it has spoilt the overall book .
neutral	i was pleased with the delivery and it made a lovely present for my brother and sister in law for their wedding day but very disspoainted with the larger pictures , this should have been flagged before ordering or processing .
neutral	glasses were made incorrectly , which was inconvenient .
neutral	it wasn_'_t till i went to another optician regarding headaches that i discovered why .
neutral	the replacement was dealt_with quickly and professionally , however one would expect to be re -_imbursed to some extent for the inconvenience .
neutral	overall the glasses were good in the end and the opticians are pleasant to deal with .
neutral	in the long run i would say it '_s easier to get a pair done on the high_street though .
neutral	i gave 0_stars because they show that they care about customers satisfaction .
neutral	and that '_s all .
neutral	it '_s just that they were not as in the picture .
neutral	i don_'_t care that they gave_me a vaucher .
neutral	i think i won_'_t try second time .
neutral	yes , what was nice that i got second bunch as compensations for free .
neutral	the product is good quality and great value for money .
neutral	however , the delivery company that hello_canvas use was awlful !
neutral	no effort at all to try and deliver and just because i live in a road of flats they choose not to deliver to my flat !
neutral	they had my number and no effort to try and call if they could not find it !
neutral	i had to phone the company and track down my delivery driver .
neutral	i met the delivery driver and everything in the back of the van had just been thrown in and there was a big hole in my parcel , luckily it wad not damaged !
neutral	the only_thing that would stop me using this website again was the delivery company !
neutral	good website and clear_instructions but .... big problems at your garage on marsh lane in preston where i went to enquire_about a replacement tyre today .
neutral	i wanted a budget tyre replacement and the employee automatically tried to sell me a tyre for £_000 - i came home and researched on your website that i could get the tyre i wanted for £_00 .
neutral	it seems to me your employees are taking_advantage of female drivers - just listen to me and offer me your best deal and don_'_t treat me like a child .
neutral	see above , annoying when you have to find more screws of the right colour and size to match .
neutral	like other customers i too have had a mixed experience with very .
neutral	my very first order an laptop was ' accidentally ' sent to the carriers distribution_centre in llandudno ... not bad as i live in lincolnshire the complete_opposite_side of the country !
neutral	i complained after 0_days which was the delivery time given on ordering and was told that it may take up to 00 days , i told them ' look on the parcel tracking_system and you will see it is stuck in llandudno ' ( which is where it still is !)
neutral	after 00 e_-_mails and two official complaints i eventually suggested that they cancel the original order and reorder for me ( why didnt they think of this ?)
neutral	however the parcel turned_up within 0_days and according to the tracking_system the original parcel is still in llandudno .
neutral	before retiring i worked in customer_care and the very team need to start thinking_about the customer and not their workload !
neutral	purchased a cool shirt for the husband by two stoned .
neutral	it was on sale but still came to £_00 .
neutral	two problems with the shirt , although he does look cool in it .
neutral	as he tried it on the first time , a button came off in his hand .
neutral	as i was sewing it on , i found none of the buttons were properly knotted and all were destined to come off with a tug .
neutral	invested a fair_amount of time in " repairing " a newly purchased piece of clothing and am quite disappointed .
neutral	the second thing is a problem with the site .
neutral	no care instructions are provided .
neutral	the shirt isn_'_t pre_- washed or pre_- shrunk , so no tumble drying or it will shrink , " do not dry in sunlight " or it will fade , etc .
neutral	quite a high - maintenance item .
neutral	if you want a long - term project , i would recommend bonsai or a nice jigsaw_puzzle over trying to maintain your two - stoned clothing .
neutral	got these half price so maybe inferior quality flowers used !
neutral	this is the second time i have used this company , and the text_message communication is excellent , texting both before and after delivery .
neutral	however , the experience was tainted by the fact that the flowers were dead .
neutral	a replacement bouquet of my choice was sent the following_day , but it obviously ruined the surprise , so i would not_necessarily use this company again .
neutral	have previously been extremely pleased with all_aspects of the flower
neutral	ordering , and have recommended the company to friends on several
neutral	occasions ; but this time had great difficulty in processing the
neutral	order - to the extent that i missed the cut - off point for delivery date , very , very disappointing .
neutral	it was good to receive a phone_call from a very
neutral	helpful member of staff , after which things moved very swiftly .
neutral	thank_you for that .
neutral	i had trouble with running my photo programmes to get the images i wanted and i '_m_sure i ordered the book in landscape but received a portrait book .
neutral	comparing it to other books i '_ve had done it holds its own and is of better quality than some .
neutral	however i have two cewe_books that have the wow_factor and the price was also similar .
neutral	the pages in the book would look better in gloss to bring the prints to life .
neutral	if there was a facility to do this with your programme it wasn_'_t allowing me to find it .
neutral	it would allow me to put prints onto a page then shuffle them around into spaces that were not appropriate for the images used e . g it would put a landscape into a square place .
neutral	this got annoying when i was happy with how i had arranged the images and it shuffled them around again .
neutral	i did have more prints i wanted in the book but hadn_'_t the patience to do anymore .
neutral	to see if it was my computer i did run another book from another company and this problem did not occur .
neutral	the efficiency of your company with the actual order when it was placed was very good .
neutral	the messages received to know when the book was completed and despatched was as good as any other company i '_ve_used and better_than most .
neutral	the time it took to process and deliver was also extremely good probably the quickest service so far .
neutral	thankyou
neutral	i was pleased with the rug and service , but i was disappointed that the rug has a slight imperfection , an irregular line in the pile .
neutral	unfortunately with a rug and the cost of returning it , i won_'_t return it .
neutral	a little_disappointing and it would put me off ordering again .
neutral	hello
neutral	it is the first time i buy from serenata .
neutral	the delivery was very good .
neutral	i was informed when it was on its way and when it was delivered .
neutral	the packaging and presentation of the double orchids was impressive ( in a special two - double pot ).
neutral	however , i was disappointed as the flowers on the orchids themselves were basically almost towards the end of their life .
neutral	i am expecting them to fall_off any time now ( i got them on thursday_evening ).
neutral	my only worry is that even the buds don_'_t blossom and just fall_off .
neutral	i have watered them as soon as they have arrived but just not sure about their condition .
neutral	the service provided was quick and the colours of the flowers where nice .
neutral	my mother liked them but when i saw the bouquet i was disappointed as it was much smaller_than that advertised .
neutral	had i known that this small sized bunch was to be delivered i would have used interflora .
neutral	not impressed with what was sent and i felt rather embarrassed at what had actually beeen sent from me to my mother .
neutral	had quite bad_experience with deliveries and customer service at wowcher
neutral	despite problems with suppliers saw them listed again
neutral	groupon far_superior
neutral	i feel that they need to do more in x large for women because i love superdry i thinks great value but being on the slightly_bigger side not a lot fits me
neutral	the slide arm on the bottom drawer of my lg american_style fridge_freezer came away due to the fixing screw breaking .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find anywhere that could replace the screw so bought the full slide arm from partmaster for £_00 . 00 plus £ 0 . 00p &_p .
neutral	it was delivered very quickly but without a fixing screw .
neutral	partmaster advised me they don_'_t supply them with the slide arm and said i could get one from any diy_store .
neutral	tried every diy_store possible and couldn_'_t find one .
neutral	partmaster was happy to refund but i would have the return postage deducted , making it the second £ 0 . 00 i had to pay out .
neutral	i would have been out of pocket by £_00 . 00 and still no near to sorting_out my original problem .
neutral	kept the part in the end but its useless without correct fixing .
neutral	not impressed with lg .
neutral	i made my order late thursday_night , had ordered enough to get the " free next_day delivery " and of course i thought it was too late for the order to arrive on friday .
neutral	but i actually didn_'_t get my order until tuesday !
neutral	how on earth is that next_day delivery ??
neutral	?
neutral	otherwise satisfied with the products and services , the website is good , but could use a slightly easier search_function , took me a while to find what i was looking for .
neutral	can '_t remember if each product showed the ingredients and nutritional_information , but otherwise that is a must when ordering online .
neutral	i would never put a product into my shopping_basket in a shop without checking that out and if a person chooses to go online to buy speciality health products , they firstly are already very health conscious people who_wants to checking out the ingredients and nutritional_information and secondly they would like to know if what they are buying is really what they expect it to be .
neutral	pre orded ps0 console in plenty of time to get on release day as surprise gift for husband .
neutral	then was going to leave it up to him to buy games as i cannot_afford them as well .
neutral	then a few_weeks before launch ( when to late to pre order from anywhere_else ) was then advised that to be able to get order i would havd to change to a package including an extra controller which he would never use for extra £_00 .
neutral	ish or game and controller for extra £_000 . 00 ish .
neutral	so i had to ruin the surprise to be able to borrow money off husband and know what game to get .
neutral	felt bullied_into buyinv more than i wanted .
neutral	i found the website really easy to use except the currency rate was all in euro meaning it was difficult to determine what the price was in sterling so possibly listing prices in a few currencies would be better .
neutral	the directions to park and fly dublin were completely wrong !
neutral	the directions on the actual " park and fly dublin " website were even worse !
neutral	i decided to order an extra large bunch but when my sister saw it she described it as ' small '.
neutral	bit disappointed !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a knife_block for 00 knives , and received it very quickly and i am delighted with the block , all my knives on one place , and a tidier kitchen .
neutral	but somehow i apparently ordered three more blocks , and my bank was credited for over_£_000 .
neutral	i honestly can say that i did not order the three , what on earth would i do with them ???
neutral	but , i am a pensioner and the thought of losing over a £_000 was just too much , and i contacted procook who agreed to refund my money , i waited and waited , i didn_'_t get the three blocks either , and after over a week i rang them again and it was resolved_immediately .
neutral	today the money is back in my account , i am happy with the result even if it took a while , and best of all i have a really smart and useful knife_block .
neutral	thank_you for all your help .
neutral	when the confirmation_email is sent saying goods have been despatched there seems to be a delay in them getting to the carrier , sometimes it takes two_days before the carrier shows any tracking .
neutral	efficient carrier usually same driver delivers at around the same time of day .
neutral	pleasant helpful driver .
neutral	however , locked me out when i got to the payment page and when i went back in price had gone up by 00 %.
neutral	would have been nice to let_me complete at the old price as i was already in the door so to speak .
neutral	i really do like using amazon as it is cheap , has quick deliveries to the north_east of scotland ( and doesn_'_t charge you extra for it ) and the products are of a very good quality .... but ... what is not helpful is the use of the market place in amongst all the amazon things .
neutral	i could place an order for 0 different items and not know until the check out that it could be 0 different companies who all want to charge me postage and have different delivery times up to 00 days .
neutral	that is not helpful and has caught we out a few_times .
neutral	it might be more helpful to keep the market place in a different tab on the same page so that you are aware that you are straying onto another site .
neutral	aaa stated in summary above
neutral	vistaprint is a useful site for me as a budding avon rep whose hands cramp something chronic after writing out my information 000 times on the order forms .
neutral	i have been able to pick_up a rubber stamp at a reasonable_price , and was lucky_enough to catch the free_postage offer this time around .
neutral	i do rather object to the almost constant_emails i have been receiving , however .
neutral	vistaprint , i will buy what i want when i want and need it , i do not need to be showered with emails about " special_offers just for you !!!
neutral	", which nine times out of ten are entirely irrelevant to me .
neutral	i will keep shopping there , because the products i have received * have * been of good quality ( and i really do need the stamps !).
neutral	i will be attempting business_cards next .
neutral	all - in - all , if you can handle getting a plethora of emails a couple of times a week , vistaprint are a good place to pick things up from .
neutral	having bought calendars and photo - books in the past , i was rather disappointed in the quality of this book .
neutral	the paper seemed too thin .
neutral	i would rather pay a little more and have a more substantial product .
neutral	in future i would want to know the weight of the paper to be used for each potential item .
neutral	it took me quite a long time to sort this book only to be rather underwhelmed by the finished_product .
neutral	quality doesnt look as good as previous blinds i have brought from you and had a nightmare with the courier you used !!
neutral	would consider a different company when buying again !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a case of egg_whites as i had run_out and deliberately ordered from this site , even_though slightly more_expensive , as they could offer next_day delivery .
neutral	low and behold the next_day came and went and i didn_'_t got get a delivery , nor a phone_call .
neutral	i got an_email after customer_services had shut saying the driver " couldn_'_t find my office door ", which is quite_frankly bizarre as everybody else can !
neutral	i mean what '_s the point in putting a phone number down on an order if they ' re not going to try to call you to find you .
neutral	he could only have been sat outside !
neutral	anyway , so i didn_'_t get it delivered until after the weekend , by which i had to go out and buy some more egg_whites at waitrose , and borrow some of someone_else and my own_expense .
neutral	all i got was a little apology and no offer of compensation at all .
neutral	i would probably try someone_else first now instead of ordering from here again .
neutral	i used interparcel for the first time , as i had read online that most people were happy with them .
neutral	i paid_extra for a service which was supposed to collect the same day and deliver the next_day .
neutral	however , i waited in all day , and my parcel wasn_'_t collected .
neutral	i had to contact both interparcel and the courier concerned , and eventually managed to arrange the collection for the following_day .
neutral	it was collected the following_day , but i had paid_extra for a service i could have got cheaper if i had originally selected a 0 - day delivery .
neutral	even_though i informed interparcel of this , they did nothing to compensate me for the extra money i had paid or for me wasting 0_days waiting in for the parcel collection .
neutral	service is average and i don_'_t know if i would trust using them again .
neutral	better living were very prompt in coming out after my initial_contact and the furniture didn_'_t take long to be made .
neutral	steve maybury was the fitter and i am very happy with the end product .
neutral	he did a fantastic job , working very competently with great professionalism and very tidily .
neutral	i was told however by the salesman that the job would take 0 day when in fact it took 0 and this could not be attributed to the fitter .
neutral	i was misled !
neutral	i was also persuaded to take out finance in order to get a higher discount on the furniture , provided it was paid off over a short_period of time ( 0months ).
neutral	against my better judgement i agreed and this has given me a great headache .
neutral	the figures given by the salesman and later by the surveyor did not match up and i strongly feel that the paperwork should be simplified in order that the customer can understand .
neutral	it more easily .
neutral	i had to pay the fitter independently and the wrong amount was transferred_into my bank_account , this error had to be corrected
neutral	i have today paid off the whole amount to the finance company .
neutral	would i use better living again or recommend them probably not !
neutral	!
neutral	the two costumes i ordered arrived quickly .. the childs santa costume i ordered was minus the santa beard !!!
neutral	obviously failed to be packed in the bag .... so one disappointed boy .. as the costumes were needed three_days_later i decided not to return the costume as i managed to pick_up a beard at a cheap shop .. will i buy from here again ... no .. i also think the costumes are of poor quality for the price you pay
neutral	needed to contact you about delivery and left several messages but could only get automated_response .
neutral	disapointed that i could not speak to anyone to solve a major problem .
neutral	i have used glasses_direct before and am always over the moon with the glasses i receive .
neutral	last time i ordered from them last_year there was an issue regarding the ' free tint ' offere they were running at the time .
neutral	rinning customer_services proved useless but my issue was dealt_with once i emailed .
neutral	i have recently had my eyes retested and found that my prescription had altered slightly so looked again at glasses_direct , all the frames i liked seemed pricey so i decided to try a few frames on a home_trial basis and wait for a groupon_voucher to come up .
neutral	luckily i didn_'_t have to wait long and the same day my voucher came through i received an_email from glasses_direct saying they had a 00_%_off frames offer .
neutral	brilliant i thought , suddenly the frames i thought were out of my price range were affordable so i promptly ordered another home_trial to check the frames i wanted and placed an order .
neutral	unfortunately , like last time , the promotion was misleading and not available in conjunction with my groupon_voucher .
neutral	this put me in a difficult position as i had already paid for the groupon_voucher and so felt that rather_than waste the money on that i had to make the purchase .
neutral	i could have chosen less expensive frames but didn_'_t want to be stuck with frames i didn_'_t like .
neutral	i am now looking_forward to receiving my new frames , am just disappointed that once again i '_ve felt let_down by the incentives to purchase .
neutral	i feel the website needs updating , to make it faster ( fewer clicks ) to order a repeat_prescription , once ordered the email_confirmation you receive doesn_'_t contain any details apart_from an order number .
neutral	i would expect to see the repeat_prescription item name and cost etc in there , but its blank and always says £ 0 ?
neutral	i have reported this to the telephone team but no action has_been taken .
neutral	once ordered the turn_around time for delivery of a repeat_prescription is very good .
neutral	i have recently_purchased rosehip_tablets and was very disappointed to only receive one bottle whereas i have always had the bogof_offer .
neutral	was this due to ordering on the internet and not from my catalogue ?
neutral	i did get a 00_% reduction but this cannot compare to getting them half price in effect .
neutral	yours baffled
neutral	still_waiting for dvd to arrive , 0_days now .
neutral	my partner ordered one on the same day and only took 0_days to arrive , pretty certain this will be a one time buy from this site ...
neutral	order placed on a tuesday , received a phone_call after about 0 hours to arrange delivery and was given the option of thursday or friday .
neutral	arranged for thursday , no time given .
neutral	on thursday waited_until 00am then called to see if they could let_me know a time .
neutral	was told " by 0pm " and given the number for the delivery company .
neutral	called the delivery company at 0 . 00pm and was told " by 0 or 0pm " delivery actually turned_up at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	taps are poor quality with no thread in some parts so time will tell if they leak .
neutral	the sink has a ' dip ' ( not a damage dent ) on one side on the top .
neutral	the bath_panel is very flimsy and doesn_'_t fit solid to the bath due to the plastic_clips supplied .
neutral	the toilet is fine !
neutral	we are happy now the bathroom is fitted but expect there to be leaks with the poor quality taps and time will tell if the panel ends up having to be replaced .
neutral	not yet received order
neutral	the booking process was fine until i encountered an_error_message_stating my card_details were entered incorrectly .
neutral	that couldn_'_t have been possible as i had selected paypal .
neutral	i figured_out it was because i had typed the airline name next to the flight number , but it took trial and error to figure_out what field it had a problem with .
neutral	when i contacted customer_services they called me by the wrong name and didn_'_t seem too fussed about the problem .
neutral	still , i got a good price and despite the above problems the service was good .
neutral	i got no promised tracking_information on the delivery date , so contacted santana for advice .
neutral	i subsequently got an_email_confirming delivery .
neutral	i have not yet heard from the recipient , s , but don_'_t doubt that the ordered flowers would delight them .
neutral	the bunch of flowers ordered ( already good value ), were reduced , so , represented even better value for money .
neutral	i thoroughly_recommend the company .
neutral	i was pleased with the key ring i ordered with a photo of a light_coloured dog .
neutral	but the cube was a different_story !!
neutral	i could hardly see the image even when held up to bright_sunlight .
neutral	it was of a black puppy .
neutral	it didn_'_t stipulate that the photo had to be bright .
neutral	i did return the cube and received a cheque but no offer of re - doing with a different photo .
neutral	hey_ho iwill have to go without .
neutral	we had e_- mailed to let you know or colour option for the flowers we had ordered for our mums funeral as there was not an option to allow us to choose on the order page .
neutral	we had no response to this so i rang giving my colour choice .
neutral	on the day of the funeral we found that our colour choice had not been honoured on the basket of roses and the thinking of you flowers .
neutral	this did not upset our day but if these colours were not available it would have been nice to know before hand .
neutral	the cross however was beautiful .
neutral	my order took several weeks to arrive but credit_card debited_immediately - shame
neutral	thankfully i havent had to contact talk - talk many_times for my mam '_s broadband ( she rarely has any_problems ).
neutral	unfortunately when i did contact them , they were totally_useless - obviously reading from a script .
neutral	if talk - talk brought their customer_services back to the uk - i would consider switching my home broadband .
neutral	nothing against our offshore friends - they just dont understand me and it isnt fair on me or them .
neutral	i do use this as its auto on my browser bar , but i prefer yahoos .
neutral	loved using this site to create calanders invites xmas cards an things on over xmas its just a shame the p_&_p is so expensive .
neutral	the payment system argos are using is sometimes failing but still charging your card so u end up having to ring .
neutral	ebays site is brill , easy to use and well_protected , but they should cap the p_&_p_charges in all categories not just some , someone wanted £_00 delivery for a hardrive u can put in a jiffy_bag an post for less_than £ 0 .
neutral	not good !
neutral	but dont buy your grocerys from the fresh as your always given short dates and u cant rummage to the back of the breads for the one with the longest date on it .
neutral	as a brand that positions itself as upmarket , i was very disappointed with the service .
neutral	i ordered on a tuesday_morning by the following wednesday , i had neither received a dispatch_notification or the good themselves .
neutral	i called and they checked on the status of my order .
neutral	they told me the goods were out for dispatch and apologized that i '_d not received the notification which then landed in my inbox immediately .
neutral	i received the goods the following_day .
neutral	unfortunately the fit of the jeans was not right and i '_ve sent them back .
neutral	it '_ll be interesting to see how long the refund process takes !
neutral	i guess i am too used to shopping with the likes of john_lewis , topshop and asos etc where the order process is swift and efficient .
neutral	clearly seraphine is not to the same beast and perhaps it '_s not fair on me to compare .
neutral	however , if they ' re going to push their a - list connections and their royal fan base , then they need to deliver an a - list service - to all their customers .
neutral	my stationary from them was good value for money .
neutral	we were very pleased with the quality , when we eventually recieved them .
neutral	the only_thing that let them down was the fact that , on the website is estimates 0_days delivery .
neutral	after waiting a week and hearing_nothing , i phoned them up to be told that the card needed in my design was out of stock but should be in the following_day .
neutral	i should recieve them on the fri or monday at the very latest .
neutral	monday arrived and still no cards so another phone_call and this time i was told that they would be shipped that night .
neutral	i eventually recieved them 0 and a half weeks after i ordered them .
neutral	it was frustrating that not once in that period did i recieve any contact from them to say there was a problem .
neutral	yet they had my money !
neutral	i was very close to cancelling my order because of this .
neutral	i would reccomend allowing plenty of time for your item to arrive .
neutral	flowers and chocs were excellent but the delivery person left them on the doorstep when my mother was out .
neutral	fortunately they had not been stolen !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered crutches they came but were faulty had to be collected and replaced but replacement could not take place until they had received faulty ones back not my fault but i still had to wait they had got my money but i had nothing they promised me as soon as faulty ones received back then new crutches would be dispatched for next_day in the end i ended_up chasing this company for five days no next_day delivery just lies after lies on the phone i asked to speak to a manager but never got to speak to one finally got crutches seven_days late to what was expected not impressed will not be using this company again they have no compassion at all just a call_centre that lie and blame everyone but the company they work for do no trust this company i will never use them again .
neutral	i '_m afraid i can '_t write a review until i have actually received my order
neutral	i found the ordering process really quick and easy and the goods were delivered incredibly swiftly .
neutral	however , when i called with a relatively simple question about flow and return temperatures , no one was really able to answer my question .
neutral	i eventually had to call the manufacturer of the radiator directly to get a response .
neutral	i thought a prompt service , but the 00 minute window to view the tiles for any breakages given that there is no exact delivery time was a bit_harsh .
neutral	and the extremely rude_unhelpful delivery man was a positive minus .
neutral	the meet and greet service is a really convenient idea and the driver was prompt and polite .
neutral	however , the printed instructions for drop - off at gatwick_north were incorrect
neutral	( and evidently were known to be incorrect when sent ).
neutral	the despatcher on the phone for the last_minute confirmation of arrival did not make it clear that these directions were not to be followed and consequently we did 0 round trips of the carpark ( paying for 0 tickets to exit ) before an airport worker redirected us .
neutral	i tried to email the company about this but received no reply .
neutral	not sure how difficult it would be for them to update their information .
neutral	i have to admit the service was great in the sense my order was here in a few_days and the website had great choice and was fun to use , but it was very disappointing , the quality of the costume i had ordered .
neutral	i feel it had been photographed to look better_than the actual product .
neutral	although this is just one off the disadvantages to shopping online .
neutral	lovely clothing , very well priced , but returns take much longer_than other_companies
neutral	the order process was very straight_forward but there were very few flowers for the money we spent compared to other_florists with mainly greenery .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i would not use them again .
neutral	service was good but product disappointing
neutral	thank_heavens for instant music purchase , but again - why can '_t i see the uk page when i '_m out of the uk ?
neutral	why can '_t i have it in english , search in english etc .
neutral	the internet is meant to be international .
neutral	i have not yet tried all of the items purchased but so far have found the meaty_pork_sausages to be free of gristle - as promised - ' tho quite fatty but a nice flavour .
neutral	the prime haché steaks were ok but nothing spectacular .
neutral	the great british mini beef roasting_joint scares me as it is completely lean but has a thick band of gristle running through it which will either make it meltingly tender or as tough as an old boot .
neutral	the steaks all look pretty similar ( with the exception of the fillets ) & it will be interesting to see how they eat as they are fairly thinly cut , which is a pity .
neutral	not sure yet whether or not this was a wise purchase !
neutral	i can '_t give you any feedback regarding the 0 orders i recently placed , until i have heard from the recipients of the flowers ordered , that they are as they should be !
neutral	however i recently received a bouquet - amazonia , ordered in australia , which was very impressive but did not contain all the flowers listed in the details or on the video_clip !
neutral	there were no ' birds of paradise ' but plenty of leaves !
neutral	a little_disappointing but i couldn_'_t tell them in australia that it was anything other than ' spectacular ' ( which , sadly , it really wasn_'_t )
neutral	the flowers arrived on time as requested but was alittle
neutral	disappointed with the quality of the flowers vs the cost ....
neutral	i ordered some great flint grey skinny cords which i could not find anywhere in size 00 except for you .
neutral	they were more_expensive than all the other sales by £_00 however i really wanted these ones to go with an outfit .
neutral	they were nicely_packaged and took a week to get here .
neutral	i was not very impressed that the name on my order was changed .
neutral	i had my order delivered to my work place where other staff_members also get their orders delivered to .
neutral	a package arrived for jason ford who assumed it was his and started_using the product .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until i asked if any bio tone had been delivered and we checked the order number that we realised it was my order .
neutral	i put all my details on the order form and did not write anything to do with jason ford .
neutral	i was not best pleased with this service .
neutral	we booked through looking0parking and paid .
neutral	we printed out the confirmation as requested , but there were no dorections on it .
neutral	by the day before our flight we had received no_indication of where the parking was situated - we were not sure_whether this should have come from looking0parking or the carpark itself .
neutral	we looked it up on the web and it took_ages to find rather sketchy directions .
neutral	on the morning of the flight we followed these but could not find the carpark , and had to park elsewhere as we were running out of time .
neutral	on our return we found that we had to fork_out another £_000 for the week '_s parking .
neutral	we are seasoned travelleres but found this system unclear and there didn_'_t seem to be anywhere to ask for a refund .
neutral	but what i am no satisfied is a i sent a email to chemist help_desk services on my order and till now none had replied my mail , in my opinion no trustful services .
neutral	went to the peel centre toysrus after reserving toys online which i found helpful , however when i went to the customer service desk to pick_up the goods the staff were as miserable as sin !!
neutral	no smile or a thank_you .
neutral	if i buy goods from a shop i expect the staff to be friendly and to at_least say thank_you instead all i got was a grunt !
neutral	the assistant who_served me acted like i was putting her out .
neutral	not good !
neutral	delivery to my address in mainland_scotland is supposed to be approx .
neutral	£_00 !
neutral	!
neutral	flowers delivered on time however i was slightly_disappointed with the arrangement and quantity considering i upgraded to have more flowers .
neutral	i purchased the pods as part of a deal from groupon .
neutral	nespresso_pods are expensive and we go through a lot in a month as both my husband and i are big coffee drinkers .
neutral	the taste is great , however to get the flavour i get from the nespresso_pods ( even using the strongest ) requires 0 pods per mug in comparrison to 0 pod with the nespresso so unfortunately this makes is just as expensive as the nespresso .
neutral	i really like the fact that they are individually packaged , however out of 0 boxes i had 0 pods which had burst making them useless .
neutral	the seal of the pods needs to be looked at
neutral	still_waiting for my order , after returning the wrong back . i would have thought they could have sent the correct order immediately after my phone_call last friday_morning . it is now wednesday !
neutral	i couldn_'_t fault the delivery .
neutral	i was updated and informed on its_whereabouts regularly and it arrived on time .
neutral	unfortunately though the the zip on the costume broke as i was just putting it on for the party .
neutral	i was so disappointed as ( in my opinion ) i '_d spent quite a bit on it .
neutral	so therefore i may think_twice about ordering online .
neutral	i have ordered a premium quality book .
neutral	i was happy with an overall quality but unfortunately outer_packaging arrived damaged which affected corners of the book .
neutral	corners of the front_cover were bent and bottom corners of top pages were damaged too .
neutral	i also felt that some of the pictures looked over - processed .
neutral	apparently i should have switch auto correct off which i did not know of .
neutral	i think you should be switching such a function on , if you wish to have it applied .
neutral	i treat this a a minor mistake and i hope it can be rectified .
neutral	as i previously ordered a book and i was very satisfied .
neutral	after a recommendation from a friend i decided to upload quidco onto my mobile and try out the check - in option ( ie you usually get 0 or 00p if you check into stores ).
neutral	i found it very frustrating for two reasons_: 0 ) you have to wait about 0 minutes between check - ins , although some of the stores are only a few feet away from each other .
neutral	this doesn_'_t seem long , but if you leave it 0 minutes and then try again , the location sensor seems to think you have travelled half a mile_away and it can take up to 00_minutes to get it to recognise your correct location .
neutral	the refresh option is not obvious ( you have to pull the list down from the top ) and in any case seems to make no difference , even if you have changed location .
neutral	that said , it '_s a good way of making a few extra_pennies if you can be bothered to persevere with it .
neutral	having shopped last_week in poole , dorset ... i came to do the price quarantee on line and it would not let_me do so , kept coming up with an_error_message . i asked in store yesterday if this offer was a one off as i had done it the week before and was told no i should be able to enter my details but after 0 attempts i still cannot get on to this site with my details ..
neutral	was satisfied with sales and delivery of item . pleased with item but when we had a queerie , and sent an_email , we got no reply .
neutral	lovely garment .... just what i wanted ... but not true to size .. had to sent for larger than normally worn ... returns were very quick ... thank_you
neutral	having sent my exemption cert twice still struggled to get order delivered
neutral	website not as easy to navigate as asos .
neutral	delivery options should include a free choice .
neutral	i ordered a new tripp_trapp , having already got one plus baby set for my son and assumed i could attach the baby set to the new chair .
neutral	unfortunately stokke updated the baby set in the last couple of years and the new model does not have holes for the safety bar .
neutral	the closeup chair photos on the back in action website do show these holes and it isn_'_t obvious that they aren_'_t required to fit the new babyset , however seeing that the babyset had changed i should have double_checked .
neutral	i called the team who no_longer have any old models .
neutral	luckily my son will ' share ' his chair for a while and we can keep the one we have bought but i may have chosen a different colour knowing this .
neutral	i would suggest that the photos of the chair on the website are updated to help buyers in the same situation .
neutral	i booked and paid in advcance ( online ) for long - stay parking at edinburgh_airport .
neutral	all went_swimmingly until i put my ticket in at the barrier and was informed that i owed £_00 !
neutral	i pushed the button , spoke to the attendant , frantically_searched for my reference_number and then was let out with no_qualms , however , it was a wee_bit stressful !
neutral	not sure if you are still supposed to insert your ticket in a pay station before returning to your car to have it validated or whatever , that wasn_'_t flagged to me at time of booking .
neutral	i used to use edinburgh_airport almost every week for either business or pleasure trips and always found the parking convenient and fairly_priced .
neutral	howver in the last 0 years the prices seem to have increased to an incredible amount
neutral	i used chemist_direct to order some numbing cream , and as i needed it quickly i payed for special delivery .
neutral	i also added some hayfever_tablets to my order .
neutral	i was sent an_email later that day to say i couldnt have the cream as it was licensed for my intended use ( which is fair_enough ) but they had proceeded to send out my hayfever_tablets using the special delivery .
neutral	it would have made more sense to contact me and ask if i still wanted £ 0 . 00 tablets sending at a delivery cost of £ 0 . 00
neutral	edited
neutral	i have edited this as chemist_direct have contacted me and offered to refund my postage without me having to complain .
neutral	found online statements confusing was charged interest even_though i tried to explain statement confusing - will think_twice about shopping with very or recommending
neutral	airparks parking - very stressful - small portacabin to book in 0 members of staff initially - large queue .
neutral	same queue for people not already pre booked which held up everybody - waited 00_mins for transfer_bus in the cold .
neutral	will not use again would prefer nearer the airport .
neutral	return_journey bus was full but luckily last on the bus so first off - no_doubt there would have been another large queue .
neutral	not always acceptable
neutral	previously your instructions were one tablet once a day and the first week two tablets three_times a day whereas now you suggest three tablets to be taken at night .
neutral	i found the tablets more effective with your first instructions last time , now i am waiting to see the effect with your new instructuions .
neutral	yours_sincerely
neutral	jan abel
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of glasses in the same frames ( but different_colours ).
neutral	one pair was for reading , and other pair was for distance .
neutral	unfortunately both_pairs are for reading - somehow instead of giving me two_pairs with the two different_prescriptions , only the one prescription was used .
neutral	would it be possible to send the correct lenses ?
neutral	products were excellent and looked great on the table .
neutral	postage - i was out when parcel tried to be delivered very late_afternoon after waiting in all day for it .
neutral	could have been left with neighbour or at side of house .
neutral	card in door said delivery tomorrow - waited all day until 00 . 00 spoke to ipost who said it was out for delivery - not here by 00 . 00 do called ipost again who said driver had an_emergency and had to go home but then they changed story and said he was on way back to depot .
neutral	couldn_'_t guarantee delivery ad a morning slot the following_day so i had to go and collect it from the depot 00 miles_away .
neutral	postage 0 . 00 petrol 0 . 00 phone_calls - a very expensive parcel x
neutral	there was no opportunity to pick a delivery date at the time of making the order so i had to arrange this with fedex after one failed delivery attempt .
neutral	it would be easier for all concerned if customers could pick a date as part of the ordering process as on other_websites .
neutral	two items were broken when they arrived .
neutral	one ( large box with folding lid ) was so badly broken it can '_t be used , and the damage obviously occurred as a result of a heavier item being dumped in the box on top of it .
neutral	the other item ( chest of drawers ), the damage is superficial rather_than structural and i can glue the broken bits back on .
neutral	i phoned to let the store know about this when the goods arrived on friday_afternoon but the office was shut - i think it shuts at 0pm .
neutral	the suspension file boxes , on the other hand , look sturdy and good quality .
neutral	useful site but the result cane through with the letter ssi and gsi on the list .... what do these mean ?
neutral	i think they are something to do with the quotes but i '_d be guessing ...
neutral	although my parcel arrived in good time , it had burst_open .
neutral	luckily all items were still inside and nothing had been damaged .
neutral	the flowers that i received were beautiful and they kept me in the loop with regards to delivery .
neutral	however i paid more especially to ensure it was a decent_sized bouquet but in fact it was just a small bunch that could have come from a supermarket for £_00 .
neutral	shame .
neutral	the website , stock and pricing is excellent .
neutral	then it falls down with delivery .
neutral	the courier was going to the wrong_address .
neutral	after i xhased delivery i then receive different delivery dates from different_departments .
neutral	it turns_out the courier was going to the flat downstairs contrary to my 0st floor_flat instructions .
neutral	it '_s a real_shame .
neutral	other_suppliers deliver to my address often without problems .
neutral	as a previously very happy customer i '_d politely suggest you review your courier firm .
neutral	paid_extra for goods to be delivered in two_days never received the goods till a week_later missed the event that i was needing them for even after emails sent to company there was no explaination as to why the goods where late in arriving when i eventually received the goods one set was not working
neutral	overall a good experience with travel_republic with the organisation of the holiday .
neutral	however , the return transfer , supplied by urbis , torremolinos , was marred_by the confirmation fax having the incorrect flight time of the return flight .
neutral	the communication with urbis intimated that this was entirely not their problem as flight data is supplied to them , from london , by travel_republic ... so it was my responsibility to arrange alternative timed transfers .
neutral	if i had missed my scheduled flight owing to an incorrect transfer time it would also have been my responsibility to arrange & pay for alternative flights .
neutral	service companies who receive monies for supplying a service should be accountable for checking the information they supply and confirming correctly to the client - not shrugging it off as not their fault ...!
neutral	i ordered 0 of the same bouquet to be sent as ' thank_you ' gifts to a number of people at different_addresses , all on behalf of a charity .
neutral	it was a little annoying to need to re - set the bouquet size to ' standard ' every time to order the right value ( as it defaults to the more_expensive ' medium ') and there was a technical_issue with the message on the final one which for some reason wouldn_'_t ' attach ' to the correct order , but which online customer_services sorted ( took approx 00_mins ).
neutral	i would normally expect some positive_feedback from the recipients but i have only heard from one whose flowers were very poor quality , with some stems broken and blooms " nearly dead " - very disappointing and a poor reflection on the charity '_s intentions .
neutral	i sincerely_hope that the lack of feedback from the other 0 is not down to awkwardness on their part if they have received similarly poor quality flowers .
neutral	i got a good price for my iphone 0 and got the packaging to send it to enviro_phone really quickly .
neutral	unfortunately i then had to wait a week from them accepting the phone to sending the check ( i '_m not 000_% sure why it couldn_'_t be sent straight out ).
neutral	it then took 0_days for the cheque to arrive after being sent so i ended_up waiting nearly 0_weeks for my money .
neutral	i have used ebay before to buy quite a few items but my use of ebay has tailed off recently .
neutral	many of the sellers prices , particularly for books , are way over what you would pay if you looked at other_sites .
neutral	same as for dvds .
neutral	however , there are still bargains to be had .
neutral	return transfer in mallorca didn_'_t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi_fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .
neutral	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
neutral	i think it '_s important people realise resorthoppa are an agency for transfer companies so its not entirely their fault if a company is bad , they obviously do need to scrap some in mallorca altogether if they don_'_t sort things out though .
neutral	we followed the procedure of confirming our pickup times etc .
neutral	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
neutral	well 00 . 00 came and went .
neutral	got to 0 . 00 and we started_panicking , tried to call the " emergency contact number " over 00 times and it just had an announcement in spanish on the other end .
neutral	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency_number was just a mobile phone turned off .
neutral	it was like this all day .
neutral	we tried every other number that funnily_enough stopped_working , even_though it was fine the day before when we used it to confirm our pickup times .
neutral	it was like the transfer supplier had decided to just take a day off and turn off all their phones .
neutral	customer service has_been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn_'_t provided .

neutral	customer service has_been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn_'_t provided .
neutral	this was my first experience of using this supplier and i was disappointed .
neutral	incorrect items were received .
neutral	the customer service was ok but i have been put to the inconvenience of having to repackage and go to the post_office to send the goods back , await their receipt and then wait for the correct goods to arrive .
neutral	meanwhile i will probably go and buy some of the same product from boots .
neutral	great service and price , but my perfume wasn_'_t wrapped in celephane and didn_'_t seem to smell the same as it does in the shops , so i have to wonder_if it is really a genuine_article .
neutral	why wasn_'_t it sealed ?
neutral	flowers were completely_different
neutral	please email receipt / invoice for my purchase as it wasn_'_t included in the package on delivery
neutral	my first prescription was dealt_with quickly and efficiently .
neutral	my second took about three_weeks to come with no contact about the delay until initiated by me .
neutral	pharmacy first insisted it had been posted but it never arrived .
neutral	eventually they consented to sending the package again .
neutral	my most_recent prescription was in fact out of date , a fact i had not noticed .
neutral	nothing arrived for two_weeks and i finally received a phone_call saying they had been trying to contact me to tell me this .
neutral	from then on the matter was sorted and the service was good .
neutral	my complaint on both these occasions relates to the lack of communication , indeed on the recent occasion their website record showed my prescription as having been checked two_weeks before they phoned me .
neutral	why the delay ?
neutral	i could have needed these items urgently .
neutral	they had both my phone number and email on record .
neutral	whatever they said , nobody had phoned me before , ( my phone records all numbers ).
neutral	the people who work there seem very nice , and their prices for private_prescription items are very reasonable .
neutral	but quick and efficient contact where there are problems is needed .
neutral	a week_ago i ordered a crocodile costume for my son '_s school assembly .
neutral	i needed it quickly so i chose next_day delivery .
neutral	sure enough the costume arrived bright and early the next_morning - no_complaints there , although i do think £ 0 for delivery is a bit much !
neutral	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
neutral	anyway , my son came home from school eager to try the costume on before the assembly .
neutral	normally i dont mind him wearing fancy_dress at home but this was a big mistake .
neutral	the costume shed little green hairs everywhere he went .
neutral	a week ( and several_times around with the vacuum ) later and i '_m still finding them .
neutral	so straight after the assembly i had to lock the costume away in a cupboard and it won_'_t be seeing the light of day again .
neutral	a [ 0 - year - old ] crying shame !
neutral	have used glasses_direct for a few_years_now , but am disappointed with the difference is fit with various pairs .
neutral	the first pair was too loose , the second_pair far too tight , and the third pair , again too loose .
neutral	( i feel like goldilocks !)
neutral	one pair was also slightly wonky ( although not with the home_trial pair ) i am happy with the price , the level of service , the swift delivery , and also the product in all other ways though .
neutral	please can you confirm the reason the flowers i ordered were not per the description online when they were delivered .
neutral	i spent a while looking for the right ones and received a picture last night from the recipient and rather_than being pleased she said they were very pink .
neutral	i picked the flowers on the basis of the colour .
neutral	i needed to know why they were not what i paid for .
neutral	the quality of the costume was poor as it had laddered before i put it on .
neutral	the eye_mask didn_'_t cover the eyes properly and the paint peeled_off of the belt within an_hour .
neutral	the delivery was really expensive considering what i had to pay for the costume , however , it did arrive within the allotted_time .
neutral	00_minutes check in time is the downside .
neutral	it '_s 00 - 00_minutes everywhere_else in the world and they do fligh on the sky as well .
neutral	i wanted to order kerastase_shampoo .
neutral	i was going to order two but decided to order three as there was a special_offer of a gift .
neutral	however i did not realise that the gift bag was indeed just a slightly crumpled red gift bag to put a gift inside .
neutral	very misleading and totally disappointing .
neutral	i would have ordered two if i had have realised .
neutral	sonia haddad
neutral	i have been shopping online now for some time , i never get my full shop from them , something as basic as cheddar cheese they never have .
neutral	vegetables and fruit are often a day away from putting in the bin and meat sell and use by dates need improving , i often think that because you are a home delivery they think its acceptable to bring you what they would bin and can not sell in the shop .
neutral	i always ask for bags , but half my shop never comes in bags , if you opt for no bags you get extra green points , but i never see any extra green points for my shopping that do not come in bags .
neutral	sent wrong_size had to put in a space piece for them to fit as it would be to much_trouble to send back and wait again
neutral	items all delivered in boxes , lots of waste to dispose of .
neutral	no assistance offered & items impossible for elderly customer to unwrap .
neutral	goods expected to be signed for whilst items still in boxes - so unable to check condition .
neutral	not the best service .
neutral	on the same day furniture arrived from rival company - items unloaded , assembled & positioned - even changed lightbulb in room as customer unable to reach !!!
neutral	stark contrast - hence returned to 0nd shop since for further items .
neutral	i have been with healthy_pets for several_years and decided on renewal to adjust my insurance on my 0 cats .
neutral	now they are not covered for illness until 00 days time .
neutral	i feel this is an insult to loyal_customers and i shall be looking at taking my business elsewhere .
neutral	this penalty is totally unfair to existing_customers and penalises loyalty .
neutral	good price for product but next_day delivery would be appreciated
neutral	good website but not getting the card with my message spoilt things as i had to ask if she received the flowers and balloon
neutral	the wig i received was awful . looked nothing like the picture online or on the box , very clown like and poor quality . the neon beads on the other hand were great , much_better quality than other ones i had seen in a party shop . i don_'_t think i will order from this company again , although the prices were reasonable when postage n packing added on the prices not that different from high_street prices .
neutral	great service but we did not appreciate that the size of the embroidered_logo would be the same regardless of the size of the sweatshirts so on some of them the logo looks enormous and out of proportion .
neutral	if we had known or been advised this would happen we would have made the logo smaller .. one lives and learns !
neutral	very happy with the flowers , but unfortunately the delivery driver did not follow out delivery instructions .
neutral	he knocked at the door , didn_'_t wait and just left the flowers on the door_step .
neutral	the recipient was in , but was given no chance to get to the door .
neutral	for the flowers to be left_outside the front_door after not waiting was unacceptable , as clear_instructions were given to leave them with the next door neighbour if the recipient was not in .
neutral	sadly the one thing that sticks out in my mind is that the lady opened her flowers and found a half packet of smoked menthol cigarettes in her bouquet .
neutral	is this normal ?
neutral	delivery was nearly a week late and no apology or explanation .
neutral	was almost thinking i had dreamt about placing an order !
neutral	normally good experiences but wondering what has happened to some shoes
neutral	i ordered a vintage - look hair_comb for my wedding .
neutral	ordering , payment and delivery were very efficient .
neutral	however when the product arrived i was a little disappointed as it looked rather cheap , and not worth the £_00 i had paid for it .
neutral	i could have picked something like this up at accessorize for a quarter of the price .
neutral	dress came when and how i expected in a bag
neutral	i hung it up for creases to drop before having it taken up as far too long that '_s when i noticed all the loose ends
neutral	sorted them myself as it would take to long to send back etc
neutral	i '_ve bought a measuring_tape in order to make the purchase .
neutral	the waistcoast was the only item that came on a perfect size .
neutral	the jacket was 0 sizes too_big and the trouser 0 size smaller .
neutral	the shirt collar was fine but the rest , gigantic .
neutral	luckily there was fabric to loosen the trouser and i have an amazing tailor who charged me double the prize of the purchase to alterate all 0 items .
neutral	( as i was in a hurry there would be no time to send irt back in order to get the right sizes .)
neutral	product fine , when it arrived .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery and had to wait three_days .
neutral	then had to send it back again as the small size was too large .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	the website was good and i was pleased with the service .
neutral	the bag i ordered was well described and a better price than the other website i found it on but i decided to return it as it was larger than i expected and a little too cumbersome for everyday use .
neutral	i think it is unreasonable to expect people to return an item to the seller within 0_days ( 0 working_days ) as it is not enough time to make a decision and post it back .
neutral	after a lot of confusion i spent money on a return with collect_plus only to realise that it only covers items up to £_00 !
neutral	i still have not maintained whether insurance is an optional_extra ...
neutral	so i sent the item back , at vast expense , with [_link ].
neutral	to summarise , a mostly negative experience .
neutral	i i would like to see a free_returns process .
neutral	but i liked how informative the posting out process was with texts and emails from julesb and [_link ].
neutral	quality of the flowers was good but the flowers weren_'_t delivered to our front_door as we live above a church they were left_outside the church doors rather_than to us even_though we did state that they were for the flat .
neutral	other than that pleased with the service and flowers were very nice and as_described on website .
neutral	when i enquired with yourselves about the warrenty on the product i purchased , you failed to tell myself that it started from date of sale .
neutral	my grandson is not due till mid_december , so he is very unlikely to wear the product out .
neutral	i purchased other items from other_suppliers and was told their warrenties started from date of birth , as expected . i still have other items to purchase , as presents , but alas this problem will override my choice of seller .
neutral	every other aspect or my purchase with yourselves was good .
neutral	okay , a bit disappointed the packaging was wet and damaged . luckily the canvas was unharmed .
neutral	canvas never came with hanging attachments like my previous order .
neutral	but all in all a good service .
neutral	i keep using shop and scan on topcash , but more often than not my requests are refused .
neutral	one of the main_reasons for me to send my children to camp beaumont is for them to make new friends .
neutral	however my youngest_child was stuck in a room with a non - english speaker , on a floor where all the other children were french as well , so she felt very isolated in the evenings , when she had expected to be having fun making new friends .
neutral	i did phone to try and sort this out , but nothing could be done .
neutral	it is quite cruel to put an 0 year_old amongst predominately foreign children , particularly as this was an english camp and she is english .
neutral	all the activities and staff were excellent , as ever , but not the greatest experience for poppy .
neutral	i loved working with the software , it was very intuitive to use and the results you can get are amazingly professional .
neutral	staff there are also v helpful .
neutral	my first book i took about 0_days over it but now i '_ve got much quick using the automated page filler and can finish a 00 page book in around 0 hours .
neutral	the only catch is that the software crashes quite_often , meaning you have to keep re - loading it and sometimes i '_ve lost work that way .
neutral	that '_s the only_reason i didn_'_t give it 0_stars .
neutral	perhaps it '_s because i use a mac although it shouldn_'_t really be a problem .
neutral	i forgot my credit_card so was charged an additional £_000 . 00 for comprehensive insurance .
neutral	no other credit_card could be used other than the named_driver .
neutral	be warned of this .
neutral	i ordered the 0 - seater futon and struggled to put it together .
neutral	i thought it was just that the quality of the tools provided to put it together .
neutral	in the end i had to get a handyman to do it and there was actually a fault with it but we assembled it although have not tried to fold it out .
neutral	i then ordered another futon mattress as the one supplied is quite_thin .
neutral	i had to change my original delivery date and had endless problems with the courier initially turning_up on the wrong day and then not showing up at all despite me comfy_living to re - confirm .
neutral	it was only after calling comfy_living again , and experiencing some attitude from the call_centre agent , that it transpired_that the supplier had gone into_administration and they couldn_'_t supply my mattress .
neutral	i then had to go through the process of getting my refund which was also chaotic .
neutral	i received a picture from the recipient on the 0nd day after flowers were delivered .
neutral	they were very appreciative of the gesture and loved the flowers but it is a very poor bouquet compared to the picture on the website . the flowers look tired , wilted and thrown together haphazardly ..... not at all what i anticipated when choosing the botticelli bliss bouquet !!
neutral	delivery was good and the updates from the company letting_me know when delivery took place appreciated but very disappointed with the finished_product !
neutral	i used topcashback to get £_000 cash_back with orange for phone & broadband and i did this at the beginning of june . i received my cashback today 00nd october which i think is too long to wait .
neutral	i also found the topcashback site lacking in instructions when i tried to find out how i could claim this money and the process to go through on line .
neutral	i am a senior_citizen and not computer_savvy and it was more by luck that i managed to navigate through the site .
neutral	there are no specific instructions and i wonder_if there is an ulterior motive for this - to put you off claiming .
neutral	i won_'_t be using the site again - its too confusing and not worth the hassle .
neutral	sorry but it '_s not for me .
neutral	delivery not on day promised and delivery company not truthful on their tracking record .
neutral	rather disappointed about content of mixed seed order but the birds will be the best critics !
neutral	was happy with the service .
neutral	but it cut out half of the writing i did .
neutral	i was really disappointed with this as it was for my best friends 00th .
neutral	don_'_t know what you could do about that ?
neutral	!
neutral	i haven_'_t booked my holiday yet but the sunnyrentals website is full of lovely properties and easy to use .
neutral	i just had one disappointment as i had found our perfect property but when i contacted the owner i found out that the prices were wrong .
neutral	i told sunny rentals and they got back to me quickly .
neutral	would happily use them to book our holiday .
neutral	generally disappointed with our first villa holiday .
neutral	after arriving at the villa we were met by the villa_plus representative who informed us that only 0 of the 0 villas was prepared for our arrival ..... not great news after a flight with 0 children in tow !
neutral	finally got in villa e at 0 . 00pm ( check - in time 0pm ) we were made aware the cleaners had started at 00am , but there was only 0 ladies to clean 0 villas in 0 hours ??
neutral	the villas are advertised as well stocked with cooking_utensils etc ..... however on the first morning whilst preparing breakfast discovered this was not so , spied a small notice on the kitchen wall to say kitchen articles may be found in the other villas , surely the cleaners should ensure articles are returned so new occupants do not have to go searching out utensils !
neutral	the dishwasher in villa e did not work , was running several hours and failed to empty of wateri mentioned this to the cleaners who said no problem and they set it off again , not sure if there was a ' language ' problem as again the dishwasher was still running 0 hours_later !
neutral	and again was left with water in .
neutral	the general layout of the villas is a poor design .... having the only access from the pool_area through the bedroom doors .
neutral	at last ... the good news !!!
neutral	the pool is lovely and makes up for the disappointment of the ' villas '.
neutral	would i return there ?
neutral	no .
neutral	would i recommend it ?
neutral	no
neutral	disappointed that what was on offer could not be delivered
neutral	i '_m new to electronic train bookings and would prefer to have timetables visible so that i could choose start times for my various journeys with confidence .
neutral	as it was i kept having to re - enter times of my journey to see if they fit with the various connections etc .
neutral	maybe i missed something on the website ?
neutral	once i settled on the times , the actual booking went_smoothly and the tickets or etickets arrived promptly .
neutral	if you '_ve only got a maestro card , you ' re not going to be able to book
neutral	i am not sure who was at fault whether it was royal_mail not delivering the parcel on time or mazuma not checking for it but i never received my instant bank_transfer until over 00 days after i had posted the phone .
neutral	although when enquiring_about what had happened to the phone mazuma were very pleasant .
neutral	a means to a range of removals companies , but brace yourself for the onslaught of various bods ( good , bad and indifferent ) getting in touch via phone and email and then chasing endlessly .
neutral	a simple way of getting a hire_car just as long as you don_'_t get diverted to another airport and try to pick_up a car from there .
neutral	in limoges you '_ll be told you can '_t have the one car they had spare because " someone might need it !"
neutral	once at poitiers , with the car in our possession it was plain_sailing ; clean , easy to drive , well_maintained .
neutral	i received tickets only two_days before the concert and that was on a friday .
neutral	i had been sent two tickets instead of one which didn_'_t really matter to me , but did it mean that someone_else lost out ?
neutral	you could only telephone after 00 . 00hrs and by then it would have been impossible to sort_out .
neutral	they need a representative at the concert to sort_out late ticket problems .
neutral	trying to sort_out by the website was very time_consuming as they required scans of tickets etc , fine if you have a scanner !
neutral	i gave up in the end .
neutral	i have used animed before and been very happy with service and speed of delivery , but this time it took them about a week to tell me that i needed a new prescription .
neutral	it '_s a good job that i have a good vet who was able to do a new script for me that day .
neutral	it will be better next time
neutral	though the lenses came with the perfect prescription , the frames are quite flimsy and one of the four_pairs i purchased was so bent that i can '_t wear them .
neutral	i did get four_pairs of glasses for £_00 . 00 and 0 pairs were ok , but i did expect them all to be wearable .
neutral	travelling with different carriers , baggage_allowance very difficult to understand
neutral	great product and swiftly delivered .
neutral	however , the box was basically battered with a gaping gap in the top of it .
neutral	there was no packaging whatsoever , so the picture of the product on the box was entirely visible .
neutral	as i was not home , it was left with my neighbour , who i do not know , but who now knows that i am expecting since she saw exactly_what i had bought !
neutral	not the best really .
neutral	sorry homebase but i i am just about to contact your customer service department .
neutral	i ordered two coolie natural uplighters which were delivered today ( 00 march_0000 ).
neutral	they came in a sturdy_box with bubble_wrap , but , unfortunately , one of them has_been damaged --- it is creased and i am not prepared to use it .
neutral	hopefully homebase will put things right .
neutral	apart_from that they would appear to be as advertised .
neutral	nothing to do with the product but down to the packaging and despatch
neutral	good overall service .
neutral	would be better if you could book seats together .
neutral	well it started off being a really cool expereience i was ordering the pc i was wanting and looked for , for ages .
neutral	then when i ordered it i asked if it was ok and the chap on the phone said he would amend a couple of things to make it cheaper but still do the same .
neutral	so when he sent me the improved ( or so i thought ) spec i questioned_why he had put on it an older graphics_card ( gtx 000 instead of gtx 000 0gb ) he said the 000 would perform better .
neutral	so i took his advice only to find out later on from a few good sources that the chap obviously didnt know what he was on about so i had to call back and amend it .
neutral	fortunately for me i managed to speak to a lovely lady_who helped_me no end and got me the right spec i required .
neutral	so you could say the experience was a bit of a roller_coaster i would go back again but would not allow them to change my spec i give them .
neutral	received goods day after est .
neutral	delivery date ; 0 emails received over previous 0_days showing the same information with no change to est . delivery date mentioned ?
neutral	i have ordered this kinesiology_tape in varying quantities over the last 0 years and have noticed that the " sticking " quality is not as good as it used to be and had some of my clients refer to the lack of staying_power too . i know the cost of this tape is cheaper_than named_brands but i am using this tape faster so false_economy , i am considering buying elsewhere .....
neutral	disappointed in the product as after a few washes the logo came off the thermal mug .
neutral	not good value for the price i paid for them , i could have bought plain ones for a fraction of the price .
neutral	they were given as a memento for a 0 day running event and the logo washes off !
neutral	the pictures of flowers on the website aren_'_t accurate at all .
neutral	the flowers that were delivered weren_'_t as many as in the pictures .
neutral	the balloons were also very small .
neutral	wasn_'_t very happy with the appearance .
neutral	will have to use someone_else next time .
neutral	but thanks anyway
neutral	my order was delivered very quickly and i was kept_informed of its status with options to change it .
neutral	price was good for the danilon .
neutral	will order again .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i have always found create a badge to be efficient and the quality is excellent .
neutral	my problem this time was that the badges had to be delivered after the date i needed them .
neutral	i was surprised and disappointed to hear that a 00 hour guaranteed delivery could not be arranged , even_though i was willing to pay extra to ensure the badges arrived on time .
neutral	i accept that i should have allowed more time to order them , but unfortunately that was out of my control because the images were coming from another person .
neutral	the other problem i encountered which impacted on timing for delivery is that i couldn_'_t contact anyone by phone .
neutral	however all that aside , i would still use createabadge again .
neutral	i received the wrong charm with aother customers purchase details enclosed and i presume that customer got mine .
neutral	the correct charm was despatched_immediately i made contact but this was after presenting the wrong one as a gift as it came giftwrapped .
neutral	so initialy disappointing but was easily_rectified with little inconvenience to me .
neutral	it '_s got a good range of products and that '_s the main_reason for choosing scubastrore , but it could had some more since i had to order some products from other_places .
neutral	most of the products as a good description , some only in english ; it ´_s not a major_issue for me but i '_ve had some problems understanding some words since i '_m portuguese .
neutral	my major_issue with scubastore was that they took alot of time delivering the products ordered .
neutral	some in the site said to be available and where not , and other '_s said would take about one week for example and the orders i placed only arrived over one month witch was a bit decepointing especialy since in my last order all the products where said to be available .
neutral	the prices are not the cheapest and some stores give the delivery fee '_s after a certain amoun '_t and i '_ve exceded that amount in bouth the orders that i made , so i think that good coustemers should have a incentive to come_back .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
neutral	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain '_t overly upset if it doesn_'_t come .
neutral	i emailed them 0_days ago , took them today to answer .
neutral	they sounded polite , apparently it '_s because of the holiday so there '_s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there '_s no mention on the site ).
neutral	i shall see what_happens from here .
neutral	update
neutral	i received my order a few_days ago and everything is as it was described on the site and came well_packaged .
neutral	however i '_m still annoyed from before .
neutral	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
neutral	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don_'_t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
neutral	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn_'_t exist .
neutral	it '_s an alright shop but isn_'_t anything special .
neutral	the clothes in my opinion can be a hit or miss and some items intended to look expensive are just tacky but have an extra £_00 added on .
neutral	they have some nice stuff because i '_ve bought a jumper there that looked lovely and also a pair of shorts aswell as basics but even these i could buy cheaper elsewhere at the same quality .
neutral	i attempted shopping online with them once last_year but the accidentally ( just bad_luck ) canceled my order but left it a long time before telling_me so half of the stuff i wanted was sold out .
neutral	customer service was okay however they agreed to give me a money off code because of the issue yet i never received this until i had to email them once again asking for it .
neutral	i haven_'_t actually used it yet ( and i assume it will have expired by now ) but it was only 0 %_off anyway and i haven_'_t seen anything online that i '_ve wanted to buy from them since .
neutral	i will shop at there stores from time to time but it just isn_'_t really my favorite shop .
neutral	ok but slow especially with the referral fee , not too good with communication either of keeping you up to date with your claim , i was having to ring to find out where i stood
neutral	we '_ve taken this tour a couple of times on our last 0 visits to london .
neutral	it covers quite a bit , is pleasant and informative .
neutral	the problem that we experienced recently was the following :
neutral	we departed the bus on kensington high_street .
neutral	we asked our driver as to the time of the next bus as we had a business dinner to attend in another part of the city .
neutral	he looked at his schedule and gave_us the times .
neutral	we returned to the stop about 00_minutes prior to the time that we had been given .
neutral	we were surprised to speak w_/ other people who had been waiting for over 00_minutes .
neutral	we waited 00 more and no bus .
neutral	soon , it became_apparent that there would be no bus .
neutral	we had to quickly rush to tube_station ( in the pouring_rain btw ) and find our way to our destination arriving an_hour late for our dinner .
neutral	:(
neutral	i was on hold for 00_minutes once before i got to speak to someone about an item i had ordered .
neutral	my mobile phone bill was through the roof !!!
neutral	!
neutral	wanted red cellophane which i was pleased to see was only
neutral	00 pence .
neutral	sadly , however postage was £ 0 which suddenly ceased being a cheap option to buying from shop .
neutral	as working full time , shopping was not an option .
neutral	also , sadly , cellophane turned_out to be orange not red which made school activity more difficult .
neutral	needed to be red !
neutral	parcel did arrive promptly though .
neutral	this product is cheaper_than ia have found anywhere_else , but the delivery service was disgraceful . this would put me off using fragrance_expert again !
neutral	the flowers were beautiful ... all in bud for longevity .
neutral	they arrived on the day they were supposed to .
neutral	however , compared to the bouquet on display on the website , it looked very small and was a bit_disappointing .
neutral	even when the buds open out , i do not think they will look anything like the picture on the website .
neutral	i can '_t complain_about the service as i received an answer to my question within 00_minutes prior to ordering the flowers .
neutral	just feel disappointed .
neutral	had me worried for a while as delivery as a little late but when it arrived it was great
neutral	so thank_you to the florist who put it together walkers in hanley stoke on trent
neutral	i love my mac .
neutral	even_though its a few_years old now , its my lifeline to the world .
neutral	i love that i don_'_t get the faff of viruses that pc users have , that the technology is reliable , and easy to use .
neutral	i am slightly_disappointed that apple don_'_t have their customer_services sorted though , its the only_thing that keeps them from 0_stars .
neutral	recently i ordered some items from bondra , i have ordered items in the past and had no_issues .
neutral	the service is great , the delivery is quick and discreet , but this time i was massively disappointed to say the least .
neutral	my lingerie was very sexy and fitted , so i threw out the packaging to all my products , not thinking for one minute that my two other items were not going to work .
neutral	i thought at_least one would be ok , but unfortunately no matter_how many_times i tried , there was no action , nothing happening .
neutral	this has not been an issue with bondra before , i have always been happy .
neutral	i guess this time you could say it was very bad_luck i got sent a duff lot and wasted my money .
neutral	frustrating , delivery went_astray , second delivery arrived , box broken and wet !
neutral	this is the second time i have used seranta even the first time was bad but i thought i would try again but i will not use them ever again .
neutral	no compensation offered just an early delivery on the day !!!
neutral	!
neutral	after having such a good experience organising flowers for three work_colleagues recently , i decided i would use this firm to mark my daughter '_s birthday .
neutral	i ordered as normal but went for the extra more delux_bouquet ballon and birthday card .
neutral	the flowers were good quality but not worth the extra paid and the birthday card arrived blank with the message printed on a small gift card .
neutral	the email response was to refund my £ 0 . 00 the price of the card as a " gesture " ?
neutral	i feel a replacement card and chocolates would of been a gesture .
neutral	poor service this time will stick to the simple flowers from now on .
neutral	the product was good value , as the insulation is not happening for a few month , the 00_min check was unstuible to asses the items fully to be completely_satisfied , as there is know way you can take items out of packaging and replace fully back to protect the goods .
neutral	there for i didn_'_t fully check as i didn_'_t what to take the protective_packaging off , as it need to stay protected till insulation , bought because the price in sale was good and the measurements were to my requirements ,
neutral	there was some_confusion_over delivery dates and we received a confirmation_email for a specific delivery date but then started getting email requests asking us to contact you to arrange delivery .
neutral	when i rang about this an_alternative date was agreed but i never got a confirmation message and the original date still appeared against the order number in line .
neutral	consequently we weren_'_t sure if it would actually be delivered on that day .
neutral	it was and the quality was good .
neutral	so in short the product is good but the service / delivery needs to be improved .
neutral	i have been ordering from feel good lenses for years and my lenses were then discontinued .
neutral	i asked them to suggest alternative lenses but they were not very helpful at all .
neutral	they just said they are discontinued and that was it
neutral	the tape does what i want , but i knew it would before i ordered .
neutral	delivery was not great - i paid for the signed for delivery by_accident , entirely my fault .
neutral	i wasn_'_t in when was delivered so got it redelivered to my place of work , where reception is manned from 0 until 0 .
neutral	it was not delivered to work , no card was left .
neutral	i emailed customer_services to complain and they told me to contact the courier company to arrange a redelivery .
neutral	the first delivery was really quick , but to redeliver is a 0 day wait and then by the time i had arranged the third delivery it was well over a week . from placing my order .
neutral	bit of a fiasco , initially my fault but overall not the . best service
neutral	i have blurred_vision in my left eye following the procedure .
neutral	i had to travel to plymouth for aftercare which was a 0 hour round_trip .
neutral	i was not informed this would be the case and had been informed prior the procedure that i could be expected to be seen in exeter .
neutral	when i arrived at plymouth they had not been informed and were unable to gain_access to any of my records despite phonecalls as they should have been .
neutral	i am still_waiting followup from exeter despite leaving messages and feel ultralase have not fulfilled their contract .
neutral	this is very different to the persistant contacts from marketing before i decided to purchase the treatment .
neutral	i will not recommend you .
neutral	have booked a few hotels with this company and sorry but they have competition which is far nicer , cleaner and comfier !
neutral	i stayed in one in aberdeen which was really dirty and the internal restaurant was just awful - however they room was refunded so the customer service in that respect was good .
neutral	haven_'_t really stayed in once since though as put off !
neutral	delivery due to arrive today and didn_'_t .
neutral	they did phone at lunchtime to advise me of that but it doesn_'_t change the fact i '_ll have to pack my entire life in about six hours tomorrow .
neutral	major_issue is that you can '_t book collection until the boxes are delivered .
neutral	i need collection on friday , today is wednesday , delayed delivery now arriving thursday .
neutral	very concerned that i will not get collection friday now and will be homeless with boxes .
neutral	would be better to book delivery and have the option to book collection at the same time ... and , preferably , that these bookings are met
neutral	have already told fine_coffee_club that i like the coffee but the packaging is most annoying .
neutral	each capsule is encased in a little paper pack which has to be torn_open before you can get to the capsule .
neutral	once the pack is opened the capsules do not have any external indication as to strength of coffee inside .
neutral	water_flow through capsules is not nearly as strong or as fast as nespresso and i sometimes have to press the button two or three_times more .
neutral	coffee_club have told me they are working on packaging and external data on capsules .
neutral	until they do this , and advise me accordingly , it is unlikely that i will place any further orders withj them .
neutral	majority of the time i use city_link they show up when booked too , i have however had some instances over the years where courier has not shown up at all to collect and a few occasions they still do not show up for up to 0_days_later even_tho i rebooked them every day .
neutral	when mentioning this to regular drivers they mainly blame agency staff .
neutral	i understand that now and again the drivers workload may be too much and they might not be able to make certain collections , but it would be great if a text or a call was made to advise of this once they realise how far behind they are .
neutral	nice and easy to send of as pre_paid_envelope provided .
neutral	annoyed though as quoted me a price then an_email recieved to offer a lower price because it had minor mark on screen - this is a second_hand phone !!!
neutral	so a few superfisal marks should be expected .
neutral	dont offer 0 price then provide another .
neutral	did accept it though as couldnt be bothered to get it sent back and off to someone_else .
neutral	felt that the more dog_food you had the order should have been slightly cheaper !
neutral	i bought a pink bunny outfit for my little_girl .
neutral	price was ok , delivery was excellent ( if not a little over priced ).
neutral	the most unfortunate thing was when i went to dress my daughter in it i was disturbed to find a used pacifier in one of the legs .
neutral	i contacted the company who offered a replacement , but they did not seem to grasp the fact that i was under the impression that this had been a new item , not a used one .
neutral	unfortunately , due to that incident i would not use this company again .
neutral	i was impressed with the speed of the delivery but was dissapointed that it was the wrong part even_though the web_page said it was compatable .
neutral	i want to returne it and was promised a returne lable by e_- mail but i never recieved it so now i am stuck with the part .
neutral	ford_fiesta durashift seized after 00000 miles bought from jennings middlesbrough as an automatic turns_out it is semi automatic !!!!!
neutral	total repair bill £_000 +.
neutral	when collecting the car which had been washed noticed a note under the wipers informing i had a flat_tyre , this was left on the back of a shopping list obviously left by a kind passer_by from the nearby garden_centre . i cannot_believe that the staff at ford had repaired the car ... hopefully test driven it , washed it and failed to notice or inflate the tyre .
neutral	perhaps the air was too costly !!!
neutral	! not impressed at all
neutral	the milk jug was as ordered , but let '_s face it there cannot be much to be wrong with just a jug !
neutral	web_site was not quite the ticket and the person supposedly in charge of it could have been more on the ball .
neutral	basically everyhting was quite efficient , boarding , loading , unloading etc .
neutral	the shop was ok , quite well stocked .
neutral	but i had not eaten at dover because i was looking_forward to a nice leisurely meal served to me on the top_deck .
neutral	i had tried to book the first_class lounge which i have done in the past , but it seemed to be impossible .
neutral	for me , the holiday begins with a leisurely meal , and a sense of laziness .
neutral	instead , i had to go to the self - service restaurant , where the stuff on offer was really just pub food , and not very appetizing at that .
neutral	i had a feta salad as being the healthiest option , which was ok , but not the " experience " i had been looking_forward to .
neutral	a bit of a disappontment really .
neutral	from the time of ordering the certificates i was kept up to date until i received them .
neutral	a very good service but i would have liked to order more certificates , i only had a choice of 0 .
neutral	i thought i would get 0 certificate and 0 copies but i only got 0 .
neutral	i was extremely pleased when i booked insurance for my daughter , it was very easy and affordable .
neutral	the option of a card that she could carry around instead of paper was great and i decided to go for that too .
neutral	this is where it went wrong .
neutral	it took over 00 days for it to come , and then it only came because i phoned up , and when it arrived the policy number was printed so low down that half of it was cut_off !!
neutral	so then i had to write on the card the policy number .
neutral	now this in itself is not a problem but i had had to pay extra to get a card with all the details on it !!!
neutral	a complete_waste of £ 0 + pounds and unless you can actually print it correctly i would not bother to charge / offer this .
neutral	it has tarnished my recommendation that i would give .
neutral	although i gave the correct number off the lock , the keys did not fit .
neutral	we have now managed to open the cabinet .
neutral	the company kept me informed all the way through the process of ordering and delivery .
neutral	they emailed that the delivery was en_route , what time it would be arrive to the hour and also when the delivery had been made .
neutral	the flowers were only of average quality though .
neutral	some of the open lillies have shed some petals already today despite_being kept in the kitchen , the coolest room .
neutral	mum said that they were nice but not as good as some of the bouquets i had received during my recent illness .
neutral	very disappointed that you can no_longer book through virgin air miles club .
neutral	this was the reason i used the service only .
neutral	i did like shopping on line but its cheaper elsewhere .
neutral	delivery wasnt that quick but ok .
neutral	the coat had two marks on it when it arrived , looked a bit like washing poweder marks .
neutral	the coat is a christmas gift for my daughter so i was concerned if i tried to order another it wouldn_'_t arrive on time so i kept it and had 0 attempts to remove the marks .
neutral	thankfully i have now managed to remove them but i '_m very dissapointed that it arrived in this state when i '_ve paid £_00 for the coat .
neutral	it '_s not like it '_s a cheap purchase !
neutral	we purchased 0 " hangers , but unfortunately the spirit levels were slightly out , and we didn_'_t check these before attaching the hangers to the wall and mirror , therefore adjustments had to be made to the screw_holes on the hangers to make them level up .
neutral	even with the hangers straight by our own spirit_level , the mirror does not sit straight and can be pushed up or down , thereby making it unlevel .
neutral	i would suggest buying a longer_length would resolve this problem .
neutral	website is very clear and the things i ordered came very quickly as said .
neutral	however the returns system isn_'_t great , the wording of the way to return items is quite aggressive in terms of the condition .
neutral	its also really confusing as theres no detail of how to actually return an item or a returns_form .
neutral	i have placed an order on - line i have had no contact made to me , with details of tracking my order or confirmation of receiving order .
neutral	i am now wondering have i placed an order with you and where is it ?
neutral	ordered a 00ft air king classic trampoline for my sons christmas_present .
neutral	good points :- the trampoline came on the day it was promised - quick free delivery - no_hassle .
neutral	bad_points - boxes in terrible condition , ripped and dirty .
neutral	as this was to be wrapped up for christmas it made the presents look 0nd_hand .
neutral	couldnt erect the trampoline until 00th_december due to the rain and weather_conditions .
neutral	imagine the disappointment to find a spring missing from the kit and the jump mat has 0 holes in it .
neutral	good point - the company took my complaint seriously and replaced the mat and spring without_question .
neutral	they were able to take my complaint on 00th_dec despite this being a bank_holiday .
neutral	bad point - it took 00 days to send the replacement items .
neutral	we are of the opinion that the trampoline we got sent was possibly a store reject or a 0nd_hand one that someone_else had returned .
neutral	the padding that covers the springs is torn where the straps are to be tied to the trampoline frame .
neutral	i can see where someone has tried to re - sew the straps on to make it look like they were never torn in the 0st place .
neutral	i cant be bothered to go back and get the padding replaced too as this will mean our sons will again have to wait to use their christmas_present .
neutral	the mat had 0 holes and a spring was missing .
neutral	whilst the company have rectified the issues positively it should never have been sent out in this condition .
neutral	was it a new trampoline ?
neutral	i guess i '_ll never find out for sure .
neutral	i received my pen very quickly , i got a phone_call within minutes of placing the order online to check how i wanted the engraving .
neutral	major let_down was the pen arrived with a few little scratches on it .
neutral	pleased with product .
neutral	delivery took over a week .
neutral	advert said 00 per_cent off product - but no code available - so couldn_'_t access .
neutral	contacted company , but they weren_'_t really interested .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use this company again .
neutral	i '_ve ordered several_times with crownbrush and have mostly been quite happy with the service however the quality of the products can be very hit or miss .
neutral	you never really know if the brush will be as_described because the website can be vague with information about each product .
neutral	would love more pictures on each brush .
neutral	i would use them again .
neutral	some transactions are great with topcashback , some are declined totally , one transaction i am still_waiting to sort_out from over 00 months_ago !!
neutral	!
neutral	used site and discount_code easter00 but it did not work , feel conned .
neutral	i needed a second laptop and after_spending much time on the internet i found pixmania was by far the best price .
neutral	however i never received the e_- mail telling_me my dispatch no . and that it was on it '_s way .
neutral	after 0_days i rang them only to speak to a man in india who said they couldn_'_t deliver it and it had been returned to the ware_house .
neutral	i explained that there was always someone here so he said i '_d need to sort it out with the delivery company . he said ring the no .
neutral	on the card - i said there was no card as no one had come . he then gave_me a no .
neutral	for the delivery company and a ref .
neutral	no ..
neutral	he gave_me a non exsistant no .
neutral	so i had to find it out myself .
neutral	when i did get through she said no one had delivered it yet , it was still in the office with her . i should have been able to speak to someone in the uk who knew what they were talking_about .
neutral	i felt they weren_'_t interested .
neutral	my mum_loved the flowers when she eventually got them at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	the recipient_loved the flowers but unfortunately wasn_'_t in when they were delivered .
neutral	a neighbour had seen the delivery van and watched the person just dump the parcel outside my friends door so went and took them in for her and left her note , i had a text saying they had been left_securely at the front_door , i don_'_t call just being propped against front_door securely !!!
neutral	!
neutral	attended the funeral so saw the sheaf myself .
neutral	it was nicely made but the quality of the flowers was not good value for money - only one rose and the rest carnations and chrysanths - not what was advertised and what i paid for .
neutral	had been to another funeral a week earlier where there were many white / cream roses so it cannot be a seasonal issue .
neutral	would hesitate to order this way again .
neutral	nespresso offers better coffee , better delivery and better pods .
neutral	therefore i am going back to them .
neutral	did a trial run 0st time and couldnt_believe_how good the service was .
neutral	ordered for birthday and this time they didnt arrive until 00 : 00 - not great when you want to surprise someone with flowers and the day '_s nearly over .
neutral	havent_seen the flowers yet but recipient was pleased .
neutral	the man who came was fantastic .
neutral	his van was spotless , done a great job no_fuss etc just couldn_'_t do the tracking and i '_m still_waiting for a refund or someone to call to sort something ?
neutral	?
neutral	but i '_d still use you again
neutral	the parcel came when it said it would .
neutral	however , when purchasing i followed the measurements on the website to pick the right size .
neutral	after being measured to size by 0 different people ( with the same outcome ) i purchased the size that matched my measurements according to the guide .
neutral	when the coat arrived it was way to small for me and was no where near what it said it would be .
neutral	delivery did not meet the final 00 day deadline and i chose a 0 wheel vehicle to make it easier for the company to deliver which_meant i did not receive discounts .
neutral	other_companies have managed to deliver in a large tanker .
neutral	no calls were made to me informing_me that i would not get my delivery and i had to spend time chasing it .
neutral	bearing in mind that the account is paid in_advance and there is very little security in paying by debit_card i was becoming_increasingly worried_about my delivery .
neutral	the prices quoted are not any different to local companies who all provide a more efficient service with an account you settle once delivery has_been made by credit_card at no extra_cost .
neutral	ordered my bed and was told i would receive it the following_day , postage free and it was , but was a little surprised that it was flat_pack .
neutral	i did as instructions said and checked the list to find out that a few pieces were missing , so phoned mattress next_day who were very helpful but said that parts have to come from manufacturers and im still_waiting , almost a week_later .
neutral	los precios eran buenos aunque la entrega en 0 dias laborables es un poco largo en otras paginas entregan con mas rapidez
neutral	i had ordered flowers and chocolates for my mum '_s birthday and paid for delivery before 00am , so that she would not have to stay in all day .
neutral	however , the flowers didn_'_t arrive as requested .
neutral	serenata quickly offered me a full_refund , but i still didn_'_t know where the flowers and chocolates were because the tracking_system didn_'_t recognise the order number or mum '_s postcode .
neutral	after several emails back and forth the delivery was made at midday .
neutral	mum was very happy with the gifts but it had been a very stressful 0 hours for both of us .
neutral	next time , if i use serenata again , i '_ll just settle for the free delivery and save my blood_pressure !
neutral	my experience with oak_furniture_land was on the whole very good .
neutral	i found the sales_representative very welcoming and helpful .
neutral	he helped_us choose what was right for us without being_pushy .
neutral	there were only two annoying problems .
neutral	one is the delivery charge .
neutral	i spent well over a thousand_pounds and you would have thought they would have delivered for free , after all , there are free delivery advertisements everywhere in the shop .
neutral	the catch is you only get free delivery if it is left to their discretion and we were told it could be up to a month , whereas if we paid £_00 we could have the order the following week .
neutral	a con i think as the van was coming to my area next week anyway .
neutral	also their returns_policy is a bit_strange , you have to pay to have them pick_up the returned item even if the item is small enough to bring it back to the shop yourself .
neutral	the other problem i had was with the packing .
neutral	there was just so so much of it .
neutral	it took us hours to unpack a wardrobe , we had bits of cardboard and small beads of polystyrene everywhere .
neutral	it made such a mess of our house and garden and had to make two trips to the tip to dispose of it .
neutral	not much of a complaint really , but no unpacking service is offered , so we had no choice but to struggle .
neutral	all in all i would use oak furnture land again as the quality of the product is very good and the staff very helplful .
neutral	i thought the delivery service would be first_class , but i placed order last_week and i still_haven_'_t received my order
neutral	it was dispatched quickly with greats comms but i chose the collect service as the postage was really expensive according to the delivery time options ... it was listed as ' active for less ' which is a gym but no instruction was given that it wasn_'_t at the gym but weird automated metal lockers near the gym on the same industrial_estate !
neutral	i think you need much_better comms about this service ...
neutral	unfortunately , the 0 boxes that the products came in were all damaged .
neutral	these were presents , and not packed tightly enough .
neutral	otherwise , happy with the quick and good service .
neutral	isent you 0 boxes one of dvd '_s the other cd '_s i have only received one cheque .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	i ordered diet_chef on 0th_august it did not arrive till the 00th . it was supposed to be delivered on the 0th .
neutral	i have had numerous orders from diet_chef to this address so to claim they could not find the house is not true . they also had a mobile number & a house number .
neutral	diet_chef is a good product that works but their deliver men need sorting_out
neutral	this cottage was booked by me for my mum and dad plus an aunt and uncle .
neutral	generally they were very pleased with the gardener '_s cottage at littlethorpe .
neutral	ideal_location for touring yorkshire and next door to the show at newby hall that weekend .
neutral	( the main_reason for their visit .)
neutral	faults mentioned were - no mirror / dressing_table in second bedroom and secondary glass pane in window was cracked and repaired by tape .
neutral	sill looked as though it could of been used as a seat but someone lent on window as no barrier not to . felt as though it was a lesser quality room .
neutral	i '_ve been on vodafone for years and still marvel about the user_interface mess that is their website .
neutral	it pains me every time i have to log in to view my bills .
neutral	also , there seems to be no way to sign off from repeat offender ' vip ' promotional text_messages and emails .
neutral	must_try harder with the online but decent coverage and contract plans .
neutral	the goods i have purchased were not as good as i thought they looked .
neutral	the serviettes do not match the plates , and i was hoping to have every thing look good for my daughters baby_shower .
neutral	even_though my parcel was within the weight allowance , and the measurements were all under the allowance , the female person at the mccolls store in newton_abbot when i took the parcel in was starting to complain that that parcel was as large as it was .
neutral	i told her that it was all within the limits , so she had no reason to complain .
neutral	i told her off really - but i shouldn_'_t have had to .
neutral	i am a female , and although it was quite large , it was easy to lift and move , so her attitude was very bad .
neutral	not a particularly pleasant . transaction .
neutral	this has happened before in other collect_plus shops ... they seem to not like having a large parcel in the way .
neutral	it is a shame because other than these people taking the parcels ( that often seem to have resentful / bad attitudes ) the collect_plus service has always been excellent .
neutral	it didn_'_t turn out that good as the sample on the website has shown .
neutral	the picture is not clear at all but because it was a deal , i just kept it .
neutral	if i paid full price for it , i will surely be more disappointed .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from e_- florist before , so used them again when i needed a same day delivery .
neutral	i '_m_sure you used to be able to track delivery , but i couldn_'_t seem to do it this time .
neutral	so i have no idea whether the flowers have ever been delivered .
neutral	the ones i ordered last time were lovely .
neutral	the coffee has_improved in taste over the last_year and is starting to work better in a nespresso_machine .
neutral	i got a few frantic calls because they had read the 0th_may as the 0th_march and thought i wanted to come in the day i had booked on the day
neutral	i went for the buy one get one free offer , however , it should have been 00 . 00 and it comes up at 000_pounds , why , i contacted them through live_chat and they told me that the tyre is free but the fitting is not , i still bought the tyres , even_though i think this should have been made clearer , i am having the tyres_fitted on tuesday , just hoping for a good experience then , will keep you informed .
neutral	the product was not as ordered from the web_site and when i phoned i was told that the product i had ordered did not exist .
neutral	a little ' tidying up ' of the web_site might be in order .
neutral	otherwise , good service , quick delivery and easy return .
neutral	the product is a good price and my dog seems to enjoy the sausages very much .
neutral	but i was informed that delivery would be on one day - so i stayed in all day - but didn_'_t arrive until the following_day .
neutral	the deal was excellent .
neutral	sadly the tickets didn_'_t arrive and it took a couple of telephone_calls to sort it out .
neutral	however , it all ended well as far as the theatre was concerned .
neutral	however the hotel as atrocious .
neutral	i would suggest that you do not include this one as an option as i would be tempted not to use your site in case other hotels are of the same standard .
neutral	it was dirty , wallpaper coming off the walls , windows that didn_'_t close , or open properly .
neutral	carpets with holes in .
neutral	dreadful .
neutral	different brands each time of my regular medication .
neutral	even_though my prescription is always in monthly multiples , i often receive bits of some cut up monthly sheets , or loose pills in a brown pot , which i am worried come from lots of different sources , basically left overs from someone_elses prescription .
neutral	i would prefer to receive complete monthly sheets to help regulate my intake .
neutral	even better would be from a supplier who provides a months drugs in 0 even rows of 0 !
neutral	i used this service for the first time today for 0 parcels and it was very easy to do but if i decide to use them again i would not go back to the turbary wine shop in ferndown to drop them off .
neutral	the person_who_served me , i believe the owner was talking on his phone and not once did he acknowledge me or speak he just took the parcels and scanned them , pointed for me to sign and gave_me the receipt .
neutral	i must_admit i thought this was extremely rude .
neutral	i have used this type of service before but not this company and i would be very hard_pushed to go there again
neutral	villa_plus are very efficient and the location , privacy and space of the villa is excellent - as is the pool and the cleaning service but things that we were not happy with :-
neutral	the villa has satellite_tv but it would make it far more enjoyable if there was also a sky package as not all of us go out in the evening / most evenings .
neutral	a pool_table is advertised but it is of very poor quality , the baize is too slack , the cues are unsuitable and the cover leaks .
neutral	in the double room the mattress is about 0 " to narrow for the bed_base
neutral	the kitchen is very poorly stocked with only the minimum and does not have such items as cooking dishes , a colander .
neutral	in fact , there were only a few tea spoons - which i find very disconcerting given the fact that we pay a substantial_amount for insurance_cover for breakages etc .
neutral	the villas should be checked for completeness and replenished for each rental_period .
neutral	sloppy things let it down such as having 0 white light_bulb and 0 yellow light_bulb the bathroom and using light_bulbs which
neutral	do not fit the fitting and as such are unpleasant on the eye .
neutral	i thought that these mats would be a bit heavier quality than they were and i suppose time will tell in relation to how hard_wearing they are .
neutral	the mats are well finished however and the contrasting stitching looks well .
neutral	i placed an order in basket , stated date of delivery went to place order and instead of 0 there were 0 in the basket , i removed 0 and then went to , payment , when i completed this i noticed the date had altered to the next_day delivery i tried to edit this and was unable to do this , i then sent a message to confirm date of delivery but never_heard_anything , until i got a text the following_day to say the flowers had been delivered !
neutral	they were for an 00th_birthday on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
neutral	easy to get in touch , very reasonable_prices but it takes a while to receive the prescription_medication as they are not stored on premises .
neutral	if you are not in a hurry , go_ahead .
neutral	quite a long time from the mement i oredered and received my parcel .
neutral	no phonecall which i requested in delivery notes ....
neutral	guinea_pig food made by excel so great quality but hay i ordered very fine , poudery , very dissapointing .
neutral	packaged nicely .
neutral	might order naggets again but not the hay
neutral	i was very happy with the price however when my item was delivered it was missing a cable therefore i ended_up spending a lot more than i wanted to and really regreted buying it .
neutral	however i am now with everything as the whole item could not have worked ,
neutral	i just wish i didnt have to spend the extra money !
neutral	also wasnt happy when i had no reply after stating something was missing .
neutral	not as expected - bit disappointed as didn_'_t have my favourite flowers which is why i chose the specific bouquet called princess as shown on teleflorist website .
neutral	probably would have had the same at half the price if i '_d ordered the moonlight bouquet .
neutral	i suppose the florist is limited in what they have and what percentage they receive from teleflorist .
neutral	i bought with 00_%_off which was probably passed_onto the florist so less allowance for the flowers they had to supply .
neutral	i will enjoy the flower none the less .
neutral	won_'_t be in a hurry to buy via teleflorist again .
neutral	ordered 000 personalised xmas cards which are great and arrived 0_days_later .
neutral	also ordered pack of 00 with different picture & message , unfortunately i received someone_else '_s xmas cards .
neutral	phoned up a few_days_later as i was away when order arrived and was told they would re - print & resend , that was last thursday .
neutral	if they don_'_t arrive tomorrow , i will probably miss the last posting day - i will have to send 0st_class & hope they arrive in time for xmas subject to the cards actually arriving with me ,
neutral	amazing value , and very fast delivery
neutral	bought these shoes for a christmas_present for my step mum .
neutral	she specifically_asked for the shoes and i looked on clark '_s and then debenhams and they had sold out on both !
neutral	i read good reviews for this website so when i found them i was buzzing !
neutral	on receiving the shoes i was truly disappointed with the packaging they came in - as a present i wanted the box to be perfect_condition and instead it '_s completely battered and even been stuck together with some cello tape !
neutral	when paying £_00 for shoes you expect better_than this !
neutral	she shoes themselves are okay - a little bashed but they ' re acceptable !
neutral	not quite sure if i '_d order from website again - maybe if elsewhere was sold out again !
neutral	i recently ordered a hat from missguided and paid for next_day delivery because i needed it for the weekend .
neutral	however , it did not come the next_day ... or the day after that !
neutral	i went to london on saturday_morning and it was delivered that afternoon .
neutral	i didn_'_t find this acceptable and demanded a payment for my refund ( as they normally take £ 0 off you for refund ).
neutral	i was really disappointed that i couldn_'_t have my hat , until i got home and realised that it was rubbish quality anyway - it was all misshapen and not worthy of wearing .
neutral	i normally buy with missguided and have no problem so i '_m not trying to put people off - just a warning not to buy hats or hold out hope for next_day delivery ( when i wasn_'_t in a rush for my goods i paid for standard delivery and received 0_days_later !
neutral	).
neutral	i feel the return of items is fiddly and discouraging .
neutral	let_down on dates .
neutral	one operative left more damage than when he started , i . e .
neutral	shutters no_longer shut .
neutral	damaged paintwork .
neutral	window_lock actually ' lifted ' consider wrong lock fitted my husband later repaired this himself .
neutral	considering overall cost would have thought these relatively minor_issues should never occur .
neutral	would also have expected poor puttying to have been replaced , where necessary , as_opposed to the obviously damaged and broken as we have leaks in at_least a dozen window panes .
neutral	lovely worktop , good value and delivered in good time .
neutral	sadly had 0 small_dent on but as it wasn_'_t unwrapped within a week as our joiner wasn_'_t ready to put it on the kitchen , we had no come_back .
neutral	i did send an_email with picture but sadly had no further response .
neutral	i did get good prompt service but if you ' re not an experienced tradesperson then i think they need more experienced help and advice in measuring etc as we had a few errors which i feel could have been avoided with a bit better advice from them .
neutral	cabin fabulous quality and good value , delivered quickly from phone_call , but customer service awful .
neutral	don_'_t reply to emails sent to customer_services unless it '_s a sale !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	easy to find airparks , we did not have to wait long for the bus to transfer us to the airport and both drivers were friendly and helpful , our car was ready for us to collect despite our flight being early .
neutral	the only_negative was the appalling way we were spoken to on our arrival by the receptionist .
neutral	she was extremely rude and most_unhelpful and i found it unacceptable to have listen to the ' f ' word being used repeatedly whilst moaning to other staff about her job .
neutral	the order process was very simple but at the checkout it was clear as to whether it would be immediate delivery or a date could be chosen .
neutral	given that they were large pieces of furniture i expected a call or an update to the position .
neutral	i received a text and email at 00 . 00 on the day of delivery with no earlier warning stating it would be between 0 and 0 . unfortunately the messages were not picked_up due to working .
neutral	i found a card in the letterbox with a number to call which was not in use , i then via the internet found a mobile number rang it left a message and no response .
neutral	i then emailed and then received a response with revised delivery date .
neutral	the goods were well_wrapped and delivered when they stated they would on the revised time .
neutral	( again this time i had to dial into check the time expected as was not given email or text )
neutral	i purchased a wardrobe with a drawer beneath .
neutral	i didn_'_t realise at point of sale that the unit comes in two_halves and is delivered fully wrapped in cardboard and polystyrene which you , the customer , is expected to unwrap and put_together .
neutral	printing on the packaging warns that if the packaging is damaged the unit cannot be returned , but i defy_anyone to remove the huge_amount of packing intact .
neutral	placing the hanging wardrobe on the drawer_unit was difficult as the unit is extremely heavy , and there were no instructions on how to use the bracket that would hold these together .
neutral	in the end we rang customer_services for advice .
neutral	the wardrobe is lovely , undamaged and excellent quality of build .
neutral	however unless you have some muscle in the family you can call on to help , you '_ll never manage the placing in_situ .
neutral	not bad because i have not got any email
neutral	great bags and good price .
neutral	however the courier delivery service leaves a bit to be desired .
neutral	they left my bags between my wheelie bins and didnt let_me know this .
neutral	i have no idea when they arrived and we have had heavy_snow and they are quite sodden .
neutral	we only found them when we put the bins out .
neutral	good service but postage cost is very high
neutral	the long_stay car_park surfacing needs improved towards the far end ( away from the airport_terminal ).
neutral	i had to leave my car there as there were no other spaces .
neutral	i also returned to find the car surrounded_by fairly deep water on all sides - not ideal !
neutral	i have never found a place where you could sell your books and dvds you do not use anymore .
neutral	i sold a few books and got a good sum of money .
neutral	i like that you dont have to spend any money for post .
neutral	good range but rather expensive .
neutral	quick delivery , i was kept_updated with progress of my order .
neutral	packaging was very over the top , vast quantity of packaging and huge volume of polystyrene packaging used when air bags would have been much_better .
neutral	i recycled all the cardboard but not able to recycle the polystyrene .
neutral	i will not by purchasing from this company again unless they switch to a move environmentally_friendly packaging material .
neutral	great website , easy to use and understand .
neutral	delivery service was very poor on my recent_purchase , disappointing .
neutral	i order alll my beauty products on line and usually received goods within five days .
neutral	still_waiting after nine days
neutral	i just wanted some perfume for work so didn_'_t want to pay a lot so i spent under_£_00 on 0 bottles of well_known perfume .
neutral	i received them and loved them , the only problem was that the bottles were discoloured , as if oil had been spilled on them .
neutral	there was a kind of rainbow effect on the first bottle i opened so i thought it was the style of bottle and it was supposed to be like that but when i opened the other two bottles , they were the same .
neutral	whist this is ok because the perfume was for me , i wouldnt be 000_% comfortable buying them as gifts as you don_'_t know what the bottle is going to be like unless you open the box .
neutral	i will always buy my perfume from you but maybe i would be reluctant to buy perfume i would want to gift .
neutral	fab company and easy friendly to use site just so disappointed with the display and quality of the flowers delivered abroad .
neutral	looked a little tired and tacky and wasn_'_t that cheap !
neutral	i ordered a half drive socket set for my other_halfs birthday .
neutral	i chose to hold the product so it was delivered on the monday 0rd_march .
neutral	i then realised after_placing the order that that was when it would be despatched .
neutral	so i rang up and spoke to a very helpful man called dave .
neutral	he explained to me that the order wouldn_'_t be despatched until monday so he changed the order so it would be delivered on the monday .
neutral	i was really pleased with that .
neutral	monday came and no sign of the parcel .
neutral	i had no email either .
neutral	tuesday came and still no sign .
neutral	so tuesday_evening i rang up .
neutral	i spoke to a very unhelpful lady and explained my situation .
neutral	she told me to be patient and it should arrive tomorrow .
neutral	i was quite annoyed at this point cos it was a birthday_present that was meant to be for monday .
neutral	wednesday came and still no sign of the parcel .
neutral	so wednesday_afternoon i rang again .
neutral	i spoke to another lady_who was quite rude also .
neutral	she then put me on hold so she could contact the warehouse to see if they knew of it '_s wear abouts .
neutral	after being on hold for 0 minutes , she told me that my item had been sent out for delivery but the delivery label had come off the parcel so it had been returned to the warehouse .
neutral	by this point id had enough , nobody had informed me of this delay .
neutral	i wanted to cancel my order however she guaranteed that the product would be delivered tomorrow .
neutral	the item arrived at 0pm thursday_afternoon only 0_days late !!
neutral	i am disappointed at the service i had although i understand it was an accident .
neutral	my other half uses your company often to buy tools for his company .
neutral	however i will not be recommending you to others and will not be ordering from you again .
neutral	the product was excellent just a shame about your customer service !
neutral	the trip itself was ok , i upgraded to commodore class and as it was my husbands_00th_birthday and also decided a couple of days prior to book a meal in the steak house and take_advantage of the pre_- book discount .
neutral	boarding and cabin were perfect , we looked through the menu in our cabin and decided what to have , when we got to the restaurant we were given different menus .. strange we thought but the lady explained our pre_- booked meal had to be chosen from the " a " menu , so we were fine to do that .
neutral	we enjoyed our meal along with a couple of drinks and then given a bill for drinks ( which we expected ) and an additional_cost for food , we had chosen from the menu we were given , but apparently there was only one meal the pre_- book discount referred to !!
neutral	total_cost for 0 prawns and 0 steaks and 0 drinks came to 000 . 00 euro !!
neutral	!
neutral	we took this up with staff explaining about the menu in the cabin , after some time we were refunded all money additional including drinks which we were happy about .
neutral	sometime later we returned to the cabin , went to look at the menu and it had gone , we were furious that someone had been in our cabin and reported this to security , who called the restaurant manager to see us , after much discussion it was admitted that they had taken the menu and sent us a bottle of wine to the cabin by way of an_apology .
neutral	twice in one night we found ourselves complaining and this totally_spoilt the occasion of my husbands_birthday which we had spent along time planning and looking_forward to .
neutral	i have travelled many_times on this ferry and always have a pleasant journey but very sad about this one ... wont_be booking a meal again as its abit of a rip - off !
neutral	!
neutral	item was packaged well in bubble_wrap , with a speedy delivery .
neutral	however i did expect the item to be boxed .
neutral	being a gift , it was a little_disappointing that it wasn_'_t .
neutral	it was sent to the wrong location and i had to follow it up but when it arrived it was fine .
neutral	good communication , did turn_up later than_expected .
neutral	flowers seemed a lot smaller_than the picture , but are very nice .
neutral	really good quality clothes but rubbish customer service .
neutral	next time i '_ll go to the shop .
neutral	i placed a large order and filled my box using the online scale that indicates how full the box is .
neutral	unfortunately the box fell_apart somewhere along the delivery process and also a tin of golden syrup burst / leaked and left everything sticky .
neutral	my order was delivered in a series of plastic_bags that the bfpo staff put it in to contain the mess , i did receive all the items but in a very messy condition .
neutral	the bottles of robinsons juice are well_packaged with each wrapped in bubble_wrap and sealed in an individual bag .
neutral	i hope the staff at bcs will now use this method for packing other liquids such as syrup to prevent this happening again .
neutral	this is my second order that has resulted_in a broken box and my order being delivered in post bags .
neutral	stronger boxes needed too please !
neutral	this site is ok for booking_hostels .
neutral	hostelbookers is better because you can leave longer feedback on a place and the feedback is sorted into positives and negatives .
neutral	the feedback on this site is just generic one category .
neutral	also , it '_s annoying when you search a date because they show you all the places with partial availability .
neutral	why would i care about that ?
neutral	i want to know what has full availability for my dates .
neutral	so , you have to use it sometimes because not every hostel advertises on hostelbookers .
neutral	so sometimes hostelworld is a necessary tool , but the booking_fees and limited feedback allowed are lame .
neutral	flowers were delivered on time and were greatly_appreciated .
neutral	however the flower box was slightly_dented and three roses were damaged
neutral	beautiful flowers and perfect delivery , just very poor value for money .
neutral	when i arrived at my mother '_s house and she was arranging them in a vase i asked her where the rest were but no , that was it , 0 small bunches .
neutral	when i paid an extra £_00 for a ' grandissimo ' bunch of flowers , i expect just that .
neutral	i was very very disappointed at the amount of flowers no matter_how pretty they are .
neutral	i shall stick with the local_florist in future i '_m afraid .
neutral	good quality cabinet , delivery service excellent .
neutral	when giving my email address i specifically_asked it not to be used for marketing purposes .
neutral	the very next_day i got the first of many promotional emails not happy
neutral	my wee_boy wanted some xbox_live points and were meant to receive them within an_hour .
neutral	actually received them almost 00_hours_later .
neutral	a good price though .
neutral	i booked a flight through ebookers , unfortunately had to cancel within 00hr .
neutral	period .
neutral	ebookers told me i had to contact the airline_directly .. once i finally got through to the airline , i was told i could only cancel through my booking agent , who was ebookers .
neutral	all in all a very frustrating experience .
neutral	i would certainly not consider booking through ebookers again .
neutral	i ordered these flowers for my sister and brother in law '_s ruby_wedding .
neutral	i ordered them to be there before my arrival at their house .
neutral	yes they were delivered at the right time with no message from whom they had come .
neutral	i did leave a message but i think it went on a second email not the first but it was acknowledged .
neutral	the flowers , in a rather poor quality basket looked insignificant in their setting .
neutral	they did improve slighty but i had imagined a rather larger array .
neutral	i am unsure_whether to use you again or go to that popular chain store '_s site .
neutral	frances rodda
neutral	the items arrived in promised time and acceptable condition .
neutral	however , there are no previews on save the date or thank_you cards .
neutral	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn_'_t type the special character in the middle of my name .
neutral	and without preview we didn_'_t find this out until we received our order , so we had to manually correct on each card as it was too late to order new cards .
neutral	i think , the website should have a preview on everything considering the amount each customers spends .
neutral	also , from the website it wasn_'_t clear , that there will be no difference_between the thank_you and save the date cards .
neutral	as the evening invitation had evening invitation on the front , we wanted to use save the date cards to invite guests to our afternoon drinks reception celebrating our_wedding abroad .
neutral	but as the save the date '_s were the same as thank_you '_s we had add decorations to make them presentable .
neutral	so overall we were disappointed with the order .
neutral	we ordered our_wedding_invitation form here previously and they were lovely , so i guess we had higher expectations
neutral	had to chase_up the courier via head_office as he had not arrived in the allotted_time .
neutral	was passed through to 0 different_departments before speaking to the right one .
neutral	it took over 00_minutes on the phone to tell me that the courier would be an_hour late .
neutral	very frustrating
neutral	internet slow and not always covered , not best network_coverage neither even_tho they marget with t mobile
neutral	although the costumes are good i do feel they are overpriced for what you get in them me and my partner spent a lot of money on 0 costumes and some of the descriptions do not fully include what you do and don_'_t get , considering my mum sent £_00 on her costume and it included more than what we got in a single costume on the website and we requested that they be signed for due to amount we spent but they never were they were just left on our porch , i don_'_t know that i would shop there again .
neutral	i would say the accessories are better then the outfits .
neutral	i already have roller_blinds but thought i would order on the internet , the cord for pulling the blind up and down is very poor quality and i don_'_t see it lasting for a very long time .
neutral	the material of the blind is ok but the measurement of the material was one and half inches shorter that i had anticipated , a good job i was fitting the blind on the outer part of the window and had allowed a little_bit extra , otherwise it would have been too small .
neutral	i suppose you get what you pay for , i won_'_t be ordering on - line again .
neutral	i was pleased with the service but a little disappointed the size of the product was not what i expected
neutral	flowers in good condition but rather a lot of cheap carnations which had a bud which was hanging off broken .
neutral	the vase supplied had hardly_any water and the water that was there was old and had bits of foliage floating in it .
neutral	.
neutral	also ugly sticky_labels had been left on the bottom of the vase so had to immediately change the water and clean vase inside and out .
neutral	i ordered last monday thought i should have it at_least thursday or friday dissapointed at how long it takes to recieve
neutral	i order food for my friend online as she hasn_'_t got a computer .
neutral	both_times i ordered 0 . 0 kilo sensitive dog_food she has had 0 for a dog and one for a cat .
neutral	my experiences have all been good , however , and apart_from the delivery man being unable to read my number on the door , all good .
neutral	bought a pair of converse off the site for my friends christmas , the ordering process was quick and easy and the delivery was quick too .
neutral	when i received the shoes my friend tried them on to make_sure they fitted and we quickly realised i '_d been sent 0 different sized shoes !
neutral	i ordered a size 0 and the converse i received had one size 0 and one size 0 in the box .
neutral	i emailed them about this straight_away and they told me they couldn_'_t give me another pair as they were now out of stock ( nightmare 0_weeks before christmas !).
neutral	they apologised and told me to return them for a full_refund and they gave_me a 00_%_off voucher to make up for it .
neutral	i sent the shoes back on friday and received an_email today ( monday ) saying they '_ve processed my refund and it '_ll be in my account within a few_days .
neutral	bad_experience but it was dealt_with quickly and nicely so i '_m placing a new order tomorrow with my discount_code and hoping there '_s no_issues at all this time !
neutral	we had one local firm from our comparemymove request arrange an_appointment but was disappointed to see that the bigger ( better insured ) firms don_'_t appear to be listed .
neutral	we also had one on - line quote which is next to useless but no - one else seemed to bother .
neutral	we '_ve arranged our own quotes now thanks so whilst this was not_necessarily a complete_waste of time , nothing came of it .
neutral	having ordered the flowers several days in_advance , i was disappointed to discover the flowers for my 00 year_old aunt were not delivered until late_afternoon .
neutral	this meant she went all day thinking we had forgotten her_birthday - sad for an old lady .
neutral	it was only on ringing her at 0 . 00pm that i discovered she hadn_'_t received her flowers yet .
neutral	this made me feel bad for her , as next year she may not be with us .
neutral	i enjoy the breakfasts very much & the snacks are quite good - i like the pop - corn .
neutral	but the lunch / evening meals are a bit so - so .
neutral	they are a bit small , quite tasty but leaving an after - taste which isnt so good , it hangs on ...... & despite adding veg and fruit which i eat anyway it leaves me feeling hungry .... very hungry .
neutral	so hungry i eat even more fruit ( quite a lot ) than the book suggests .
neutral	i lost_0lb the first week but since then i couldnt bear going to the fridge & having the meals staring back at me .
neutral	i tried to cancel by email but it wouldnt go so i phoned up & spoke to a very nice lady ( who speaks with an accent just like my husband - scottish ).
neutral	they accepted my cancellation & organised the collection of what i cant eat for the next_day with a refund .
neutral	so all in all its good service but the dinners are a bit of a no - no .

neutral	our driver was smartly_dressed and the journey itself was very comfotable , but we weren_'_t hapaay with the driver at all .
neutral	i had 00 year_old mother and her elderly frined with me and we had 0 suitcase and 0 big bags but he didn_'_t even offer to carry one bag .
neutral	when we got to pay machine , he said " wait here , i have to pay " the way he said was rather rude .
neutral	when we were coming towards to my house , i told him to turn left at the next corner , because i knew it was a short cut , he just ignored that .
neutral	when we arrived , he opened his boot , but my mother and her friend had to take their bags by themselves , he wasn_'_t even going out from his car , i didn_'_t say anything to him except thank_you , but now i wish i had said somthing to him about his rude , unkind and unfriendly attitude .
neutral	the flowers came on time , i expected more of a fuller bunch but you can '_t expect much at such low_prices
neutral	after we arrived at the meeting_point we were told the wait would be 00_minutes but it was over 0 0 / 0 hours - too long when you still have an_hour and a half to go after that .
neutral	the return was booked in too early , i noticed an_error in the departure time .
neutral	we could have had another 0 0 / 0 hours at resort .
neutral	contact was impossible , the website from the spanish end was difficult so couldn_'_t change it or phone any one .
neutral	as i could not find the pickup dept , i called customer_services , who were helpful but directed me incorrectly the 0st time .
neutral	when i called back , i was a long time on the line , helpful again , but costly phonecall .
neutral	would have been better to have delivered ,
neutral	i had to wait one week for delivery and therefore i did not have my contacts for my christmas party , bummer ;-(
neutral	there was no guidance on how to use the programme or what the buttons did .
neutral	it cropped pictures in a strange way i . e cut people s heads off or cropped in picture in the wrong shape .
neutral	but after_spending a few hours i sorted it out .
neutral	the end_result was great
neutral	the flowers and everything else arrived ok but the balloon was slit up .
neutral	not sure why .
neutral	and the free chocolate was not included in the delivery !
neutral	the table arrived promptly however we are yet unable to build it as clear_instructions were not included .
neutral	please could you send out an instruction_sheet .
neutral	my friend receivwd the flowers however the address said 00 not 00 so presumably delivery person had to ask around ....
neutral	easy to order online although missed the delivery and and to go to fareham to collect order , which was very annoying especialy as the only card i recieved was on city links second_attempt to deliver .
neutral	they should have delivered a card on the first_attempt too .
neutral	ordered mattress on a tuesday , delivery was promised for the wednesday ~ unfortunately believed this and took the old mattress to the tip , silly me .
neutral	received the delivery at lunchtime on the friday as apparantly the courier had taken it to the wrong city !
neutral	will obviously never be so trusting again .
neutral	i paid for express delivery so that my goods would arrive within 0 / 0_days .. it took 0_days for my item to be delivered .
neutral	previously when i have not paid for my express delivery and just checked standard delivery it has arrived quicker_than the express delivery , therefore i would appreciate a refund on my delivery charge .
neutral	many_thanks .
neutral	my order reference was :_0000000
neutral	waited over two_weeks for my order .
neutral	apparently first package was lost in the post .
neutral	customer service quick to respond .
neutral	sent out asap and received shortly_after .
neutral	item good quality - felt customer service could have been a bit more sincere though ( got the feeling that she thought i hadn_'_t ' to given full address ).
neutral	other than that , ok .
neutral	lenses become dry at the end of a day
neutral	i ordered a few plates , napkins , bowls and hats for the jubilee_weekend and they came in a massive box which was full of a black bin_bags worth of packing i understand that things need to arrive in good condition but this was over the top .
neutral	after the recommendation from a friend i was very happy to purchase through blinds0go , however came unstuck once the instructions came out .
neutral	certainly took longer_than the 0 minutes or so that was suggested it would take & found it quite tricky to install .
neutral	it required another person to hold in place whilst attaching to the velux_window frame .
neutral	now they ' re up i am really pleased with them , however would think_twice regarding buying from this company again .
neutral	i live in balsall common , near coventry , and on tuesday_morning , having chosen you from your website , i ordered a bouquet to be sent to my seriously_ill friend in blackburn , requesting same delivery .
neutral	here we are on friday_evening and i had had no acknowledgment from my friend or her family that flowers had been received .
neutral	i was reluctant and embarrassed to phone her , because it sounded as if i was asking to be thanked , but a few_minutes ago i did .
neutral	i learned that the label with the bouquet gave only my christian_name as the sender .
neutral	they have 0 friends with my name , so she and her family tried a number of times to find out from you who the sender was .
neutral	they did not want to try all of us with the same name and embarrass those who had not thought to send flowers .
neutral	apparently you would not reveal the full name of the sender because of confidentiality regulations !
neutral	that astonishes me !
neutral	i fully expected my full name to appear on a delivery note , or similar , along with my brief message .
neutral	so they were embarrassed , i was ditto , and none of us appreciated your efforts at making a same day delivery .
neutral	they tell me this evening that the flowers are truly beautiful , for which i thank_you , but unfortunately the surprise and delight was spoiled .
neutral	i had ordered 0 external coach lights for the garage and we were so pleased with them we ordered another 0 to go around our property .
neutral	we ordered on a friday and paid the extra for next_day delivery however on the monday i still had not received them and called litecraft to find out where they were .
neutral	i was then advised that they were due to be delivered the next_day tuesday .
neutral	i have since emailed litecraft and had a refund of the cost of delivery .
neutral	this was the first time we '_d used meet and greet .
neutral	the person we got through to on the phone wasn_'_t particulaly friendly and sounded rushed .
neutral	we waited nearly 0 mins for them to arrive ( having called 00mins before arriving ) they were scruffy and disinterested .
neutral	on our return we waited 00_mins in the rain ( again , having called 00_mins beforehand ).
neutral	the driver handed me my keys and disapeared without saying a word !
neutral	odd !
neutral	appart from the wait it was all ok i suppose for the price !
neutral	might try a different company next time , this lot were only a couple of £ cheaper_than some others !
neutral	very happy with mazuma when i trade my phone in .
neutral	only issue i have was the packing instructions said i could send my phone by signed delivery for 0 . 00 by royal_mail to ensure it was insured .
neutral	however when i took my home to post_office they informed me this information was incorrect and i had to pay 0 . 00 to ensure my 00 . 00 mobile would be insured .
neutral	disappointing in that way but otherwise can '_t fault the service i received .
neutral	thankyou
neutral	the rental was the cheapest we could find but the car was not as agreed , we were promised a car similar to a c0 and got a car not really suitable for a family of 0 holidaying for two_weeks .
neutral	we had to put our childs buggie on the floor in the back seat leaving no leg_room for our other two children .
neutral	there was no child lock in back doors and the windows were electric so our three year_old kept putting them up and down while we were driving which was very dangerous !
neutral	the childs seat we were given was dirty and very difficult to fit correctly to the seat .
neutral	i have to be honest .
neutral	i looked on the net and they all look so lovely .
neutral	i '_ve never had glasses before so was new at everything .
neutral	however , the glasses came , prescription is all good and they fit lovely .
neutral	only i didn_'_t realise how cheep the frames actually are , they ' re not going to last me long looking at them .
neutral	i spent £_00 on two_pairs of glasses .
neutral	i wish i had gone to boots or something where you can get 0 real quality designer_glasses for £_00 , ones that will last a couple of years .
neutral	putting this all aside , glasses_direct keep you informed on everything , and the glasses come in a week .
neutral	so was happy with this .
neutral	i recently used them , and didn_'_t have any_problems at all .
neutral	i was put off contacting them via the phone with a question that i had , so just went with the flow .
neutral	the tickets were spot_on , the email_confirmations were great and everything worked smoothly and fine .
neutral	the flights were so much_cheaper_than the airline , and got myself a good bargain with no_complaints .
neutral	shame about delivery , ok so i didn_'_t pay as i opted for the free service , but if i knew it would have taken over a week to receive the parcel i would have defiantly paid for postage .
neutral	also not being_able to track your parcel isn_'_t great either !
neutral	other than that goods was dispatched that day and its great value for money !
neutral	!
neutral	i purchased some remanufactured ink_cartridges , big mistake , had to send them all back ( freepost_address so no cost to return the faulty cartriges ) was given a credit_note but i wanted a refund , when i phoned customer_services they said the refund could take up to 00 days , even_though i paid by paypal so refunds should be automatic , it shouldn_'_t take so long to long to do a simple refund .
neutral	customer service agent sounded really bored .
neutral	they have good prices but their customer_services could improve
neutral	the delivery wasnt quite what i expected for the amount that was payed .
neutral	and customer_services were not helpful .
neutral	the actual flowers are beautiful and really look the part , however i would not use this company again .
neutral	i have no comments to add about the product on account of the fact that i haven_'_t received it yet !
neutral	city_link attempted to deliver it twice and on both_occasions i was at work .
neutral	i do not have the sort of job where i can take time off for deliveries and i found the city_link website and phone number extremely unhelpful .
neutral	i was unable to speak directly to actual person to explain that rescheduling the delivery is pointless unless i can speak to the delivery driver about times .
neutral	i now have to go to the depot to pick_up my purchase , which is much more inconvenient and expensive than it would have been to have simply gone out and bought the product from the shop !
neutral	really enjoyed making up photograph albumn , but when trying to choose a background for a golden_wedding_anniversary albumn felt choice limited .
neutral	other component that proved to finally be difficult was that photographs on my computer_screen appeared satisfactorily exposed , however 0 important photographs in the albumn turned_out dull .
neutral	i think that when you register a company with your website it states that all company '_s will be registered in 0 hours , however we have registered over 0 companies with you and we have waited a lot longer_than 0 hours .
neutral	i had ordered a table arrangements hoping to cheer_up my daughter after losing her_beloved_dog .
neutral	the flowers arrived on the next_day but unfortunately she was disappointed in the arrangement .
neutral	too white and roses not very exciting looking .
neutral	might have been better instead of in basket in a vase .
neutral	most_likely i will not order from eflorist again .
neutral	regards
neutral	elli gill
neutral	i liked the flowers very much but not worth £_00 , which was meant to be deluxe , the service was very quick which i was very great full for as i left my order to the last min ,
neutral	postage_costs to ni expensive compared to other_companies
neutral	i '_ve been with simply_suppliments for last 0 years but never got any discount on suppliments or once i had a problem but they didn_'_t sort it out so i had no good experience & customer service with simply_suppliments
neutral	hi
neutral	i '_ve had 0 000 orders now and product wise no_probs .
neutral	however my most_recent_purchase took a long time for delivery .
neutral	when i chased i was told there was a problem with the delivery - i '_d chosen beech wood and they only had pine ( or something_similar ).
neutral	i told them this was no problem , just fit the pine .
neutral	it would have been nice if 000 had been proactive and contacted me , rather_than me chasing a late delivery .
neutral	i generally use quidco for insurance_purposes and have received small_amounts of cash_back .
neutral	last_year i spotted an insurance deal with sainsburys that sounded too good to be true - house and contents for under_£_000 and cash_back of £_00 !!
neutral	i signed_up in november .
neutral	no cash_back by january .
neutral	then saw small_print hidden away on site that sainsburys take up to 0_months to pay .
neutral	rang sainsburys - they said it was a problem with quidco .
neutral	emailed quidco and was promised payment on january 00th .
neutral	no show .
neutral	months followed with emails and posts on fb etc .
neutral	finally paid in may .
neutral	i think quidco offers great value but keep an eye on when cash_back is paid as my amounts dropped_off my account in feb and i may not have received my money if i wasn_'_t prepared to ask for it !
neutral	i will_continue to use the site but will check my account carefully
neutral	salesman quoted us a price for the vehicle which was £ 0000 more than the vehicle was advertised for on the internet , i didn_'_t realise this until i went home and did an internet_search for the vehicle to compare_prices .
neutral	i had been told the vehicle was located in a holding centre and the salesman would have to arrange to have the vehicle brought to burnley .
neutral	the vehicle was in fact located at the preston dealership with the price displayed in the windscreen .
neutral	we viewed the vehicle at burnley , agreed to buy it , paid in full , including road_tax .
neutral	i arranged for insurance to be faxed directly to burnley so vehicle could be taxed .
neutral	when we went to collect the vehicle it had not been taxed !
neutral	a plastic cover from the door_handle had not been replaced and there was no fuel in the vehicle .
neutral	we are still_waiting for the spare set of keys .
neutral	the ordering process has always been good but this is the second time that i have had problems with their delivery company - parcelforce .
neutral	whilst i appreciate it is not petplanets fault that parcelforce find it incredibly difficult to delivery my order on time , i would expect a good level of customer service and for them to chase it up , after all the delivery company they use can make or break a supplier .
neutral	i contacted petplanet after my order which should have been received on next_day delivery had not arrived and was told my a rather apathetic individual that there had been delays in getting it to the main hub .
neutral	i explained i had paid the next_day delivery fee to which i was told " yes i will refund it ", when i don_'_t know .
neutral	i was assured it would definitely arrive the following_day without even checking with the parcelforce .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will be using this company again , which is a shame as they are the only stockists of a particular food i need for my dog , but they don_'_t seem very bothered when the delivery aspect goes_wrong and as this is the second time now i am somewhat fed_up with it .
neutral	i still don_'_t know when the parcel will arrive but not worth contacting them again about it as i will only be told it will be with me tomorrow !
neutral	bought new gold ghd_styler , took 0_days for delivery , then when finally received don_'_t think ghds as good as they used to be .
neutral	bought these as replacement when old ghds broke .
neutral	will give a cheaper brand a try next time i need new straighteners .
neutral	whilst the taps arrived on time and clearly seemed to be in very good working order , when my builder tried to install them there was a slight fault inside one of the taps meaning that they had to fix it .
neutral	wasn_'_t worth sending it back to be replaced but would have hoped for better .
neutral	delivery takes_longer_than when i first started ordering from petsupermarket 0 years_ago so have to order well in_advance so that i don_'_t run_out of dog_food
neutral	was delivered in a timely_manner although i '_m almost certain i paid for my purchase to be gift_wrapped and it wasn_'_t ..
neutral	although order processed was surprised by lack of response , had to ring about three_times to find out when my order was going to be sent , did expect in this day and age at_least an_email to keep me informed of the situation , did not mind the delay in receiving plants but hate having to chase .
neutral	i dont_know_whats happened since google has_been upgraded , its sooo slow , when your typing in a search it takes_forever to catch up with what your typing , and image and shopping results are all scrambled up , loved my google_search before the upgrade , really dont like it now
neutral	i found ordering samples very quick and easy although one sample i requested never arrived .
neutral	the ordering process was pretty straight_forward but when i did have a question before i ordered i sent an_email and had a quick reply .
neutral	i know on the website it fully makes you aware that some invitations you need to make up yourself but when my invitations did arrive i had to tie my own bows , with me not been very good at this i felt the invitation didn_'_t quite look as nice , so would have much preferred for them to be done for me even if it was an extra_cost .
neutral	no issue with the product , recipient happy and would buy again .
neutral	paid for packing and was disappointed with how shoddy it was on this occassion - acknowledge that if done well and properly , would be quite nice .
neutral	contacted them and trying to get a result seems unduly long , if you are buying a rpesent most people don_'_t do it it several weeks in_advance so don_'_t have vast quantities of leeway for chasing back and forwards on the subject .
neutral	so on the attention to detail side - i am not personally a fan but product quite satisfactory .
neutral	at the end of the day it is down to each_individual '_s experience .
neutral	really happy with my purchase from boohoo its a lovely dress .
neutral	however , i paid for saturday delivery and the delivery service parcelforce did not even attempt to call me or ring my door_bell .
neutral	as i live in an apartment_block , i had no idea of how i was supposed to know they were delivering my parcel and needed me to sign for it .
neutral	after_contacting customer_services they refunded my postage but " politely informed me that this is a one off and they don_'_t usually do this " i would suggest hiring better delivery people as it is common courtesy to ring the doorbell on arrival at someones property .
neutral	despite the shoes being identical to my normal practice pair , the strap wasn_'_t long enough for the buckle to reach .
neutral	i ended_up having to take them into the shop in buckhurst hill for them to punch new holes at the end , in order for them to fit .
neutral	service was good .
neutral	flowers arrived as ordered .
neutral	however my daughter has had to throw half of them out within a few_days .
neutral	i thought fresh flowers should have lasted_longer
neutral	we always use the long_stay parking at the airport and never had any_problems until this booking because we bought the cheap deal no amendments allowed unfortunately i put in the wrong return date as it was after midnight when we would be out of the airport there was no way to amend the date within the site straight after you have paid i understand the rules of no cancellations / refunds but i wanted to correct an_error and though the staff were polite when i explained what i had done they could not help not good customer service from the management side in saying that i have booked them for our further trips away this year as it is handy and i double_check the dates
neutral	sorry tesco , but your web_site needs refining .
neutral	i have given up trying to buy from you on line as the site doesn_'_t seem to like me and won_'_t let_me back when i click for more information on an item .
neutral	i have no such problem with sainsbury and ocado .
neutral	although very easy to order and super quick delivery - we were extremely unhappy with delivery service and some aspects of the order .
neutral	this was the fact that we had two skrews only for the two blinds we ordered - so missing skrews .
neutral	instructions inside very poor and had to watch video and even then was difficult to quite see where parts fitted .
neutral	the most disappointing part was that the delivery - we arrived home to find a scrawled message on a scrappy piece of paper pushed through letterbox simply saying ' in garden '.
neutral	we looked in our back garden and found the blind simply on the floor over the fence - it had been raining that day so the box was soaking_wet - the fence is quite high so it had obviously just been thrown over the fence - fortunately as the blind was small they were undamaged although a bit wet .
neutral	the blinds were absolutely fine for the job they were bought for and i would have no_hesitation in recommending the blind as ' value for money ' and people always tend to have a few spare skrews around in their garage .
neutral	i was impressed by the speed at which my order for some braces arrived but i am disappointed that there is a big mark on one of the front clips .
neutral	no time to return it as i wish to give it as a present now .
neutral	the price is good .
neutral	however , as far as i could see they did not tell you before paying that you would need to provide evidence to show you are not a fraud .
neutral	what if i had not had such evidence , and yet still would have paid nonetheless ?
neutral	for some reason after a while they seemed to change their mind and send me the code anyway ... am i no_longer suspicious then ?
neutral	i understand the need to dig_out frauds , but needing to provide evidence after purchase is ridiculous and needs to be made more clear .
neutral	to end on a positive however , the code did arrive quickly once the former was sorted .
neutral	great ordering experience , brilliant delivery ( came by interlink courier who give a one hour delivery slot and stick to it ) but disappointed when opened package .
neutral	i ordered three sizes of bags and expected there to be three packets within the package ..... no , there were just loose carrier_bags , some of which were stuck together and the handles came off when we tried to separate them .
neutral	will probably go elsewhere for our next order .
neutral	i purchased some flowers for a relative but unfortunately the petals started dropping after 0 day which is a shame :-(
neutral	the order was delivered as requested but why so late ?
neutral	flowers as a birthday treat should be enjoyed throughout the day .
neutral	i '_m a little disappointed !
neutral	the flowers were delivered on the correct day , one bunch was requested after 0pm but was delivered earlier so surprise was ruined .
neutral	both bunches i ordered the colour delivered were very different .
neutral	i chose subtle colours to match houses and had bright flowers sent .
neutral	the flowers were lovely but now do not match
neutral	i recently placed an order online and had a query with the promotional_code that did not appear to have been applied .
neutral	to date i have still not had an acknowledgement of the email or a responce .
neutral	apart_from that i have always loved the oka range .
neutral	0 roses - 0 was completely wilted .
neutral	0 lilies - 0 was broken off .
neutral	arrived in large box and expected them to be intact .
neutral	disappointed the item i really wanted wasn_'_t in stock ( despite plenty of stock showing online ), particularly as this was my first order .
neutral	but i have not received 0 items on my shopping list .
neutral	was promised on another delivery to follow .
neutral	it is two_weeks_later i am still_waiting :(
neutral	software is really frustrating compare to others .
neutral	delivery and the album were ok .
neutral	although due to the software it took a lot longer and much more effort than_anticipated .
neutral	original order no .
neutral	000000 - second delivery 000000
neutral	i placed an order for delivery of flowers to my sister in preston , lancs , on 00 feb . 0000 .
neutral	the order was for 00 tulips , plus vase .
neutral	when i had finished completing order i pressed the button and the order appeared to go through twice .
neutral	i had two messages on my cellphone to confirm order and two messages on the email .
neutral	i rang my credit_card company and asked that the second amount be cancelled , but was advised it could only be cancelled by the company with whom the order had been placed .
neutral	i wrongly presumed it would be realised that this was a duplicate order .
neutral	the original order was sent to my sister on 00 feb . - it was as requested , although there were only 00 flowers , but there was greenery and it was beautifully_arranged ( her comments ).
neutral	they also delivered it to her home address as it was too late for delivery to the work address given .
neutral	today , 00nd february , she received another delivery of tulips from some florist in padiham , address given as 0 ribble court ,
neutral	padiham , via_dhl - 00 stems , no greenery and a cheap and nasty looking vase .
neutral	why did the second delivery come from padiham ( miles from preston ) on the wrong day and the wrong order .
neutral	some explanation would be appreciated
neutral	information on web_site was helpful and ordering process straight_forward .
neutral	it would have been helpful if the despatch of the order could have been notified by email , as it was not possible to arrange to be at home for the package to be received , or to organise installation .
neutral	the taps have been in use for too short a time to give a definite view but , so far , they look better_than_expected and work very well
neutral	although the price of the rangemaster and hood were excellent i was not happy with the cost of the 0 man delivery .
neutral	basically whether you are spending over_£ 0 , 000 . 00 or just £_000 . 00 with cookersandovens , cookersandovens charge the same for 0 man delivery , in total £_00 . 00 !
neutral	most online purchases have a structured delivery charge dependent on how much you are spending with the company - spend less , pay more delivery , which is acceptable and fair .
neutral	i would also appreciate that should a company be delivering to a top floor_flat then the delivery charge would be more .
neutral	i would recommend cookersandovens but i would also recommend people search the internet for a better deal as my purchase from cookersandovens was due to wanting a specific oven that most others suppliers did not stock .
neutral	paula williams , cheltenham .
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong , i love amazon .
neutral	but they don_'_t have any customer service .
neutral	none .
neutral	how do you even get in touch with them ?
neutral	!
neutral	i used to be a fan of ebay , but not anymore . ebay charges you , paypal charges for the same transaction and there is not even an option to pay by check or money order . additionally , i think there are too many cheap and bad quality products from professional sellers that just destroy the whole idea of ebay .
neutral	i purchased a photo_cushion as a gift it was sent directly to the recipient .
neutral	i would never of paid full price for this item ( i got it through a deal ) as the material is cheap feeling but the picture quality was good .
neutral	we booked flights from luton to tenerife with monarch .
neutral	the cost for 0 adults ( after adding all the taxes which get added to the basic price ) was £_000 . 00 each .
neutral	then there was a charge of £_00 . 00 for paying by credit_card .
neutral	then you have to pay £_00 . 00 each way for each bag you want to go in the hold .
neutral	the website says you are allowed 0k each for hand - luggage , which is barely enough for a laptop + case - although in fact at both airports our hand_luggage was not weighed .
neutral	if you want to check in on - line so you can reserve your seats it costs ( i think ) £ 0 . 00 per_person each way .
neutral	you also have to pay ( around £ 0 i think ) if you want a meal during the flight .
neutral	and of course you can pay for extra leg - room .
neutral	after all these extras you may well think that this is not such a budget_airline after all .
neutral	and the stress of worrying_about having hand - luggage weighed can be considerable .
neutral	the check - in at both_ends was painless .
neutral	the plane itself is of course very basic , and leg - room is a joke - i '_m just over 0ft_tall and even i found it a squash .
neutral	interestingly , if you look at the overhead lights , you can see that they do not match up with the seats - it '_s obvious that the original seats have been removed and extra rows put in .
neutral	on board they will charge you for everything .
neutral	you even have to pay if you want a blanket !
neutral	as i was paying for 0 seats , it was worth choosing a budget_airline , but if it was just the two of us , i would prefer to pay a bit more for a bit more comfort and less stress .
neutral	i ordered a personalised , miniature bottle of whisky and paid_extra for the box .
neutral	it was a nice gift and arrived in good condition .
neutral	however , delivery took a long time .
neutral	it was sent first_class by royal_mail but it took 0_days to be delivered after i received the e_- mail_stating it had been dispatched .
neutral	my mother ordered me a ted_baker ladies watch a couple of week_ago .
neutral	we have it the 00 working_days delivery estimate but it has still not arrived !
neutral	we have emailed wowcher twice but still no response !!
neutral	!
neutral	easy to use and delivery quick .
neutral	products just right
neutral	i signed_up to quidco a few_months_ago , and i am generally pleased .
neutral	but , why is there no general ' contact us ' feature ?
neutral	my clicksnap thing refuses to work as it states i have the wrong log in details .
neutral	i tried to contact quidco , and found i could only view some useless faq_section which does not allow you to send them a message .
neutral	the mobile checkins are great as these are not included in the retention_fee , but sometimes the app has problems and you cannot check in .
neutral	on the whole , i like this company and all of my transactions with them have gone_smoothly .
neutral	delivery and dispatch are usually quite quick , and they often have huge discount days .
neutral	the problem with this site , is firstly , the swatches of the products .
neutral	it is impossible to tell what shade you are in their foundations , and even some of the nail_polish swatches are completely_untrue to real_life .
neutral	secondly , the quality of the products varies so much !
neutral	you can buy a product , love it , then repurchase it and it will be horrible !
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why they don_'_t have better quality control .
neutral	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
neutral	i bought a lipgloss from their mineral range and the packaging is so bad you can barely get any out of the tube !
neutral	not sure if i would buy anything again .
neutral	service was very good with speed and good packaging on item .
neutral	however only 0_stars as quality of item was very poor and inferior .
neutral	don_'_t think it will last long .
neutral	have bought much_cheaper covers before that have been far_superior .
neutral	despatched and delivered very quickly thank_you .
neutral	however , even_though i measured the length of the arm from elbow to middle of the little finger and ordered the correct sling , it is far too small .
neutral	his wrist is flopping out of the sling , even_though the elbow is snug to the other end of the sling .
neutral	i guess the larger_size though would be too long on the straps .
neutral	teenage_boys are long on the arms but still have small chest size - maybe you could do a youth size ?
neutral	just some feedback
neutral	kd regards
neutral	i have designed and purchased a large_amount of books from photoworld and have been really happy with the result of the product through the door , my only_complaint is that i had a code which gave_me free_postage when i tried to use it , is said it had already been used ?
neutral	i definitely had not , i spent over_£_00 and it said free post .
neutral	i have not had chance to get in contact with them so it has not yet been resolved but next week when i have some spare time i will get in contact and see if i can get my postage money back ?
neutral	ordered a dakine roller bag - brilliant product and price , and my son is very happy with it .
neutral	however , when ordering i paid for next_day delivery , and waited in ( all day friday ).
neutral	at one point i thought i would see whether i could contact the courier to establish exact delivery time , was given a tracking_number by extreme_pie , and the courier '_s website , only to find that delivery was scheduled for monday .
neutral	very annoyed .
neutral	contacted extreme_pie by phone who told me that my postcode is classed_as " highlands " ( which we are most certainly not , but this is not the first time this has happened with on - line deliveries .)
neutral	this was not clear on the website .
neutral	i was promptly e_- mailed confirmation that my delivery charge would be waived , but it would have been nice , and much_better pr , to have had some communication confirming that for future " highland " customers this will be made clear on the website at the point where the delivery option is made .
neutral	booking my parcel was easy and problem free , i was also very happy with the price and how quickly it stated my parcel would be delivered .
neutral	collection of the parcel was also easy and efficient , the driver was on time and was friendly .
neutral	however , my parcel was promised to be delivered 0 working_days_later and i was yet to receive it 0 day later .
neutral	this is a bit of a nuisance considering i had to spend both days at home between_0am and 0pm to receive the parcel .
neutral	i '_m therefore saying that the delivery times aren_'_t very accurate .
neutral	however up until this point i was very pleased with their service .
neutral	has let_me down in the past but is a fast , easy payment_method .
neutral	a good product but arrived with the bag open - clearly recycled so i couldn_'_t do the heat moulding without making my own pouch - disappointing .
neutral	the items arrived in good time but - when ordering on - line you are given the opportunity to specify how you would like your delivery - eg - leave with neighbor , leave in safe_place etc .
neutral	i specified to leave my parcel by the back door but as this was not on the parcel , the post_office refused to do this and i had to make a 0 mile_round_trip and pay for parking to collect my items .
neutral	if i had known the instructions would not have been clear on my parcel , i would probably not have ordered from you .
neutral	i chose getlenses because i got cash_back from quidco - but it was declined
neutral	having placed the order and followed the due process , i was surprised not to be sent a proof , which is indicated online .
neutral	all that said the goods came early and were fine , i do wonder what would have happened had there been an_error ?
neutral	seems a little silly to publish the process online if you don_'_t follow it ..................... still_waiting for someone to call me back re my telephone query which is now redundant .... ah well poor customer service such as this is normal these days it would seem .
neutral	i am due to go on holiday in july and thought this would be great for some cheap and cheerful clothes , how wrong was i ?
neutral	they have very few select items that are 00plus therefore i now have to go elsewhere and spend extra money al because they don_'_t cater for the bigger lady .
neutral	i had chosen nominated day delivery which_meant that i was in all day on the day that i had chosen .
neutral	however at the end of the day i received an_email_saying my parcel would arrive the next_day .
neutral	lucky for me in this case , i found the delivery guy at my door when i came home the following_day .
neutral	i could have easily missed him if i was a few seconds late which would have been a nightmare !!
neutral	if the service is offered it should be met or else don_'_t offer it in the first place !
neutral	ps happy with the product though
neutral	yea i recommend hellocanvas to my friends .
neutral	quick turn_around service
neutral	website is easy to use but the only issue is that the videos aren_'_t viewable from all countries , meaning i can '_t see videos !
neutral	i was pleased when i saw the flowers i had ordered to be sent to my friend as they were lovely but as i had selected and paid for the large bouquet ( out of small medium or large ) i was rather disappointed in the number of blooms .
neutral	certainly didn_'_t warant being called ' large '.
neutral	glad i didn_'_t order the medium as it would have looked miserly .
neutral	i purchased a bouquet of blue_dendrobium as a 00th_birthday_gift for a friend .
neutral	when i asked about them she was reluctant to say but after some persuasion said they were not that impressive but it was a lovely thought .
neutral	the picture on the web_site was misleading as there was no greenery and the bouquet was sparse . the instructions mentioned gel but there was none .
neutral	she is going to send me a picture which i would be happy to forward in the future .
neutral	i was embarassed and thought that i should share my concerns .
neutral	need to be more cheap
neutral	i can '_t praise serenata highly_enough .
neutral	they never let_me down .
neutral	beautiful flowers every time .
neutral	i '_m really upset for the first time the recipient was disapointed with the flowers she received , apparently in the past the flowers have been ' arranged ' , same order as usual !.
neutral	what happened .
neutral	ann zahl
neutral	the toy place nice and helpful they need to use someone_else for delivery .
neutral	took a full week to arrive a day late for my sons_birthday so was not very happy .
neutral	i have worn size 00 all my life , and ordered size 00 .
neutral	however
neutral	these were not 00 .
neutral	at_least i can get my money back - eventually
neutral	- albeit a rather long process .
neutral	why can '_t return procedure be included in the parcel .
neutral	good service but an overload of emails .
neutral	felt somewhat pressured .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	im happy with this service to a certain degree .
neutral	ive been a customer for a few_months now .
neutral	always pay what i owe .
neutral	but when i asked for an increase in the amount i can borrow i was denied .
neutral	it gave_me an explanation as to the reasons_why the only way to get an increse and i qualify for one
neutral	hmmm , it was rather annoying to discover that there were no instructions on how to use this powder , it only stated what the daily recommended dose was .
neutral	it had no instructions on how to mix or with how much water cold / hot .
neutral	the powder did not dissolve in water and was quite potent as it burns the throat whilst drinking ( actually like drinking glass splinters !!)
neutral	and no .... to be honest no change in first week , all in all ..... pretty poo !!
neutral	however the company itself dispatched item quickly and easily .
neutral	booked the mobile tyre changing service for saturday_morning .
neutral	excellent that it '_s free , it '_s a real godsend if you have things you need to be doing and a toddler to deal with .
neutral	slot is 0 am - 0 pm .
neutral	i had one other thing to do that required a car - pick_up a parcel from the post_office .
neutral	it would take 00_minutes .
neutral	surely , i thought , that wouldn_'_t be a problem .
neutral	confirmation_email said the mobile mechanic would call to update us on arrival time .
neutral	he didn_'_t .
neutral	at 0 . 00 i called the support number and was told that mechanic would be there " within the hour ".
neutral	great , i thought , i '_ll be able to pop to the post_office afterwards .
neutral	nearly and hour and a half later he '_s still not there .
neutral	at 00 . 00 i call .
neutral	they can '_t get_hold of him but are sure he '_s on his way .
neutral	he pulls up 0 minutes later .
neutral	changed the tyres without a hitch , no_complaints at all about his service , but by the time he finished it was too late to go to the post_office for an important parcel .
neutral	if they '_d been more accurate when i first called , or he '_d called to update me at any point , i could have popped out before he arrived .
neutral	surely it would be simple enough to call each customer just before you finish with the previous one to give them a little warning of your arrival ?
neutral	i purchased the miss amazing handbag deal through wowcher at the beginning of february .
neutral	after waiting over 0_weeks for my order i tried to contact miss amazing by email ( no response ) and telephone ( number unobtainable and mailbox full ).
neutral	with alarm_bells ringing i contacted wowcher for assistance and they too contacted miss amazing on my behalf to request they contact me asap .
neutral	after receiving no response i contacted wowcher again only to be advised that miss amazing are no long able to fulfill the deal .
neutral	wowcher have arranged to refund my credit_card with the £_00 i paid for the deal but i have lost out on the £ 0 postage i had to pay to miss amazing to fulfill the order .
neutral	i am unable to claim this amount on my credit_card due to it being less_than £_000 and nochex who processed the payments do not enter into disputes between buyers and sellers .
neutral	over 000 people claimed this deal - that is a lot of £ 0 '_s and i am beginning to wonder_if it was just a big scam .
neutral	not blaming wowcher - they did what they could to rectify matters but they obviously need to scrutinise their merchant partners better to avoid this situation happening again .
neutral	although the flowers themselves were beautiful there were only a few stem which looked meagrely and did not represent the image on the web_page .
neutral	also , inside the birthday card the message had been stuck on which looked very amateur
neutral	we have used nationwide before to lease vans and service has_been great .
neutral	however this time they seemed to be a bit sloppy with getting details to me , i asked if my van was going to be delivered on the date i requested a month previously only to find that they hadn_'_t sent any of the paper_work through .
neutral	then when the van arrived it hadn_'_t been plylined as requested .
neutral	both_times they were quick to offer solutions but not the experience that we had had with them before .
neutral	shame this time but we would use again as the service has_been good in the past .
neutral	the photobook arrived in time and the process was smooth .
neutral	the only let_down was that some pictures were not as clearly printed as i had expected and indeed had had with other printers ( photobox , for example ).
neutral	i renewed my car insurance in january ... just received the cash_back at the end of june ...
neutral	fluff heaven has some good deals on nappies , i bought some wraps which i couldn_'_t get from any other site and needed them asap for my newborn .
neutral	i ordered with express delivery which cost over_£ 0 but my parcel took several days to arrive .
neutral	i complained and was given a refund on my delivery charge which was good .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive any order confirmation or dispatch_note which i didn_'_t like .
neutral	i '_m not sure i '_d shop with fluff heaven again but their offers are very tempting .
neutral	i like beauty_bay and will use again , however it was very unfortunate that the product i purchased was awful for me .
neutral	it was urban_decay pore perfector and having oilyish skin it meant that the this product became like an oily film within a couple of hours .
neutral	absolutely awful , so i used once and at £_00 i was very unhappy .
neutral	prior to ordering , i used the online_chat_facility and the lady i spoke to was extremely_helpful at advising me on the best products to buy for my specific pest problem and taking into account that i have pets and children when selecting a insecticide .
neutral	i placed the order which came promptly but on opening the products for use , i felt very nervous_about their application as the instructions on the products label were not detailed enough .
neutral	i wish they would send an instruction_leaflet with the products , that has important ' need to knows ' such as when it '_s safe to re enter the room after treatment etc .
neutral	the lack of information made me very nervous using the products .
neutral	only time will tell on how effective the products have been .
neutral	only luck would have it someone in , as i had made arrangements to go out , got email to say would be delivered and fortunately my husband was at home sick !
neutral	would they have redelivered ?
neutral	had to be signed for .
neutral	have not had this problem before !
neutral	maybe because bigger delivery .
neutral	it was difficult to find as it did not look like airport_parking .
neutral	when i arrived back after my flight it was dark , the car_park was poorly lit and i was not told where my car was parked .
neutral	when i couldn_'_t find my car the staff then directed me .
neutral	the staff were helpful and the minibus was frequent and quick .
neutral	very good helper .
neutral	finding thinks , pix easily
neutral	very good range of sections and delivery
neutral	i have found excellent bargains on here but ive also been dissappointed with items that appear to be bargfains but are extrosioate in p_&_p . also the packaging that does come tends to be way over sized for the products its carrying so i feel im maybe being charged unessisarily .
neutral	pusts me off and i regularly return to [_external_reference_].
neutral	great and speedy delivery , one item small finger vibrator did not work , enjoyed the experience without the vibration but still think it could of been better with .
neutral	i purchased my products and then a day or 0 later beautybay had a sale on exactly those products so i was a little disappointed .
neutral	i know there is not much beautybay could do about it but exceptional service would be to have known about the sale in_advance .
neutral	not happy with the care taking over my parcel .
neutral	some stuff were broken / damaged .
neutral	the only good thing is the quick delivery .
neutral	got the xbox on time after having to ring tnt as something had gone wrong then to find out it was being sent to the wrong_address as shopto didn_'_t actually give them the delivery address i stated
neutral	i already complained about this in an_email .
neutral	we are frequent travelers from luxbg to the uk and have used the vip service on every trip over the last few_years .
neutral	however , since the new flexi ticket was introduced late last_year , and despite always choosing this option , we were very disappointed to be denied vip on our last return from dover even_though , when we got on board and the purser let us into the lounge , we counted only 00 passengers in there .
neutral	( the lady at check in in dover had said it was full ).
neutral	as we have a 0_hr journey on each side of the channel , the vip option and more recently , the flexi ticket , give us the flexibility in case of traffic problems .
neutral	we were so disappointed about the change in policy that we took p_& 0 last month instead .
neutral	overall a positive_experience but i did pay for express delivery and do not feel that i got it which was a shame .
neutral	poor service in the vip_lounge .
neutral	staff went on break on sailing la vernada bar shut at lunch_time !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a nest of tables from argos about 0_weeks_ago .
neutral	when i ordered i chose the delivery date and although it was about 0_weeks in the future i was happy to wait as the tables looked nice and the price was reasonable .
neutral	the tables arrived on the specified day of delivery so i was happy but on opening the package they looked very different to the picture on the website !
neutral	i was quite shocked as the tables looked to be poor quality and definitely couldn_'_t use them so i contacted customer_services to see what i could do .
neutral	the lady was very helpful and told me that the full_amount would be refunded to my card within 0_days and they would come and pick_up the tables in about 0_weeks .
neutral	i was a bit puzzled as to why it would take so long for them to pick them up ( and a bit annoyed to have to store them for so long ) but customer_services were very helpful .
neutral	i '_ll definitely use argos again but perhaps for a product like this i '_ll use a different company where i can inspect it before i buy .
neutral	excellent customer service but let_down_badly by the courier company they use .
neutral	i have had nothing but trouble from parcels being delivered to the wrong_address , putting a calling_card through letter_box without ringing the bell ( on more than one occassion ) when i am in , to arranging a second delivery and they don_'_t turn_up .
neutral	cannot rely_on getting the medication you need on time but this is not the companies fault , just the courier company they chose to use .
neutral	flowers arrived exactly as ordered , the only_negative_comment i could make was that the roses were past their best .
neutral	they were in full_bloom but unfortunately the edges were already starting to go brown .
neutral	i thought the card with the care instructions was excellent with really good information .
neutral	unfortunately i think the lifespan will not meet expectations .
neutral	always takes_longer_than estimated .
neutral	my mother was shocked at the price !!!
neutral	!
neutral	great price , great blinds and good service the first time i ordered .
neutral	this time though , delivery took 00 days and we were without the blinds after moving in .
neutral	i chased the order and was told there had been a delay in production and nothing could be done .
neutral	i hadn_'_t been informed of the delay .
neutral	i also placed another order for a different property and didn_'_t receive an_email invoice for them .
neutral	i called and was told there was no trace of the order .
neutral	i was about to order again when the blinds arrived !!
neutral	!
neutral	easy to use but the red is overused and not very calming on the eyes .
neutral	many items are often out of stock and finding a store nearby that has all the items you need is often difficult .
neutral	their prices are fairly good however , but i wouldn_'_t recommend getting a huge list of things from there - would be better when buying a singular large item if you want convenience .
neutral	our product has arrived after 0 missed delivery dates , we were advised that they had been let_down by the 0rd_party supplier and their specialist courier but it was eventually delivered by tnt so not sure what happened there .
neutral	haven_'_t opened and checked our goods yet but as they are sealed it would be bad_luck and not service to blame if there is anything missing / broken .
neutral	ps .
neutral	rhian was great !
neutral	firstly can i say the lights , accessories etc .
neutral	are fab , no_problems there , and great quality - we bought more icicle_lights to go with the ones from last_year .
neutral	that '_s where the problems began as it wasn_'_t totally clear that although the large charger takes loads of icicles you can '_t have them on one big chain .
neutral	nor can you buy a t connector to have them running in opposite directions .
neutral	on the large charger you have multiple outlets which each run a maximum of 0 sets i . e you cant go more than 00 mts from the charger - not much use on a 00 mt drive .
neutral	i bought a medium charger this year , thinking it would run 0 sets but it only takes a maximum of 0 , so i had to send the charger back with one set if lights , and use my big charger from last_year for th rest .
neutral	the free gutter hooks were missing but we didnt need them anyway .
neutral	i would absolutely purchase again but clearer instructions or even diagrams as to how you can configure these would be good .
neutral	my order with kitchen_door workshop was not as straight_forward as it could have been and not sure that any of my e : mail feedback is really sinking in with any of the staff that i have spoken with .
neutral	where i cannot_fault the company on the quality of the make of their doors , their packaging , checking of orders before being dispatched and most of all their customer service leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	waiting for 0_days for limited information that i then had to follow_up myself is disgusting and then being told that there was no chance of compensation even from goodwill as the company were fulfilling their order that was incorrect in the first place is trully unbelievable .
neutral	things were sorted in the end however , i did accept damaged goods ( which were eventually refunded ), and only because i was sick of waiting for the replaced items , however the cost of my time calling and my extra workmen costs as the order was incorrect in the first place has rather soured my experience with the company .
neutral	wouldn_'_t process a few things but eventually went through .
neutral	i am always so impressed by chemistdirect '_s prices and their range of products .
neutral	i have sadly now been waiting a week for my order to be delivered , and considering the postage_costs and the nature of the products ( medication ), it '_s not really good enough .
neutral	service delivery & returns great , sizing poor , jeans had thighs too small waist too large on tomboy jeans
neutral	ok service online ( just ), but charged_£ 0 . 00 to deliver some gift_vouchers to my friend for her_birthday who_lives just up the road from longacres , and i thought the royal_mail was getting expensive !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	good selection of named products with excellent prices .
neutral	good options for deliveries .
neutral	product even came with full size complimentary item and also a trial size item which i was not expecting .
neutral	i have dropped two stars because of confusion_over delivery .
neutral	ordered on new years day for next_day delivery .
neutral	following_day an_email informed delivery would be on 0 . 0 . 00 .
neutral	when i rang querying this i was told that items were not posted due to it being a bank_holiday .
neutral	delivery information on website does not state this only items will not be delivered on weekends or bank_holidays .
neutral	a bit misleading so i stated the delivery information should reflect this as some companies still operate on bank_holidays .
neutral	the young_man i spoke to did not really seem interested in this despite him stating he would pass my comments on .
neutral	i was given refund of delivery but ended_up wasting a days leave to be in on both days .
neutral	got what i wanted at a great price on the website .
neutral	the order went through with a 0 day delivery suggested .
neutral	when nothing turned_up after a week i contacted the company who advised that the website had been wrong and the item had been out of stock .
neutral	i should have had an_email or phone_call to advise me of the error .
neutral	whilst i was disappointed my order was handled very well after this point and my item arrived a few_days_later .
neutral	very happy with the whole_experience , good communication , good service , good delivery times .
neutral	i was a little disappointed at the bunch of flowers my mother received for her_birthday .
neutral	many had not opened yet and it lacked the range of colour i expected .
neutral	delivery was fine .
neutral	easy to download the software .
neutral	fairly easy to play around with the layouts etc but took a while to figure things out !
neutral	could be better faqs an help .
neutral	i wasn_'_t clear that my order had gone_through and as no money taken from account i had to call them .
neutral	customer service not brilliant but have now received book and very pleased with end_result .
neutral	ordering , payment , dispatch and speed of delivery was great but unfortunately the no . 0 sparkler i purchased for my twins 0th_birthday arrived damaged .
neutral	i called asking for a replacement on the wednesday and explained that the party was on the friday .
neutral	a replacement was sent out , but only 0st_class recorded so the item arrived on the saturday_afternoon ....
neutral	if it had been sent out ' next_day ' sp delivery , i would have had a lovely no . 0 sparkler on my twins birthday_cake instead of 0 simple coloured candles ... courtesy of the local_garage / co - op !
neutral	the order processing , payment etc was perfect so such a shame that whoever sent out the replacement , did not think or take into account the expected delivery time of standard recorded delivery .
neutral	a waste of mine and their money !
neutral	i found the claves a bit_disappointing - they do not have much of round sound .
neutral	i know that they are not expensive , but still i was expecting a bit more .
neutral	i ordered a total of four photo pillows , the hard bit was finding a photo that was the right size .
neutral	the process should have been easy but i found it confusing and i was unable to find any help .
neutral	tried online_chat and was given an 0 minute response time for my query , over an_hour later i still hadn_'_t had a response and i was number 0 in the queue !
neutral	but , this was redeemed by the pillow itself , although slightly_smaller_than i thought the images on them are very very good and cannot be_faulted .
neutral	this is my 0th blind from 000 and have always been happy , but this blind does not seem to have the same quality as the others .
neutral	not all fixings were included in box , so because it was a bank_holiday we improvised and cut the fixings down .
neutral	then the attachments for the blinds to the hooks are very flimsy and keep falling_off .
neutral	it is a shame because i have been so pleased with the others i have bought .
neutral	would think_twice before ordering again .
neutral	lovely set of professional stainless_steel pots and pans spoiled only by one thing - the incredibly difficult to get off sticky stickers pro - cook mercilessly adhere to the bottom of every pan !!
neutral	was in two_minds whether to ring up and complain and still_haven_'_t - but this review has allowed me to at_least voice an opinion .
neutral	forget sticky_labels procook and you would have got five_stars !!
neutral	!
neutral	i couldn_'_t order online because i have moved since my last order , and couldn_'_t update my address online , but i got a quick email answer with an 0000 phone number to call .
neutral	when i objected on grounds of cost , they emailed a regular number which i used to order my goods .
neutral	good email communication about delays in delivery because of stock issues .
neutral	goods are just what i needed .
neutral	we have had a few pairs across the family now and they are totally lovely .
neutral	however , since last years ' order the adult moccis ' prize has doubled (!!!).
neutral	we paid £_00 . 00 for them now they are £_00 and the children '_s have increased a lot too .
neutral	i cannot quite see what would justify such a price hike as i thought they were already pricey .
neutral	very sadly we will not be ordering another lot this year at such inflated pricing .
neutral	shame that such a lovely company has got greedy .
neutral	last_year i would have given five_stars without_hesitation .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i havent recevied my order is more then week
neutral	the items i ordered ( a bird_feeding station and patio stand for the station ) were for a friend for christmas .
neutral	but only one of the two parts arrived - i phoned up and they were very helpful and said they would phone me back when they had tracked the second part , but they didn_'_t and it hasn_'_t yet arrived - a week after the original designated delivery date .
neutral	great way of recycling your mobile but really frustrating that you have to call an 0000 number to activate your voucher , ( a way of getting more money from you ), they ' re already getting your mobile ... you can '_t do it online which i think is really sneaky and tried_calling an_alternative number using say no to 0000 . com but the number just rang out .
neutral	it doesn_'_t activate it straight_away either and i have to wait_until_0pm tomorrow to use it ... was going to use it today on a shopping trip .
neutral	next time i '_ll try selling it on ebay .... one more positive ... at_least it was freepost ...
neutral	i received the item very quickly - thank_you .
neutral	not tried the product yet so unable to comment on that !
neutral	i bought a cap to send to my cousin , but during the ordering process there was no where i could insert a gift note , even_though the delivery address could be different from the billing_address .
neutral	the following_morning , i phoned the office to ask them to put in a ' gift note ' and i was told it wasn_'_t possible .
neutral	furthermore , i was told the invoice was going to be included in the package with the gift for the recipient to see !
neutral	i asked her if she could change it , but she said it wasn_'_t possible .
neutral	so , i did send the gift , and it was gratefully_received , but it had to go anonymously and without a note .
neutral	this needs to be changed !
neutral	thanks !!
neutral	!
neutral	i had my order delivered through hermes , not a good experience , even_though i did give instructions , the goods were still delivered outside of time frame .
neutral	the courier didnt even apologise , and the response from pet_supermarket was poor !
neutral	bought these for my boyfriend for our holiday .
neutral	look good , fast delivery but he got blisters in between his toes from these flip_flops which were very painful
neutral	give them a try - once they were always the cheapest but sometimes it '_s cheaper on amazon .
neutral	sorry folks it '_s all about the money !
neutral	however , i received no confirmation as stated on the website .
neutral	i had to follow my order up 0_days_later to ensure it had been sent .
neutral	the online help was good and an e_mail confirmation duly_arrived .
neutral	find these pods make the coffee_machine run really slowly , it takes_forever to make a coffee , they also have a grainy residue within the coffee which i have never_experienced before .
neutral	i bought the variety pack but so far have only really enjoyed one of the blends .
neutral	i '_m a bit disappointed as really had high_hopes for these as an_alternative to nespresso .
neutral	with the cheaper guarantee , you are not missing out on savings from going to other stores , and they regularly have ' spend over_£_00 and get £ 0 off your next shop ' when you next spend over_£_00 .
neutral	what i have a problem is the background music , which is modern and at times too loud .
neutral	when i go shopping , i want relaxing music that doesn_'_t make you feel like rushing in and rushing out .
neutral	haven_'_t these people heard of research ?
neutral	i can guarantee that all the older folk don_'_t appreciate screeching music blasting at them .
neutral	when i asked the checkout lady why they played such crap , she agreed and said the head_office dictated the music played , and also the temperature of the store !
neutral	regardless of where that store was located it was based on where the head_office was located and their weather that day !
neutral	the floor staff need lessons in customer service and manners , like the customer should have right of way when they are walking around , not the staff with their huge trolleys .
neutral	i have had my foot run over and almost been hit more than once , and then there is the reaching in front of me to stack the shelves , unbelievable !
neutral	no manners and no customer service skills at all !
neutral	the product came as requested without_any damage and responses from customer service were quick when i emailed them , however i was disappointed as i had ordered the product on the 00th_dec as a gift for someone for christmas thinking that was adequate time , the email i received on ordering said it should be dispatched within a week however it wasn_'_t actually dispatched until the 00st_dec to be delivered on the next working day which was the 00th_dec , i '_d already left to visit family for christmas so it arrived too late .
neutral	i would use marinestore again as this was the only issue however not if i needed something quickly or at this time of year .
neutral	my experience with scubastore in the beginning was overwhelmingly good .
neutral	but there were a couple of problems with the delivery , that i will comment later on in this review .
neutral	first i want to critize scubastore '_s ( or more likely outlet inn '_s ) way of handling unsubsciption of newsletters .
neutral	about a week after my purchase i started to recieve newsletters , that i did not remember subscribing for .
neutral	not only from scubastore , but one newsletter everyday from different shops from outlet inn .
neutral	when i wanted to unsubscribe , it was only possible from the italian webpage .
neutral	even after figuring_out how to unsubscribe , i started to recieve newsletters from time to time and more times i had to go to the webpage to unsubscribe .
neutral	this is to me annoying , as i am one of those persons , who_likes to keep the mail account free of spam .
neutral	not the best service !
neutral	at_least it would be better , if the unsubscription page was easily found in english .
neutral	second , i want to tell about the troubles i had with recieving my package . after having accepted the agreements and paid , the package was sent straight_away and got to bangkok , thailand , two_days after i paid .
neutral	but !
neutral	it seems like dhl , a worldwide company , lacks a bit in thailand .
neutral	all information i gave scubastore when i purchased seemed to get lost with the arrival in bangkok .
neutral	after long conversations over phone , they sent me an_email with some details of procedures i had to follow ( duty tax ).
neutral	but apparently they only gave half the informations which lead to further phone_calls .
neutral	they seemed to have lost my email adress the moment after they sent me an_email , and all their promises of contacting me wasn_'_t followed through .
neutral	therefore i had to contact them over and over again , and this caused my package to be delayed by about a week from it arrived in bangkok until i recieved it on the island i '_m staying at , simply because they only gave half informations of procedures , and after days where nothing had happened , i would have to contact them again and again .
neutral	this said , i would use scubastore another time because it is cheap and seems to be a quick service , though not from thailand , as it is way to complicated .
neutral	but i did ask for some nutritional advise but received no response .
neutral	i hope to be able to seek some advice to the appropriate use of the products for my clients specific conditions based on the recommended dosage and others .
neutral	it takes to long for the dvd to arrive , and you have to pay postage .
neutral	luckily my husband was able to repair the damage that had occurred - the metal fitting had been bent in transit .
neutral	the material was as expected from the sample i had ordered ( good part of service as was free ) and the time taken to receive was ok too .
neutral	the packaging , however , needs to be sturdier in order to prevent_damage to mechanism .
neutral	sorry to expensive
neutral	before my purchase i rang to get some further information , to make_sure i was buying a suitable i instrument .
neutral	felt a little fobbed_off as the lady on the phone only gave yes / no answers and did not elaborate at all .
neutral	item was bought based on reviews only .
neutral	i was kept_fully_informed regarding delivery .
neutral	having previously had a problem with slow delivery and communication i was disappointed to have the same problem again .
neutral	having received a confirmation that my order had been despatched was provided with a tracking_number which was not recognised .
neutral	upon querying this was told that it would only be available to track once the parcel had left their warehouse .
neutral	fair_enough but subsequent tracking came up with ' not collected ' and then somewhat odd a missing document .
neutral	0 - 0 delivery days became 0 .
neutral	the box used for the order was rather substandard quality and was coming apart by the time i received my order .
neutral	i spent extra to get a larger bunch of flowers and although the box was massive , the flowers were not .
neutral	beautiful flowers but not nearly enough of them .
neutral	i upgraded from the standard to the deluxe_version , but was disappointed to discover that only 0 extra stems were added to the bouquet that was delivered and it really wasn_'_t worth the extra_cost .
neutral	on the plus_side , the delivery was quick and efficient .
neutral	i have used halfpriceperfumes for a while , you cannot deny the great value for money , but when i order sane , sensible sunglasses , for sane , sensible ( older ) relatives , ( silver & black , & black / purple ), & being sent bright sickly green for one order , & the brightest blue for the other , is no good for me to give as presents .
neutral	they have gone in a charity box .
neutral	that order wasn_'_t good value .
neutral	frustratingly , they won_'_t deliver so you can collect your parts in store - so with working full time and a large parcel being delivered , i '_d another trip to the post_office depot to collect it .
neutral	the part itself was fine , but i do resent paying delivery charges when you know it won_'_t be successfully delivered , and it would be much more convenient to pick it up yourself .
neutral	i haven_'_t seen the flowers so cannot_comment on the quality however while placing the order i did ask that if the recipient was not in , to place them around the back of the property unaware that access is difficult .
neutral	the flowers were delivered between 0 . 00am - 0 . 00am when the recipient was in and available to receive them however the joy of surprise was denied her because the flowers were simply left at the front of her property , open to being taken by anyone passing .
neutral	thankfully they were not taken but i had to contact her and spoil the surprise by asking her to go and look outside .
neutral	she was delighted but i am disappointed with the way in which they were delivered .
neutral	easy to use website and many goods are cheaper_than competitors .
neutral	i chose this retailer because i was looking for a particular lipstick which i couldn_'_t find anywhere_else on the web .
neutral	bit_miffed at having to pay postage , so decided that as i was going to have to pay for this i might as well increase my order and make good use of it .
neutral	lo and behold , as a previous review mentioned , i got an_email that 0 of the 0 goods i ordered were out of stock .
neutral	sadly , one of those items was the lipstick i had been searching for .
neutral	why should this happen with computerised stock control ?
neutral	to be fair i was asked whether i wanted them to cancel the order and make a refund or whether to carry on and deliver the one item they did have in stock .
neutral	good communication , but should not offer goods which they do not have in stock .
neutral	the whole_process has_been a waste of my time and i '_m now being showered with unwanted sales emails and still trying to unsubscribe from this company . that was the decider for me that i will not use this company again .
neutral	i ordered a camping kitchen and needed it quite urgently so i requested express delivery and paid £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	0_days passed and my package had not been delivered .
neutral	now 0_days away from my trip i called your customer service desk who advised that the deliverly of the product i ordered would not actually be in until the following week .
neutral	i ordered another kitchen which was more_expensive so had to pay the difference but luckily this was delivered the day before our trip .
neutral	the lady i spoke to on the service desk was very apologetic and helpful but it would have been nice to have been advised of the delay prior to me having to ring .
neutral	i have booked with low_cost holidays several_times and always find them very good on price and documentation always comes straight through .
neutral	howecer this time i have been charged_twice from my bank_account for the holiday -- not good .
neutral	then when asked for a refund customer service not very helpful .
neutral	hope the holiday is better_than the booking_system !
neutral	!
neutral	the photo was very difficult to upload to fit he photo frame
neutral	i booked parking on my smartphone and paid with visa_card .
neutral	i input the dayes and wet througb the various screens before inputting card_details .
neutral	bookibg was for 00 feb . booking was confirmed by email .
neutral	i noticed that the dates had defaulted to the date i had made the booking .
neutral	i sent an_email straight_away to cancel and amend the dates but wqs tol this was not acceptable .
neutral	they would not refund my payment .
neutral	therefore i paid for car_parking and never used it .
neutral	they got my money and did not provide the service .
neutral	despite several phone_calls to explain the situation they would not give me a refund or change the booking .
neutral	after sending this review , compnay got in touch and refunded my money , i have now booked correct dates with them as they were the most competitive price .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	the service was good but the item was not at all like the photo on the website !
neutral	because it was a wig i couldnt return it .
neutral	given that , i probably_wouldn_'_t buy again from this website .
neutral	i was so pleased to have found this site for distance_learning , however , i was bitterley disapointed when the materials arrived .
neutral	a single folder with very basic information and a lot of repetition .
neutral	the activities were ok and yes i learned alot , but the final activity for the sections were pointless .
neutral	the tutor experience was a waste of time as you could not directly contact him / her , you had to go through a third_party .
neutral	i have to admit that the feedback from the tutor was very good and thorough so this was not at all their fault .
neutral	i messaged the company via their online messaging service asking_questions about the module .
neutral	my question being was there essays and a final exam .
neutral	the answer was that this was correct .
neutral	however , there were no essays nor final exam .
neutral	this left me feeling my time was spent on something that a shool child could have done instead of my wanting to gain more advanced knowledge on the subject .
neutral	in total i feel that for what i paid , this was a disappointing experience as i have already said and i will not be recommending this to my friends and family .
neutral	bought this peplum as a gift .
neutral	the person is of average_height etc but the top may as well have been a bra top .. quite a lot shorter_than_expected .
neutral	pictures were of good quality but unfortunately as soon as i opened the calendar i noticed some sheets were already out of the metal coil .
neutral	as i turned the pages each page came lose from it '_s binding .
neutral	the calendar also started from october and i had expected it to be from january but i may have missed the description .
neutral	took a while to re - bind and then had to squash closed to keep it bound .
neutral	if you can '_t find it elsewhere it will be here , at a price .
neutral	delivery is good and ordering is easy .
neutral	i have rated drinks before but they never published - i didn_'_t like what i rated and said why .
neutral	nothing derogatory , just a simple description of how it wasn_'_t for me , but they never published .
neutral	so all we get are positive_reviews which is as good as worthless
neutral	i ordered my item and paid for it , i received an_email_telling_me 0 - 00 days for delivery .
neutral	00 days_later i asked where my item was and was informed they tried to contact there supplier but they were not open for a few_days but they would try when open .
neutral	i had to chase them to get an answer .
neutral	they finally got back to me to tell me that it would be with them in a week and then they would post royal_mail .
neutral	no actual date when it was expected or even a overnight postage to placate me .
neutral	another 0_weeks in total after my original 0 - 00 days delivery , who_knows_how long it would have been if i hadn_'_t been emailing for some information .
neutral	they had my money and so be it .
neutral	it did finally arrive and it was what i wanted and had paid for , so happy there .
neutral	but they need not to take money for items they do not hold in stock and have no idea when they will have in stock and they seriously need to learn customer service .
neutral	an_apology and saying you '_ll get back to someone , then getting back even if it is to say i know nothing yet , keeps your customers calm and happy .
neutral	being dismissive really not good .
neutral	it was nothing like a mini_cruise it was just like getting any normal ferry from one country to another , it was nothing special .
neutral	our meal on new years_eve was terrible and just not what we expected along wioth the entertainment which was also poor .
neutral	the process of booking is easy to follow .
neutral	but the service via phone is so bad .
neutral	after i made a booking , i called the customer service for some more info .
neutral	and confirmation to make myself comfortable .
neutral	i just asked how long will i receive the e_- ticket , the staff answered me with a strong unpleasant voice that it will be emailed to me within 00_hours .
neutral	then the second question , i asked about a change in price , what if the price become increased later on , can i cancel the booking or not since the price doesn_'_t follow as it stated before and i might not be able to cover up the increase in ticket price .
neutral	the staff just answered me that this doesn_'_t happen in most_cases , just some cases then tell me if i really want to cancel , i will be partially charged or fined because the company will offer the options for me but if i still want to cancel then it will be my fault .
neutral	so i will be charged or fined for the cancellation which doesn_'_t make any sense since the company cannot keep the price as promised , they shouldn_'_t charge me any penny .
neutral	and this kind of answer is quite rude and not responsible for the customers .
neutral	besides , the staff , after he said all of that , he just immediately said " thank_you , have a nice day " and hung_up without waiting for my reply or even care if i still have something_else to ask or want to know and he didn_'_t say bye or good night or even ask if i have any_questions .
neutral	ps .
neutral	many comments i have read have made me worry because many cases faced with misspelling in their names and the flight was re - scheduled and the company didn_'_t inform the customers and re - issue a new e_- ticket for them which made customers faced with no - choice situation at the airport on the flying date and time when the desk cannot check - in and verify / print them the tickets resulted_in missing the flight and had to buy new flight which caused more money .
neutral	i am so scared of this kind of situation and especially the change in flight .
neutral	really quite disappointed now that i should have chosen to buy with sta instead which is £_00 higher than travel up .
neutral	because at_least , sta is really reliable and trustworthy .
neutral	pay a bit more but happy is much much_better_than pay a few less but extremely worry .
neutral	just warn but so far so good .
neutral	haven_'_t faced with any_problems but just got annoyed by many bad_reviews and comments from previous customers .
neutral	need to wait and see .
neutral	ps . 0 most of the reviews and comments here are not reliable regarding the flight or problems because i found out these comments were asked to give feedback after they finished processing the payment and the booking .
neutral	so it '_s all about the website and booking process which is just the first step or fundamental step that should face any_problems but later on , they might face with e_- ticket issuing failure , flight cancellation problem , change in flight schedule problem , misspelled name , delay in e_- ticket issuing , increase in price later on and so on .
neutral	so i just want to recommend that these reviews are not that much helpful since the more serious steps are the next ones after booking not in the booking process and these comments just left for booking process not the next serious and important steps .
neutral	anyway , i will pray for my own sake and lucks not to face with any_problems and every thing goes well smooth .
neutral	finger crossed .
neutral	going out everything was fine , quick deposit of car and speedy transfer .
neutral	however , on our return we had to wait 00_mins from ringing the company to actually getting picked_up .
neutral	i have been shopping with achica for a number of years_now and have made 00 + orders through them .
neutral	most items , i have been very happy with and the prices whilst not " bargains " are usually pretty good .
neutral	some of the brands they sell are of the higher end but i would say there is also a lot of cheaper rubbish with plenty of marketing spiel .
neutral	customer service is dreadful , however .
neutral	my most_recent order has now required 0 queries to be submitted online in order to chase - there is no way of contacting them by phone .
neutral	for their positioning in the market place , this needs sorting_out and really isn_'_t acceptable these days .
neutral	i ordered two pots of osmo_oil , but one was the wrong_colour .
neutral	replacements were sent straight_away .
neutral	fortunately , the order wasn_'_t urgent , but there would have been a problem if it had been .
neutral	i arrived at the car_hire desk and was told that the collision_damage excess_waiver was not included , even_though i had already paid additional for it and it was stated on the document that i showed to the person at the desk .
neutral	they told me that it was irrelevant to them .
neutral	i had to use an additional credit_card to put up a bond of 0000 euros to pre_- cover for the cdw excess .
neutral	if i had not had this additional credit_card i would not have been able to hire the car .
neutral	this caused a good deal of concern and i would have thought twice about booking had this not been clarified ahead of time .
neutral	i am not sure if i would book through rental_cars again , entirely because of this issue .
neutral	i was a bit let_down with costume looks what it is cheep and will not be wearing it the so called belt was just a bit of fabric to be tied around the waist and the dress did not hang right the best thing was the head dress waist of money
neutral	have been a customer for a few_years but have noticed a decline in the time from order to delivery .
neutral	ordered the peacock outfit for my daughters fancy_dress animal theme birthday_party .
neutral	was surprised to see it because i thought it to be an unusual choice of costume .
neutral	order it the afternoon before the party .
neutral	party was to begin by noon and so i choose the express delivery that suggested delivery by 00 am ( a major risk i know ).
neutral	the costume was delivered 00_mins earlier_than suggested .
neutral	gave_me enough time to do some minor amendments .
neutral	the tail is completely fabric made with elastic armbands to secure it .
neutral	although this was comfy , it was flimsy and so kept bending and folding over_backwards .
neutral	i put a couple stitches in the headband to the tail .
neutral	this kept the tail upright .
neutral	very thin to touch and obviously cheaply_made .
neutral	other than that it looked great .
neutral	poor quality and not worth the price .
neutral	if purchased you will look great but may not get a second wear out of it .
neutral	only_downside to this purchase i ordered size 0 flip_flop & was sent size 0 when i have tried to return & re order size 0 is out of stock i am going on hol in 0_days so now in panic to buy from elsewhere
neutral	parking is good but 0 % credit_card charge is a bit much .
neutral	booked glasgow_airport_parking the week after and they do not charge anything for paying by credit_cards .
neutral	the starlings in my garden are still managing to get a beakful
neutral	( although probably not as much as before ) of the suet cake .
neutral	it '_s certainly made them have to work harder , but they can still , just , reach the cake .
neutral	this refers to a squirrel - proof suet cage bird_feeder
neutral	somewhat disappointed that the vibrant_colours of " carousel " did not come through with those delivered as an easter surprise to my daughter .
neutral	the florist could have made more of an effort to replicate the colours .
neutral	if you buy big quantities is excellent and worthwhile otherwise it '_s not worth
neutral	the flowers were lovely .
neutral	but ( and there always is ) my son had gone to pick the baby and partner from hospital , so they were just left on the doorstep !!
neutral	not good .
neutral	diane rigden
neutral	searched for flights from manchester and didn_'_t read carefully enough , ended_up with flights booked from east_midlands airport !!!
neutral	nightmare to get to for us !
neutral	!
neutral	good pricing and free delivery but once order is placed this company is a nightmare !
neutral	they send you a dispatch email days after you receive the goods .
neutral	and don_'_t start me on the delivery !
neutral	they use yodel who just dump your order outside your house , even in the rain and whether your in or not !
neutral	then when you call pet_supermarket to complain you have to wait around 00 - 00_mins to get through .
neutral	they promised me they were stopping using yodel in january but they were using them just last_week .
neutral	i have ordered from medic_animal before with no_problems , however this time round was let_down when part of my order was missing .
neutral	i understand we all make mistake but it took three phone_calls and a month later to finally get things sorted_out thanks to meera a competent member of staff .
neutral	do not visit the cheltenham store , as we did , for any help or advice in choosing your items as my wife was spoken to very rudely and in a patronising manner .
neutral	we left the store and purchased the items online .
neutral	when it came to the delivery of the items , we received a call to inform us that the van was 00 - 00_mins_away .
neutral	i promptly made my way home , from work , and arrived home well within the timescale to find the delivery van waiting outside .
neutral	i was then told that i should have been home for their arrival and that they were just about to leave without completing my delivery .
neutral	the items we purchased are faultless , the service we received was from employees with bad attitudes .
neutral	i was able to pick my delivery day .
neutral	i waited in all day but the delivery never arrived .
neutral	i had a tracking_number and at 0 . 00pm it said delivery was attempted but it hadn_'_t been .
neutral	i contacted the depot right away but all i got was empty apologies .
neutral	the item i ordered was part of a margarita gift set we were giving as a wedding present .
neutral	as i was leaving the next_day to go to london , where the wedding was , i had to leave without the most_important part of the gift - the tequila .
neutral	getting the item is as important as a good website , shopping etc experience - so to wait in all day for the delivery only to have city_link not bothered if they deliver your stuff or not has ruined this shopping_experience .
neutral	next time i '_ll go to an off - licence and take my chances .
neutral	i also emailed thedrinkshop . com at the same time i contacted city_link but got no reply - so they didn_'_t care about my shopping_experience then - why care now ?
neutral	i received a card from the courier stating this was the second time i had missed their delivery and that the parcel would now need picking_up from courier '_s warehouse which was 00 miles_away .
neutral	they never even left the parcel with a neighbour .
neutral	i am upset and disappointed i had to take a day off work to go and pick my parcel up as well as the expense it cost me .
neutral	i can_assure you that i never received a card through my letter_box on the first delivery so therefore dispute they had tried to deliver twice and subsequently never got the opportunity to arrange a different day when i was in .
neutral	unfortunately i would not order from you again in case again i had to travel 00 miles to collect my parcel !
neutral	helpful on phone but took a while arriving
neutral	the net_curtain was very good quality for the money but i ordered 00 " drop and received 00 " drop , so was initially disappointed .
neutral	decided to keep it because didn , t want the hassle of returning it .
neutral	i have just read your reply and yes i was told my item was in stock and then i ordered it .
neutral	the order was acknowledge .
neutral	i then received an_email to say it was out of stock and had not been sent out .
neutral	ok i had to accept that .
neutral	then i received a further item to say it was in stock .
neutral	again i have ordered the item , but to date have not received it .
neutral	has it been sent ?
neutral	i like the range of products , and free delivery and returns .
neutral	the range of payment options is good too .
neutral	but everything is far too expensive .
neutral	i '_m after a new phone and they are selling the 00gb nexus 0 for £_000 more than elsewhere !
neutral	i '_d buy more from them if the prices were lower .
neutral	the site was good to use but i wanted and was expecting free delivery , as stated .
neutral	i went back and started again , and again , but couldn_'_t see how free delivery , seemingly ineviitably , became a charge of £ 0 . 00 !
neutral	!
neutral	when i ordered these for my daughter the bouquet looked luxurious and full .
neutral	she sent me a photo of the flowers and i noticed the roses had been replaced by canterbury bells and the whole effect was not the same !
neutral	the bouquet looked sparser .
neutral	and i payed extra for a premium florist !
neutral	my phone arrived swiftly - quicker_than i had expected .
neutral	it is in full working order but i was a bit surprised that in addition to the unlocking , it seemed to have wiped many of the phones settings / features etc during some reformatting - so in fact there were no_longer any nokia themes , wallpapers , tones etc left on the phone .
neutral	also the order i put in was for a pink 0000 but i received a black one !
neutral	oh well , never mind ....
neutral	i was disappointed with the product .
neutral	i ordered a note book with photos on and the photos were upside_down .
neutral	unfortunately i didn_'_t notice this until i had given it to my mum on mothers_day .
neutral	i was so looking_forward to her opening it .
neutral	i ordered this for my granddaughter and her partner who had just lost a baby ..... for the price i expected more than 0a0 pages , one of whichwas laminated ..... a fair bit of detail but i was expecting more ....
neutral	i purchased a set of thank_you cards which included 0 photos .
neutral	it was fairly quick and simple to put_together and delivered quickly .
neutral	however , when i got the cards through the colour looked too pale and the copy looked very slightly lopsided , which is surprising as i have used optimalprint before and not had an issue .
neutral	i bought arthri aid from you for my cat '_s arthritis .
neutral	you said i could add it to his drinking_water .
neutral	but you didn_'_t say it was a horrible tast and that my cat wouldn_'_t touch it .
neutral	waste of money mrs haughton
neutral	0 : if i wanted chrome , i would ask for it .
neutral	please stop trying to make us download it all the time .
neutral	0 : censorship for political reasons , regardless of who '_s opinion it is , is never in the best interest of the people .
neutral	there are lots of things that advertisers cannot offer on google and i do not appreciate your agenda stopping me seeing stuff i want .
neutral	if it is illegal - then fine .
neutral	otherwise , back off .
neutral	ordered a few engraved memory_sticks to sample out for business use ( engraved with company name etc and to go out to customers ).
neutral	claimed they came with a fitted presentation_box .
neutral	not the case , supplied in cheap dog - earred cardboard_boxes .
neutral	no response to emails sent regarding the above , was going to order around 00 but glad i got just a sample few now .
neutral	with the amount of suppliers online , won_'_t be using this company for this product again .
neutral	if the items are in stock , they are sent very fast .
neutral	quality is very good .
neutral	but if the items are not in stock , which i have been told after i placed the order , they have not been good at letting_me know when i might expect delivery .
neutral	i have had to chase them for updates .
neutral	took over an_hour from entering office to driving off in car .
neutral	we hired polo or similar and got a 0_seater scenic - for 0 of us ? trying to park a car that size in french towns was a challenge i could have done without .
neutral	was really surprised to have 0000 euros deposit secured on my card for the car , ( i '_m used to pledging about £_000 )
neutral	half an_hour after returning the car i received a phone_call from a woman from the office who was insistent that i had retained the keys and was getting more and more frustrated and would not accept it when i said i had not ( i had not ).
neutral	what could i do ?
neutral	asked her to look again , but she never rang back to apologise or let_me know , when she found them .
neutral	tracking was out on the car and my right arm and upper chest became painful ( so much so that it kept me awake at night ) as i was constantly pulling the wheel to the right as i was driving .
neutral	have had more straightforward hiring experiences , but given the convenience of hiring in dieppe and driving a rhd car in france , i would hire from europcar again only be more careful about making_sure i got a car more suitable to my needs and make a memorable point of handing_over the keys .
neutral	the tracking i could do nothing about , as you don_'_t know it '_s off until you '_ve driven it a while .
neutral	bit disappointed in the merry_christmas_hamper .
neutral	doesn_'_t look much .
neutral	tha cheaper one is much_better value .
neutral	delivery is excellent and very easy order process .
neutral	ordering was quite simple but when i saw the delivered flowers they were not quite the same as i had ordered .
neutral	i think every effort should be made to keep as close to the pictured arrangements as possible .
neutral	especially the non perishable parts
neutral	i ordered some flowers for a special_occasion , my grandmothers 00th_birthday .
neutral	whilst_travelling to scotland on wednesday 00th_may i received a telephone_call from an e_- florist representative to advise that unfortunately , the exact flower_arrangement i had ordered online were not available .
neutral	i was informed however that an arrangement from the local_florist to my grandmother '_s address were willing to provide a bouquet with the same colours as my original order , although the flowers would be with different .
neutral	i stated that i was willing to go_ahead with this , and the gent assured that the bouquet would be made just as special , and stressed that it would be delivered at my stated property by 00 :_00pm ; as i had previously requested .
neutral	he apologised for any inconvenience_caused .
neutral	i was very impressed with this service and appreciative of his help and manner since a problem had arisen and was then solved promptly .
neutral	however , the flowers were then not delivered by the specified 00 :_00pm time on thurs_00th_may - which i had verbally confirmed to me the day previous would be .
neutral	a surprise party was being thrown for my grandmother and arrangements for her to be collected from her home had been made for 00 :_00pm ; hence the 00 :_00pm delivery requirement .
neutral	a relative staying with her contacted me to advise as they left for the party , that no flowers has_been delivered .
neutral	upon returning to her house after the party , a bouquet had been left on her front_door_step .
neutral	had i have known that the delivery time would not have been met i would have simply purchased a bouquet from a local_florist to our hotel to take along myself .
neutral	i understand that there can be delays , however on this occasion when i had not been provided with the original flower order and that they were not delivered when i was assured they would be , i cannot help but be disappointed with the overall service received .
neutral	products great however recent paying extra for delivery of items over_£ 0 regardless of weight and sent in enormous_box which is waste of packaging .
neutral	i bought 0 sets of party bags which were sent in very large box for their size and was charged postage £ 0 . 00 which i consider excessibe for 00 paper party bags .
neutral	currently have an issue with label for tnt collection which seems to be unavailable to print
neutral	the website was easy to navigate and the booking quick to make .
neutral	however , i understand being charged for a change in ferries , but we were charged an admin_fee because we bought a new car after making the booking , so had to change the car details .
neutral	not impressed !
neutral	only part of my order has_been delivered , still_waiting for rest of it .
neutral	have phoned cheap_smells and they said rest of order is on way but heavier items are sent differently ?!
neutral	over a week waiting for delivery isn_'_t acceptable in my opinion , i have ordered these products from other_companies and received within 0_days !
neutral	very efficent service but returns are an issue .
neutral	complicated instructions for returns .
neutral	company did not make it clear about the return_label which was mentioned but not enclosed and no insructions to contact the company .
neutral	i made three_attempts to return at post_office .
neutral	had to request a label and was then given a collection time between_0am and 0pm .
neutral	i just left parcel on doorstep but in a city this would not be an option .
neutral	for that reason i wont_be ordering again .
neutral	one whole month i had to wait for compensation payment for a parcel that parcel0go had lost .
neutral	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
neutral	many_times with the livechat i was sent away and told to wait with no direct answer .
neutral	the people ( i '_m guessing they were people on the other end ) were rude and not very helpful at all .
neutral	that was until today when ashley was able to sort_out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
neutral	he gave_me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
neutral	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
neutral	all in all i see that there are some workers who literally carry the company .
neutral	hopefully all the hard_work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
neutral	thank_you ashley :)
neutral	great garment once i took delivery of the item ordered .
neutral	they were apologetic but it meant a trip into_town to return the unwanted item even_though there was no postage to pay .
neutral	not bad cheap prices but could do with a mobile site .
neutral	quite difficult to use on a mobile phone
neutral	unfortunately the blind i received was to small , as through no falt of yours i ordered in centimetres and should have ordered in inches , so now have a blind i can '_t use .
neutral	this mistake is easily done as i did put inches in , went back to make_sure my messurments were correct and somehow it changed back to centimetres , i failed to see this and went_ahead with the order .
neutral	regards dianne mccormick .
neutral	ordered on the 00th_jan and paid for delivery within 0 working_days , allowed for friday 00th , monday 00th and thought tuesday 00th would be 0rd working day ( as stated ' within ' 0 working_days ) but delivery still not made .
neutral	luckily do not need outfit until saturday 00st but when you pay for a service it is expected .
neutral	i know this is not the fault of jokers_masquerade as they have shipped the product so come on royal_mail ' get your act_together !'
neutral	flowers not as_described realise its the busy_period ( xmas ) but was not happy with them at all however customer service i cannot_fault at all and was offered a refund or new flowers straight_away - would not put me off using again just not at busy_periods !
neutral	little disappointed that , although the parcel arrived quickly , our order was for white bags and we received red ( kept them as we were desperate !
neutral	), and although the boxes looked fine from the outside the bags inside had been squashed in , so that they were creased .
neutral	very disappointed in the garage !
neutral	having turned_up early to get two front_tyres_changed , it then took 0hr 00mins for the work to be carried .
neutral	the mechanics seemed more interested in walking about the workshop floor than actually doing the work !
neutral	only the trainee seemed to be working .
neutral	this is not just my feelings but those of the two bt engineers who were also waiting a considerable_amount of time .
neutral	when they did do the work , they sat in the car without_any seat protectors and left grease on the steering_wheel - this matched the grease hand print on the wing !
neutral	they also wanted to see the spare_tyre - but mine does not have a spare_tyre just a refill can !
neutral	!
neutral	despite this the website service was easy and very user_friendly .
neutral	i ordered a phone on 0 december and it finally arrived just before xmas day .
neutral	my emails were ignored and i could not get through on the helpline - every time i rang i was placed even further back in the queue !
neutral	my son eventually managed to get through in the middle of the night after which the order was despatched , with no explanation of the delay .
neutral	customer service very poor so would not use again .
neutral	it is a shame that having such a nice website they provide such poor packaging .
neutral	my sunglasses arrive in a bashed and dented box , the case has seen better days and i feel very disapointed .
neutral	meat missing , rang to rectify .
neutral	advised they would sent missing meat and would be with us by friday .
neutral	friday came - no meat .
neutral	lady very apologetic and advised that colleague had not re issued meat as he had said ! offered refund , assured meat would be here by wednesday ....
neutral	fingers_crossed i receive my order by tomorrow !
neutral	let_down and a little put off by my first experience :-(
neutral	v
neutral	an item within my order was received with the security_tag still attached .
neutral	it was a xmas_present and luckily , i took the item out of the cellophane to check the size before wrapping .
neutral	i took_advantage of the ordering system to avoid shopping in the stores .
neutral	i logged my complaint on the email link i received and to date no one called back .
neutral	i tried_calling but was 00th in a queue so i made decision to take a couple of hours off work to take the item back to have the tag removed .
neutral	i still hadn_'_t received a reply to my email so 0_days_later i called again this time 0 th in a queue .
neutral	i eventually spoke to a representative who was very apologetic and offered to refund an amount to my card .
neutral	on a positive_note the items were as always of excellent quality .
neutral	regards
neutral	my item was supposed to be in stock and even_though the delivery was charged and payment taken the initial delivery date was one week , this has now moved to three_weeks and still not a sign of the jacket i have ordered .
neutral	i ordered cosequin from you as my normal place i use seemed to only offer the capsules and not the tablets , i searched and found viovet which had exactly_what i wanted - the tablets which were shown online in a plastic pot as i usually get .
neutral	however when they came they came in two packets full of tablets in individual plastic things that i have to push out ( like a tablet pack we have ) and not in the pot .
neutral	i would rather of known this before i purchased as its a faff to get them all out of the packs , and hard to see how many approx are left as i usually see how many are left in the pot .
neutral	is this how they come now ?
neutral	and if so can you change your website so people know .
neutral	lucklily i had a pot left from last time so i '_ve filled it up but when they came i wasn_'_t very impressed .
neutral	i don_'_t think rajapack trust their online ordering facility !
neutral	after_placing an order online , a salesperson telephones me and confirms all_aspects of the order which doubles my time and involvement !
neutral	either offer online ordering comparable to rscomponents / farnell / radpidonline / viking and trust it / fix it if it needs improvement or just accept telephone orders .
neutral	i shall probably order by phone next time .
neutral	i met the recipient at her 00th_birthday_party last night and was told she had not received my flowers .
neutral	your email stated they had been left in a secure_place at the - address around 00 . 00 and she arrived home at 0 . 00 but the only flowers there were from marks and spencer who had put them over the side_gate and left a card through the door advising her of this .
neutral	it was very embarrassing and disappointing .
neutral	the tiles seem good although we have not been able to put them up yet , and they were comparatively well priced .
neutral	however , i would not buy from you again or recommend you unless you change your courier company ( interlink_express ).
neutral	they are completely_useless and this has_been the case on several_occasions .
neutral	see their page on this site for further unhappy recipients of their ' service '!
neutral	!
neutral	very quick service from travelpharm , however they sent the pills to my home address and not my work address as requested .
neutral	they also were sent through the regular postal service , not signed for as indicated on their website .
neutral	i was quite disappointed with this , as i don_'_t think sending untracked medicines through the mail is a good idea !
neutral	not sure i would order from this website again
neutral	the quality of the service in terms of ordering online , delivery and timing is excellent .
neutral	the blinds looks really beautiful .
neutral	exactly_what we wanted .
neutral	but the fixings are not solid enough and we have to be very careful when we pull the string .
neutral	a pity .
neutral	i would defo recommend this website but i would prefer to have an_email to confirm order & any updates
neutral	overall the experience was satisfactory , and i '_d use the service again as long as it remains good value .
neutral	but there were problems .
neutral	the printed instructions for finding the contact were simply wrong - pick_up instead of drop_off .
neutral	it was difficult to hear any alternative instructions on a busy m00 .
neutral	so we wasted 00_minutes in the wrong place , then got lost trying to correct it , and the driver when we found him looked pretty disconsolate !
neutral	upon return , the company '_s phone was unavailable for a while , which is pretty scary .
neutral	no back - up number or alternative instructions .
neutral	this must be fixed .
neutral	we didn_'_t have a long wait for the car to arrive .
neutral	the drivers were both professional .
neutral	have used tyre_shopper many_times in the past and always reccomend them .
neutral	this time , however , let_down by the tyre supplier .
neutral	i did not have the tyres_fitted as they were not delivered .
neutral	in fairness to the staff at national and tyre_shopper they endeavoured to put things right and i have expectations when i get the tyres_fitted in week '_s time , with free tracking for the inconvenience .
neutral	hence the low star_rating - but i would add - this was not the fault of tyre_shopper - but the tyre manufacturer / supplier .
neutral	the items ordered arrived in a jiffy_bag and this is fine but the items inside were covered in grey dust which went_onto the items when unpacked .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t have been a problem if they were not fabric sleeping_bags which now has a dirty stain that won_'_t come out !
neutral	easy to get the car and drop - off was simple and swift .
neutral	however , during quite moderate use , the car developed a number of faults : the dashboard light started going off for no apparent_reason , which was worrying as the entire display was digital so you couldn_'_t see what speed you were doing ; the left - signal indicator light went out towards the end of the rental ; the plastic protector in the trunk came loose ; and as a short person i found the car_seat hard to adjust to a reasonable position .
neutral	the company was fine and the actual rental was well - managed and fairly easy .
neutral	do watch out for the one - way fee , it '_s ferocious .
neutral	the costumes were very good and it was a very straightforward website to use but the postage was way too expensive particularly when the goods didn_'_t arrive for 0_days .
neutral	i hate to think how long standard delivery would take .
neutral	when i found flights to rome for 00 a head i thought it was a great deal .
neutral	with all the extra costs it ended_up being so much more .
neutral	also they have lowered their hand_luggage_allowance to 00kg and charge a whopping 00_quid for a 00_kg back for check in .
neutral	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it '_s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
neutral	mum_loved her flowers was a lovely surprise shame it was late in the evening when she got them
neutral	the furniture is very good quality & just what we picked , however 0 out out of 0 pieces had damage to them , even_though the furniture was extremely well_packaged .
neutral	this was sorted_out by custumer services very promptly and effectively , but i do think furniture should be checked more carefully before sending it to customers who have paid good money for it .
neutral	the mirror we received with our sofas was all damaged at the back , which my husband had to fix him self because we couldn_'_t be bothered with the hassle of sending it back .
neutral	one of the drawers on the 0 drawer_chest sticks and makes a clicking noise when you open it but quite honestly the thought of packaging it all up again and returning it fills me with horror so i '_ll live with it .
neutral	i didn_'_t think too much about unpacking it and disposing of the packaging , if i had i probably would have ordered elsewhere . as a single woman it was no easy task getting everything out of the boxes whilst trying to keep the boxes intact in case of return , it took me all morning to unpack four items , thankfully the 0th item a glazed cabinet wouldn_'_t go through the front_door and lobby so the delivery guys took it out of the box ( once i '_d signed a waiver ), not sure how i would have managed it on my own .
neutral	would much rather have sprung for a delivery charge and had it delivered and unpacked and the packing taken_away ( like dfs or furniture_village ).
neutral	as it is my recycling_bin has_been stuffed to the brim with cardboard for two solid weeks and i have spent a considerable_amount of time breaking it down to fit it in . never again and it '_s not like the furniture is cheaper or there '_s a discount for quantity .
neutral	perhaps you could offer a delivery cost as an option that would include unpacking and disposing of all the packaging .
neutral	now i '_m not laying the fault for smashed tiles at the feet of walls and floors , as it may well have been the courier launching the boxes into the back of the van .
neutral	the tiles were very well_packaged and clearly_marked ' fragile ', yet i received one box where half the tiles were ' snapped ' along one edge .
neutral	luckily i '_d ordered plenty and it didn_'_t impact on getting the job_done .
neutral	now that '_s off my mind , let '_s talk about the service from walls and floors .
neutral	the tiles were exactly as depicted and described on the website .
neutral	the price was excellent ( there was a sale on when i ordered ) and they arrived very quickly .
neutral	no chase_up calls , no_fuss !
neutral	would i order from here again ?
neutral	absolutely !
neutral	however , please have a word with your couriers and ask them to be gentle .
neutral	i have placed two orders with beauty_bay and both_times the length of time for delivery has_been unacceptable .
neutral	the last time i paid for next_day delivery and it didn_'_t happen .
neutral	i will not be ordering from them again .
neutral	how often do i need reminding that i have ordered something .
neutral	this just got annoying .
neutral	also despite what the website said there were no deliveries on sunday 0nd_december .
neutral	we have had several items in the past , and when we received delivery all packaging was removed and the item was photographed in our property .
neutral	not any more , the fridge_freezer was put in the middle of the kitchen_floor and i was left to deal with it .
neutral	it was all delivered on time so that was good .
neutral	the only issue , but it is quite a big issue was that some of the tins of cat_food were damaged in transit which_meant that when i opened the tins , the food was mouldy !
neutral	not good as this has cost me £ 0 . 00 so far so not very happy at the moment .
neutral	: 0 (
neutral	a few seconds ago
neutral	not as good as expected
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of glasses on 00th_october .
neutral	one pair haven_'_t arrived yet , the pair that arrived yesterday were broken .
neutral	so not a very good start .
neutral	especially as the ones i had before broke after a year ( so they were out of warranty ) makes me think i should use high_street_opticians in future even_though a bit more_expensive .
neutral	the service from kiddies_kingdom was good when it comes to sending the product but the delivery wasn_'_t .
neutral	the delivery man was actually seen leaving after just putting a card through the door without_knocking - i mean , why_bother walking to the door without_knocking !
neutral	thankfully managed to call him back but he wasn_'_t happy about it - very miserable man !
neutral	i sent a message to kiddies_kingdom about it but they didn_'_t reply !
neutral	just glad i got my goods .
neutral	did not recieve order in time so was unable to use and will now have to send back
neutral	this was my first time using this company .
neutral	the picture_shown was completely_different to how the flowers actually turned_out .
neutral	the flowers were given as a surprise to my best friend as it was her 00st_birthday and it was quite upsetting as she told me she had to throw some away as they were dead .
neutral	delivery was quick and she still liked the flowers as she said they were a big bunch but not really satisfied as i think i would have got better flowers for over_£_00 .
neutral	was straight_forward enough but took a while to receive my cheque although i would use envirophone again
neutral	i wanted to change a flight , but had to phone up to do it , i was waiting for the person to read through t & c of the airline for 00_minutes , and still didn_'_t manage to change the flight .
neutral	if i could change flight online i would give 0_stars , however this experience may result in me booking further flights for my company direct with the airline .
neutral	love my iphone .
neutral	but dont love that although i aready pay for a data pack , they are charging me for an iphone data pack as well !
neutral	we used this company last_year and were really impressed with their efficiency , hence we opted to use them again this time .
neutral	sorry to say we did not have a positive_experience on this occasion .
neutral	driver was not at arranged meeting_point on time , it was frustrating watching other_travellers meet and greet drivers coming and going while we were still_waiting .
neutral	in the end i left my husband to wait alone while i checked our_luggage in .
neutral	return collection of car was also long_winded , will probably try another firm next journey .
neutral	hi imade a mistake ordering the wrong type of frames consequently my bifocals wouldnt work properly in the glasses . i spoke to an optitian but he was unable to offer any practical help so i had to return the glasses . ann butterfield
neutral	i was expecting a better quality of glass and picture , felt the price was a little high for the item we recieved .
neutral	unfortunately the reds on the canvas came out brighter than the reds in the photo file ; making the peoples_faces look very red and sunburnt !
neutral	a cheap fast service but will be hesitant ordering again because of the colours changing
neutral	the web_site was very frustrating .
neutral	needed to rotate my pictures when uploaded but the editing tool kept saying it was done but then when back on picture it had not worked .
neutral	also not sure what the frown faces where for ?
neutral	i '_ve been using the liberro ecig for around two years_now & when i first started the quality seemed good , although two years on i '_ve received faulty batteries & tips that don_'_t work on a few occasions .
neutral	also they often don_'_t have the item you want as it '_s out of stock & there can be a 0 week wait which is really not good if you are a regular smoker like me .
neutral	if you receive a faulty product & contact them , they will try & tell you that you are doing something wrong & fob you off ,
neutral	however they did replace a pack of tips for me once , i had to return them first before they would send new ones out & then they told me they had tested them & that there was nothing wrong with them ( lies ).
neutral	i have spent on average around £_00 a month over 0years sometimes more , i feel that they should have some sort of loyalty to long_standing customers & replace items without a lecture .
neutral	i am_currently looking at other_places to buy from as the quality has dropped ..
neutral	i ordered some birkenstocks but it wasnt mentioned anywhere on the page that they wrre slimfit .
neutral	the product was ok and arrived when it said it would but feel this could be better advertised .
neutral	i sent my phone off but had a few problems with checkmend , fonebank were good occasionally on keeping_me in the loop of what was going on , but where i was meant to receive £_000 for my blackberry ive only received a cheque of £_00 without_any note or phonecall to say why they are taking £_00 off the price they said in the first place which i think is really unfair .
neutral	thanks fonebank , much_appreciated
neutral	ordered a few dvds before christmas hoping they '_d be there before .
neutral	sadly they arrived aferwards .
neutral	good price though - cheaper_than hmv
neutral	i was disappointed that they were not delivered in the morning , i think in retrospect
neutral	it '_s worth_paying the extra to have them delivered then , unfortunately they were out when they were delivered and left on the doorstep , my choice never the less i was a bit_worried_about them so texted the receiver
neutral	which spoilt the surprise ..
neutral	the flower choice is very good and they text the progress , is there a way to ask for a time_slot ?
neutral	my flowers didn_'_t leave the deport till after ten am
neutral	i didn_'_t receive the size i ordered then the size i ordered wasn_'_t available which was rather annoying .
neutral	it was a bit_slow getting here but the return , bizarrely , was much_quicker .
neutral	communication and service were ok
neutral	hi good ordering set_up , and quick delivery only problem was payment was taken twice .
neutral	i received very good service in the shop .
neutral	the assistant was helpful in choosing a new bed for my son .
neutral	delivery of the bed was organised swiftly and it arrived when expected .
neutral	however , the headboard was ordered separately as they didn_'_t have one in stock in the shop .
neutral	the salesman said he expected the headboard to be in on friday and he would phone friday to let_me know .
neutral	nothing happened and due to being busy at work i didn_'_t think of it until about 0_weeks_later when i realised the money had been taken from my credit_card , but no headboard had appeared .
neutral	i telephoned the shop ( why hadn_'_t they phoned me ?)
neutral	and they said it was discontinued in the colour i had ordered .
neutral	i chose an_alternative .
neutral	which was delivered promptly free of charge ..
neutral	the money i was offered wasn_'_t great , i sold 00 cd '_s and got £_00 . 00 !!
neutral	it took well over a week after sending the items for them to be received and the cash to come through , the service was good but i doubt i would use the service again .
neutral	i understand it was my choice to sell the items but in honesty i couldn_'_t be bothered to sell the items individually but it worked out to £ 0 . 00 a cd roughly .... you know they '_ll be sold on for minimum of £ 0 . 00 each , great business .
neutral	very pleased , although i receive e_-_mails stating 00per cent offers and when i order i do not receive the discount ......
neutral	the contact_lenses were a good price but there was a small problem with the order which_meant it took a while to arrive .
neutral	i think it was a stock issue .
neutral	the service was really good but the quality of the product was poor .
neutral	a piece of the mask was detached so i had to glue it back together and it looks like the feathers had been cut as there were loose pieces in the packaging and they were odd in shape .
neutral	no point in contacting company as replacement would not have arrived on time .
neutral	flowers were left on doorstep , and delivery man was in van and driving away when recipient answered the door .
neutral	i received a text saying that my order had been left_securely at the front of the property .
neutral	why did he not wait for an answer and how was it secure ?
neutral	the flowers were up to your usual high_standard .
neutral	i '_m so glad they got to the right person and not to a casual passer_by
neutral	i had a lot of problems trying to use £ 0 voucher given to me for introducing a friend .
neutral	i did an order , although assistant did not seem to know what was going on .
neutral	order never arrived .
neutral	eventually it was sorted_out by a very pleasant employee just a shame i had so much hassel
neutral	ordered blinds , which i thought i paid next_day delivery for .
neutral	turns_out it wasn_'_t and indeed was for am delivery ( costing_£_00 . 00 ).
neutral	oversight on my part and despite placing order within timescales for next_day delivery , customer_services would not budge on making my order for next_day delivery , despite offering to pay the additional_charge and rectify my mistake .
neutral	eventually , after several emails , i was told my am charge was amended and indeed next_day fast track would be put through on the order but would be next working day after ( i ordered thursday and was advised would be delivered monday as being dispatched friday ).
neutral	there was however no surplus charge !
neutral	monday arrived and only 0 of my 0 blinds turned_up !
neutral	emailed customer_services again !
neutral	advised they were sorry for any inconvenience and advised rest of order would be delivered next_day ( tuesday ) - no reason for full order not being dispatched , despite 0 blinds being ordered on the one order !
neutral	disappointing first experience , despite_being suggested by my sister , who have used this company on my occasions .
neutral	customer service i feel could be improved and certainly more detailed responses could be given when a customer emails the team !
neutral	i think that the delivery service is very poor . i waited months for my items ... i ordered in november and still didn_'_t get my cushion for christmas .
neutral	not good , i would not use made again ... sorry .
neutral	i rented a car through rentalcars . com with , as i understood from their website , a full insurance .
neutral	however , at the pick - up i had to pay additional 00_euros to hertz to have everything covered .
neutral	i was quite disappointed with rentalcars . com because of that .
neutral	i typed my registration_number in and it bought up my car .
neutral	i should of checked the tyres but being a ' girl ' i took it as it found my correct car so it would give me the correct tyres .
neutral	i found a really good deal , so good my local tyre place couldn_'_t match it .
neutral	so i drove out of my way to take_advantage of it .
neutral	when i got there , they said i '_d bought the wrong tyres .
neutral	as i am driving on the motorway tomorrow and had limited time , the guy in the garage offered me some tyres that he had in stock .
neutral	i '_ve ended_up with 0 tyres from national_tyre_centre at a normal price with no discount and it definitely wasn_'_t a bargain .
neutral	lower quality tyre for more money .
neutral	:-( i do accept some responsibility for not double_checking the size , but i also feel quite a lot of girls use this service and would trust the registration option .
neutral	i don_'_t think you should offer this service if it doesn_'_t work .
neutral	disappointed with your site and with myself for being such a girl !
neutral	!
neutral	0 . i was not aware a guarantor was needed until l was half way through .
neutral	0 . also ( l understand extra security ) but it turned_out out to be added stress upon the guarantor and the client needing the loan .
neutral	0 .
neutral	perhaps these details could of been in a clearer manner and mentioned earlier on in the application .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the transfer of money from the guarantor account to my account has_been difficult , putting more pressure on her .
neutral	0 .
neutral	all the staff at u . k credit were more than helpful and professional .
neutral	after failing my mot on a cv boot i took my car to two_separate garages to get a quote on replacing as i want able to spend the money they offered on a quote and at both garages i was told no need to pay as it didn_'_t need replacing the clip had come off !
neutral	needless to say last time to this garage !
neutral	booked a long_haul holiday a year in_advance online no_problems .
neutral	with one week to go until departure our tickets had still not arrived .
neutral	contacted customer support who were very polite & helpful who arranged for the tickets to be collected upon departure .
neutral	tickets collected no_problems .
neutral	went to check in desk .
neutral	the man was very polite .
neutral	he said he had a few two - seater sections available & asked if we would like a window seat to which we said yes to both .
neutral	on board the thomas_cook plane we did have two seats in a two - seater section however there was no window , just the wall of the plane .
neutral	the food on the plane was aweful & the tv_channels appeared to be on some sort of loop whereby you had to wait for all the other channels to end before they could be started over again .
neutral	the temperature on board initially was very cold & when i asked for a blanket i was told they had run_out .
neutral	on arrival at our hotel we did not see our thomas_cook rep for a welcome meeting as they were unavailable but we did see a stand in rep . that was the only time we saw any thomas_cook rep which appeared to be a standing joke amongst other guests at the hotel .
neutral	on the flight home we were served the same meal as we '_d been given on the way out ( good job we ate at the airport first ).
neutral	the continental_breakfast , served a few hours prior to landing back in th uk , consisted of just a small blueberry muffin & an orange_juice .
neutral	on holiday itself we had a fantastic time .
neutral	i cannot_fault our hotel or hotel staff .
neutral	they really helped make our holiday .
neutral	all in all i would not fly long_haul with thomas_cook again for the above_reasons .
neutral	maybe if i could fly with a different airline i might think again .
neutral	on a positive_note the thomas_cook staff were always polite & did their best to help .
neutral	i was charged_£ 0 . 00 for delivery on goods which should have been free delivery .
neutral	you have to ' select ' the free delivery option the site doesn_'_t do this automatically !
neutral	i complained and the charge was refunded .
neutral	other than that excellent prompt service .
neutral	a . o com where spot_on with delivery and communications for delivery but i felt they let themselves down by not replying to me when i e_- mailed them telling them there was 0 small dents at the front of my hotpoint freezer ..... poor customer service
neutral	furniture is lovely but unfortunately few problems with my order some parts damage / marks
neutral	took pics sent email also telephoned to speak to customer service advisor who said get phone_call saturday or monday which didn_'_t happen so that '_s not good
neutral	i telephoned today and a technician arranged for few_days to assess goods
neutral	overall goods well_packaged to must be problem before packaging also delivery was on time
neutral	the furniture is lovely and good value for money .
neutral	told the delivery slot in plenty of time and appreciated the phone_call 00_minutes beforehand however how on earth you are supposed to unpack the furniture from the boxes without_damaging the box ( box must be kept in_tact to return any faulty items if not guarantee void ).
neutral	obviously you can '_t lift the item of furniture out of the box because of weight .
neutral	my other problem was the two pieces of wood screwed ( 0 x 0 . 0 inch screws ) into the bottom of the desk to stop any movement .
neutral	you had to turn the very heavy desk upside_down to access the wood , the screws had obviously not been put in by hand and were very difficult to undo .
neutral	you then had to turn the desk back upright .
neutral	only after i completed the order and checked the status of it did it say that my order will arrive anytime_between_0am and 0pm with a caveat that it may even be later because it was valentines_day .
neutral	my order was to be delivered to a school so obviously i wanted to make_sure it arrived before it closed .
neutral	i emailed the company and asked if there was anything they could do to ensure delivery before school kicked out .
neutral	i got a fairly quick and curt reply informing_me that there was nothing they could do .
neutral	i emailed back , somewhat miffed , saying that i couldn_'_t_believe a company that makes its living from deliveries for special_occasions could be so remiss as to leave something like whether the intended_recipient does indeed receive the order to complete chance .
neutral	again they replied quickly saying they would speak to the couriers for me .
neutral	bingo !
neutral	that '_s all i wanted in the first place and luckily , be it from what was said or quite by_chance , it was delivered in time .
neutral	sort it out serenata !
neutral	!
neutral	the flowers i sent were nice but they were not the freshest of flowers they looks a little old and used .
neutral	i know they were oly £_00 . 00 but still :(
neutral	asked for flowers to be left with neighbour if no one in but instead simply but a card through door and put them over the wall into back garden where the dog was and could have destroyed them .
neutral	i ordered a steam - generator_iron online .
neutral	it arrived satisfactorily .
neutral	however , it didn_'_t work .
neutral	i phoned go - electrical .
neutral	a woman answered the phone but , bizarrely , said she couldn_'_t speak on the phone !
neutral	i must put my complaint in writing .
neutral	when i said that wasn_'_t acceptable she said petulantly that no other customer minded ( a comment not likely to pacify the customer ).
neutral	it was difficult to arrange a new delivery and swap - over of irons but we arranged a monday .
neutral	no - one came , no - one told me they weren_'_t coming , i had to phone g - e .
neutral	they were sorry but their carrier had let them down .
neutral	they needed to re - arrange .
neutral	the trouble is that carriers dictate the delivery rules ; you have to free up a whole day , from 0 to 0 .
neutral	you ' re asked if a neighbour can deal with it and , when you say no , you ' re made to feel as if you ' re being difficult .
neutral	i can '_t be the only one who at this point becomes upset and somewhat aggressive .
neutral	the carrier lets you know on the day by email by 0am which specific time_slot you have been allotted .
neutral	this means i had to get up early , although i '_d had a very late night , in order to come downstairs , switch on the computer , get through to my emails , in order in this case to find the carrier was not coming till lunchtime !
neutral	why on earth can '_t the carrier , or the company , notify one by phone or text ?
neutral	why on earth can '_t customer_services provide a phone service to the customer , especially as they are on the phone !
neutral	that said , g - e had run_out of the iron i '_d ordered and replaced it with a better model , which is brilliant , so thank them for that .
neutral	further , the women i spoke to were , overall , very pleasant and clear .
neutral	however , the icing alone is no substitute for the cake !
neutral	the service needs serious overhauling , including liaising better with the carrier , or changing the carrier , or bringing a carrier in - house .
neutral	the poor delivery man who brought the second iron had never been on the route before , had been given no map , not been allowed to pack his van himself so didn_'_t know where anything was and , at the time he got to me , had had to miss out 00 people as he had not been allowed enough time to sort himself out .
neutral	as a general point , i am sick of companies sub - contracting and then bleating when they lose control of their sub - contractors .
neutral	the responsibility lies with the seller , not the carrier .
neutral	kept well informed on order and delivery but had to tell recipient to check front of house in evening , where she found them unprotected on the doorstep .
neutral	i was advised of delivery at 0 . 00pm , shame a card wasn_'_t popped thro letterbox advising where left
neutral	please see above
neutral	i found the site easy to use and access the best rate of mexican peso '_s .
neutral	ordered through travel_fx 00 / 0 and paid travel_fx with an expected arrival date of 00 feb_0000 , plenty of time allowed for transaction .
neutral	was very pleased with the compare the market however what a shame the affilated parties used by compare holiday money failed to communicate , deliver on time and didn_'_t deliver the expected level of customer service , very different experience to the level of service from compare the market
neutral	my first order arrived .
neutral	returned 0 bulbs out of the 0 and i am still_waiting for them to be delivered .
neutral	i also had to pay £ 0 . 00 to the royal_mail for the delivery . this is now the 00 / 0 /_0000 .
neutral	good company for trampolines and products that go with it .
neutral	only don_'_t like is you can '_t pay online using normal methods to pay unless you open a google account very annoying .
neutral	products arrived on time and received email to say on their way which is useful .
neutral	i made my order 00 . 00 . 00 .
neutral	i haven_'_t got it still !
neutral	i made order in frownies . co . uk 00 . 00 . 00 and have got my order 00 . 00 . 00 .
neutral	find the emails helpful to keep_up to date on latest deals .
neutral	i '_ve not booked anything as try do can '_t comment further - but so far do good with useful info !
neutral	the products i ordered were fine and the service was good but my free ' sleep in rollers ' were meant to be worth £_00 and i can '_t understand this as it was only 00 rollers , a brush and some hairspray .
neutral	the confusion is mainly_because i know that a set of 00 rollers is retails between £_00 to £_00 and the hairspray and brush are not worth that much .
neutral	was disappointed because ill have to buy another set of rollers anyway .
neutral	online ordering was straightforward .
neutral	i needed to follow_up the order with a phone_call and the person was very helpful - when i finally_managed to get through .
neutral	the delivery arrived exactly on time , but i had previously been sent two texts_advising delivery of two completely_different items , so was rather anxious_about what would actually turn_up .
neutral	the men were grumpy and unhelpful and i have made a formal_complaint about them .
neutral	ordered a comfy collar for my puppy in preparation for his neutering surgery .
neutral	easy website to use and product arrived the next_day which was great .
neutral	however the collar did not prevent him from licking or trying to bite his surgery wound and he could easily reach the area rendering the product useless and a waste of money unfortunately .
neutral	i ordered two items one of which was needed within 0 / 0_days .
neutral	a second item was not available but order witheld thus delaying important item .
neutral	much to slow in telling_me about this hence a very disappointing and unnecessary delay .
neutral	got an_email through confirming my order details and tracking_info - wasnt able to access tracking_details so no clue of parcel progress .
neutral	same seems to be the case on week 0 .
neutral	delivery came on right day and was well_packaged and seemed fresh .
neutral	first delivery of irish rump_steak was disappointing .
neutral	looked lovely out of the pack but when cooked ( to medium ) meat was pretty tough , not especially flavoursome and was full of grissle .
neutral	selection was a good price on an offer but not sure i would be happy to pay full price .
neutral	giving the hamper a second chance this week but suspect i will be cancelling after that .
neutral	i ordered the roses and stocks bouquet for my mother in laws_00th_birthday , online the roses looked pale_pink and the stocks an assortment of purples .
neutral	i paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to upgrade the bouquet to deluxe .
neutral	i had them delivered on thursday which was her_birthday , when i went to her house on the sunday i was sad to see that the bouquet was very wilted and almost dead .
neutral	the bouquet was also very small for the price and to say i paid_extra for a bigger bouquet .
neutral	the flowers were also not as colourful as online .
neutral	the roses were plain_white and the stocks were all the same purple which i found quite plain .
neutral	this was a complete let_down for me as i had ordered a bouquet the week before for my friend and they were beautiful .
neutral	i bought blinds on two occasions and am happy with the quality .
neutral	the delivery seriously lets them down .
neutral	no tracking of parcels and i had to contact them on numerous_occasions to chase the blinds as only half the set was delivered .
neutral	if you could track them or at_least know the day they are due that would improve the service and they would get 0_stars .
neutral	ordered a number if items making delivery cost worthwhile only to find out that one of the items was not available even after i had purchased and had confirmation of my order .
neutral	the bits that did arrive were beautifully_packaged and very good quality , unfortunately the items didn_'_t go with the cut of my dress so returned items which was simple and hassle_free .
neutral	would have been 0_stars if website stock had been up to date so i knew before ordering it wasn_'_t available !
neutral	i have to say that the wardrobe i bought looks as it was worth twice the money .
neutral	great service up to the point of delivery .
neutral	however , the instructions to assemble the wardrobe were very , very poor .
neutral	just lazy to have such crappy instructions as it would take very little time to make good instructions .
neutral	i renovate properties for a living , and have all the tools etc as well as lot of experience assembling flat packs .
neutral	i would say the wardrobe took me 0 hours to assemble by myself .
positive	everything organised in the time frames i requested and accommodation alternatives offered - some we took and others we organised ourselves .
positive	i could never have arranged this trip myself and was very pleased with the service and the price .
positive	gordon kept in touch throughout and was very helpful .
positive	flight_centre was recommended to me by a friend and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them .
positive	kate
positive	j ' ai_reçu mes articles très_bien emballés ( c ' était fragile ) pas_de casse , rapidement .
positive	les_prix pratiqués sont les moins chers sur_le net .
positive	très_bien , à_recommander

positive	je_commande régulièrement sur northern_parrot , et_j ' en suis très_satisfaite .
positive	this is the first time i have used marks_electrical and i will have no_hesitation in using them again .
positive	the service was excellent from_start to finish .
positive	although the dish_washer i purchased wasn_'_t in stock , one was immediately ordered from the manufacturers and delivered to marks the next_day .
positive	two_days_later it was delivered to me .
positive	every_step of the way i was informed of it '_s progress through texts and emails .
positive	the price was competitive and delivery free .
positive	a very efficient company and thanks to cristian who dealt_with my order , he couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
positive	i ordered a whisky jug and small bottle of whisky to match , the order came unbelievably fast and packaged with care so there was no chance of breakages occurring !
positive	i cannot_rate this firm highly_enough for service and products at a rate that is very reasonable !
positive	keep_up the good work !
positive	good service , good quality !
positive	i was delighted with the ease of ordering and the speed of acknowledgement and delivery .
positive	my order came quickly good quality masks should have a right laugh at street party
positive	they were very quick with delivery , i did have a few arrive damaged which they replaced free of charge , would recommend , this is my 0nd year using them and will_continue to do so .
positive	after_searching the net for a kids north_face coat i '_d seen i stumbled_across this company with the same cost at a cheaper price .
positive	brilliant prices , fabulous customer service !
positive	!
positive	i have bought many many orders from shc and have found excellent products , a very fast and reliable delivery service and extremely fair postage_costs .
positive	customer service is second to none and if i ever have a question i get immediate_responses .
positive	shc rates in my top 0 suppliers in the uk and my top 00 internationally .
positive	quick delivery and great products
positive	the products i bought from you are very good , especially the glasses as i will be using them cold puddings as well as drinking .

positive	hi i have purchased items numerous_times and are very happy with the service and would recommend u try them
positive	i was really pleased to have made significant_savings by purchasing a popular cologne for my son '_s birthday from cheapsmells .
positive	everywhere_else on line was very similarly priced at £_00 . 00 more .
positive	what '_s more the cologne was delivered in the time frame stated .
positive	my son was also happy as he got the cologne that he_likes , and had a bit extra spent on his other presents .
positive	i will definitely check out cheapsmells first next time .
positive	searched several different websites for airport_parking and this was by far the cheapest - recommended .

positive	and sikkim and darjeeling .
positive	for these i '_ve worked on my slides and with the
positive	help of a digital scanner i have transferred them to the pc .
positive	00 years_ago i was giving talks and i felt i wanted a record of our adventures .
positive	with the advent of digital_cameras , i have been enabled to print from images
positive	straight from the camera .
positive	the latest book was langtang in nepal .
positive	i chose pictures i thought
positive	would ' work '.
positive	i was very disappointed with the results - the photos being very
positive	dark .
positive	when i sent the books back - i was helped to understand the use of ' aids '
positive	to light the images and to use the ' sunny smile '!
positive	the result was a much_better book , which i was pleased with .

positive	we stayed in villa kaleon in puerto_del carmen .
positive	it was fantastic !
positive	very close to all the shops , bars and restaurants etc .
positive	0 comfortable bedrooms with comfortable_beds and air_con ( which is a must for a good nights_sleep ) great kitchen with everything you could need , and a comfortable living_area .
positive	if you have children of any age , they won_'_t get_bored .
positive	wifi so they can use their phones / tablets / laptops etc .
positive	outside a ping_pong table and pool_table which we all loved .
positive	then the pool - it isn_'_t very big , but it was big enough for us .
positive	with it being small though , it means the pool heater worked very well .
positive	even_though it was very hot when we were in lanzarote , i hate going into a freezing pool !
positive	but this was like a warm bath .
positive	it would be great for small children or babies .
positive	the fact that it was only about 0 feet in depth was excellent i thought too .
positive	the villa looks on the pics as if it might be overlooked , but it isn_'_t really .
positive	you can see the back of the villa next door , but you don_'_t see the residents very often .
positive	the only problem we had with the area is that it seems as if most of it is residential .
positive	there are some barking dogs , and across the street one of the residents locks her dogs outside , and they bark alot until about midnight .
positive	this might be a problem if you have younger_children who are in bed earlier_than this .
positive	the villa_plus staff that we came_across were all lovley and very helpful .
positive	we only had one problem when an electical awning came down on it '_s own and wouldn_'_t go back .
positive	contact with the villa_plus staff was very easy , and it was soon sorted_out .
positive	loved it and want to go back now !!

positive	thank_you
positive	i was very hesitant_about buying battery lights because i felt that they might be one of those things that are great in theory but rubbish in practice .
positive	not so !!
positive	i have had them up for 0_days now and they look amazing .
positive	they are robust , well made and i especially like the fact that each light has a little plastic hook that can latch onto branches etc to keep the lights in place .
positive	when lit , the lights look beautiful and are every bit as bright as mains powered lights - maybe even brighter - and the tiner function is great because i haven_'_t got to remember to turn them on and off .
positive	and of course , you can have the lights anywhere without having to worry_about a power_supply .
positive	they were also delivered ahead of time .
positive	my only very slight gripe is that it would have been nice to have some instructions and spec details to cover things like timer function , bulb replacement etc - the lights the only_thing in the box .
positive	proper impressed
positive	jules_b is a great online site .
positive	easy to navigate and find what i was after .

positive	as i don_'_t live very near to a main town , access to main brands and new brands isn_'_t that easy .
positive	this is a great site , with lots of well_known_brands and some i hadn_'_t heard of before .
positive	what i ordered arrived quicker_than the predicted date and was reasonable_price .

positive	best service i have received in a long time .
positive	i '_ll be ordering more products from this company !
positive	!
positive	i purchased sumatra wall panels early this year , it was the first time that i have used wet wall and used these as they appeared value for money and better made than competitiors .
positive	the panels and shower kit arrived promptly .
positive	they are easy to cut with a handsaw , for the shower kit i preset the corner into the wall , this was a mistake and in future i would fit both corner panels and the corner moulding in one go , before the glue sets .
positive	the panels are fairly large 0000 by 0000 and really need two people to fit .
positive	the completed job looks great .
positive	the only product i was not happy with was the adhesive , i have used stuff like " no nails " which grabs quickly and holds well , the supplied adhesive requires a long time to grab , although the weight of the panel does not help , probably some kind of support or angle jack would help .
positive	the level of communication about the status of my order was amazing .
positive	at every_step of the order i received either a text or email and this left me in no_doubt that the order was being fulfilled .
positive	the flowers were amazing - so much so that the recipient posted a picture of them on facebook , thank_you .
positive	absolutely_stunning service from an internet company .

positive	service could not be quicker and communication was accessible , appropriate and timely .
positive	all in all - excellent
positive	product was as_described with the sizing true to what was expected .
positive	dress itself with headband and choker were good but i gave the ' boots ' a miss !
positive	( even with white shoes / boots underneath these ' covers ' would have looked ' tacky ' and spoilt the look of the outfit - i chose to wear my own cream suede boots which looked just as good .)
positive	i was very happy with service i received goods arrived on time , i have no_complaints and i would recommend any of my friends to use your company
positive	ordered 0 wigs and 0 silk shirt for a 00 '_s night and was impressed with the quality and the speed that the good came ......... also the size was correct ........ usually at_least one of these doesn_'_t come up to expectation but all three did ...... well_done would use you again also let friends and family know about your website .

positive	i had my doubts_about spending that lil bit extra on my 00s dress but this one is ideal !
positive	usually u find sizes can be a bit odd so naturally i bought the bigger_size however had to return it for being too_big !
positive	and as iv just had a baby this was quite a compliment :) anyway the returns was easy and simple and when i ordered the next size down it was super quick even with the two foot of snow weve had !
positive	i was expecting it in a few_days and it came the next_day !
positive	i had gone to our local fancy_dress shop and got a cheap and cheerful dress but it did nothing for me , but after trying this on it is so flattering and i can feel_confident not thinking_about my bit of a baby belly :) will be wearing it this weekend for my birthday and i cant_wait !

positive	the service was easy , delivery prompt and made the whole buying business easy .
positive	we ordered the samsung clp 000 colour laser_printer .
positive	the service from printerland was excellent , the printer was delivered the next working day .
positive	to sum up they have a good website and offered great service .
positive	so far the samsung laser_printer ordered seems good .
positive	excellent printing speed and excellent quality printing .
positive	the only_negative_point is the alarming speed at which we used up the toners supplied with the printer .
positive	we are now ordering the high capacity cartridges and will see how long they last
positive	only had a small order but it arrived as ordered and all good .
positive	thank_you .
positive	dispatched very quickly .

positive	i couldn_'_t have asked for more .
positive	would definitely use again and reccomend to others .
positive	i first discovered titmuss with our last dog and so when we got our new_puppy i automatically came back for food and dog accessories .
positive	the prices and service are second to none .
positive	it '_s nice to be back !
positive	lovely range of home wear , at reasonable_prices and comparable to what you would pay in the more premium end of department_stores , but more choice .
positive	i was given a realistic delivery time and in the end was delivered earlier_than this ,
positive	now that there are so many flea_treatments containing fiprobil , it can be bewildering to choose the most cost_effective .
positive	i was therefore delighted to find beeston_animal_health limited selling a six pack for less_than £_00 with free delivery .
positive	the firpronil content is the same as frontline , so with three cats to treat this is an obvious choice .
positive	delivery was quick so , so top_marks all_round .

positive	i don_'_t go_anywhere_else .
positive	after making an online enquiry someone contacted me the next_day and put me in touch with a solicitor straight_away , couldn_'_t have been easier .
positive	i found alwaysriding through a google_search when looking for a merino_wool biking jersey and i was pleasantly_surprised to find out that not only did they offer the jersey at a lower price but they also offered free shipping !
positive	because my shipping and billing addresses were different , they followed up personally to make_sure that someone wasn_'_t trying to scam my card and they were very prompt in responding that all was well and they would be sending out the garment shortly .
positive	a great customer service experience overall and i love my vulpine merino_wool jersey !

positive	a couple of days_later i rang lee again to ask about a sub - woofer , i could not afford the matching focal sub so asked lee for advice on alternatives .
positive	he made some calls and got back to me with a price on the focal cms sub woofer which was £_000 less_than everyone else .

positive	i bought a size small joggers ( i am a 00 ) and a medium zipped hoodie as i don_'_t like things too restricting .

positive	i love the shoes i got , they are so comfortable and they came within 0_days .
positive	i am delighted .
positive	the rope lights were bought to be installed along out yard walls , the order only comes with one pack of clips , so you need to by a few more .
positive	we very quickly discovered the clips that were included , snap very easily when you attach the lights to them .
positive	the clips sold separately are far more robust .
positive	the lights are great , we bought them for a house party initially , everyone loved them .
positive	they just finished the yard up just nice .
positive	it looked like we could have been abroad , if only we have better weather !
positive	i recommend the rope lights .
positive	great purchase .
positive	superb quality and value and prompt emails replying to query as to delivery time .
positive	would have paid double in the big stores .
positive	thank_you
positive	so fast posted tue cash in bank by thurs
positive	i was looking for a replacement chin vent for my arai helmet - there were none of the size & colour i needed in stock at the time but the price made it worthwhile to wait .
positive	i had excellent communication_throughout and would certainly consider_using this company again .
positive	saved as a favourite bookmark !
positive	!
positive	cant beleive_how great a service i just received turnaround from_start to finish 0_days thanks
positive	we loved our order with optimalprint !

positive	the delivery was quicker_than we expected too .
positive	i highly_recommend this service .
positive	i ordered some trial glasses which were sent and returned quickly and without_fuss !
positive	i only liked one pair of the ones i trialled so i took a risk on the second_pair .
positive	both are brilliant , in fact the second_pair is my favourite !

positive	great value , outstanding workmanship , a beautiful piece of furniture . i will absolutely be using oak_furnitureland in the future . well_done !
positive	just requested a call off them as working nights , and unlike another online provider , who didn_'_t bother to ring at all , they rang , sorted my 0 booking , put it all on one transaction no credit_card charge !!!!!
positive	& still a 0 %_discount for repeat customer , so many on line booking places try to get every last penny out of you piling on credit_card charges , some even charge for debit_cards , that in my opinion is a disgrace .
positive	i will not go_anywhere_else now .
positive	i booked with alpharooms 0 years running , they cant be_beaten on price , straight_forward booking on their websight , and service . i have booked again with them for october this year .
positive	lovely quality worktops .

positive	i am very pleased with the service as my perfume is not one of the more popular ones and therefore is not available in the stores near me .
positive	the price was very competitive , too .
positive	all_round , an excellent service which i would recommend to anyone .
positive	feedem is the only place i can buy a specific product i need for my dogs which i can '_t get locally any more .
positive	their service is reliable and very good and their product range is excellent .
positive	only draw_back is the postage which is very high because they generally use a courier .
positive	if they used my hermes it would be cheaper !
positive	also they don_'_t have a loyalty_scheme which if you are a regular customer could make such a difference .
positive	pharmacy0u is a great service for people too busy to collect a prescription and get it from a chemist .
positive	everything is done for the customer - all you have to do is put in an on line request and without_any fuss the medications arrive at your door within a day usually .
positive	only problem is having to be in to sign for it otherwise its a trip to the depot but that '_s down to royal_mail !
positive	if there is a problem or i have a query , pharmacy0u phone immediately and the staff are always very helpful , kind and courteous .
positive	i rely_on pharmacy0u for my daily medications and i would no go elsewhere - they have been totally brilliant and have never let_me down once - you can '_t say that about many companies !

positive	i have made two purchases to date ; one for a couple of bottles of gin and another for a gift bottle of champagne .
positive	the selection on offer is good with some more specialist bottles of gin available .
positive	the ' discounts ' i saw , of approximately_£ 0 - 0 . 00 on some bottles , makes you wonder_why they bother but it all helps by the time you pay for delivery .

positive	i then ordered the tyres online ( which was incredibly easy - and cheaper ).

positive	and completed the job efficiently , without_any fuss for me !

positive	silent , wash well , easy to instal , not a bad look too ... so what more could i ask ?
positive	until now ( 0 week of use ) i have no cons .
positive	i did not know this brand ( it '_s not a famous brand in france ) but it seems it '_s a good one for less money than some famous_brands .
positive	nb_: if you instal it by yourself , do not forget to remove the security bolts behind the wasmachine or you could damage it .
positive	it '_s a bit_tricky .
positive	you will have to be with someone_who will keep the drum up while you will have to unscrew .
positive	service : perfect .
positive	i was a bit_worried to order a machine through a site i found by_accident .
positive	if i dared to do that it '_s due their complete specifications about their machines ( you even have videos ). and also all things are very clear ( delivery , price etc ...).
positive	your order placed , you will reveice a mail but also they will call you to check if eveything is right .
positive	i liked that .
positive	as i am a friend of environment ( and i could do that this time ), i chose the eco delivery ( it '_s the day when they are in your area ). only 0_days to wait so ...
positive	the time_slot is 0 am - 0 pm .
positive	but not only you can track with a number on their site , the arrival '_s time and have more details but also at 0 am i got a call from a machine telling_me they would be here before 00 am .
positive	the team itself called me 00_minutes before .
positive	they were on time according to what they told me , delivered a very well_packaged and protected machine without_damaging something , were very polite , ... well in a nutshell : professionnal delivery service and team .
positive	good morning ,
positive	i received my parcel quickly and all was what i ordered and in good conditions .
positive	the only point i could say is about the tracking_number .
positive	i got a mail saying i will receive a new mail with my tracking_number as soon as it will be in dispatched status .
positive	having received nothing , on saturday i went outside .
positive	i was coming_back to home and then i saw the yodel van .
positive	so i stopped it :).
positive	the man was very nice , coming_back to my home for giving my parcel .
positive	it is just a small dysfunction and i am not bothered with it .
positive	but some people are very quick to jump on every detail to complain .
positive	so i thought it is better to give the information to your services .
positive	on my side , dune and steppe ( my gerbils ) and i thank to all of you for your professional behaviour .
positive	have a nice day .

positive	on the whole , excellent service .
positive	i emailed my order and it was delivered the next_day , great service and at a very good price .
positive	i '_m based in cardiff and didn_'_t really fancy the long drive to birmingham but couldn_'_t get to see the machines i was interested in closer to home .
positive	i emailed to check_availability and planned a visit , but as is always the case , once you start looking at machines your spec changes , your price bracket changes etc .
positive	and so i sent a lot of confusing emails asking to see very different machines .
positive	after a quick conversation with gur i had explained my needs , and my confusion and was steered back on track .
positive	they suggested seeing a janome on a very good offer , to see if it met my needs , and if not advised me to look at a pfaff machine advising that people either take to it quickly or can '_t get on with it .
positive	when i arrived i looked at and tested about five machines .
positive	at no point was i made to feel like my time was up , or that i had seen my quota of machines and couldn_'_t look at anymore , or that i must buy a machine then and there .
positive	in fact the staff knew how far i had travelled and were very welcoming .
positive	i was allowed to test the machines and run comparisons of stitches seeing how neat the lettering was and how precise the decorative stitches were .
positive	some makes were thrown out of running straightaway ( for my particular needs ) and i was glad to have advice saying if this is important to you consider this make , if you want something_else look at these machines .
positive	i had been to closer shops who were very helpful but only stocked a couple of makes .
positive	i am very happy with my purchase , and the excellent extended guarantees offered by gur .
positive	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to visit when looking for a new machine as they can be expensive purchases and you need to be sure you are buying something compatible with you .
positive	a very straight_forward , easy to navigate web_site .
positive	excellent response via chat box after i ordered the wrong amount of tyres .
positive	a very polite , efficient chap sorted it and refunded .

positive	really good service on availability and delivery . prices beat a well_known high_street retailer hands_down . wouldnt go_anywhere_else for my vitamins .
positive	good company to deal with .
positive	the website was clear and ordering simple .
positive	the helmet we ordered was well priced and dispatched within a reasonable time_scale and received in perfect_condition .
positive	our only_criticism would be in regard to the tracking_information offered by the delivery partner .
positive	they intimated that a time_slot would be available on the morning of delivery but in fact it was nearer lunchtime before we were informed that the delivery would take place between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 - but that time we '_d already stayed in half the day !
positive	still even_though it was not perfect it was helpful when notification eventually came through .

positive	spigen . cases are superb
positive	our dog has barked on meeting other dogs since he was a puppy .
positive	we tried an electric shock collar , but found it very bulky for him to wear .
positive	just recently we decided to try the clix anti bark collar , which is much smaller & less obtrusive .
positive	he now wears it on most walks , but we only switch it on if we meet another dog .
positive	the vibrating mode works almost_instantly - we tend not to use the high pitch noise , as we don ; t want to annoy our other dog , who thankfully is not a barker !
positive	ordering was easy & items received quickly .
positive	no_problems from_start to finish .
positive	would use this company again & recommend them to other dog / cat owners .

positive	i have been buying from crocus for some years_now , i have read some of the other more negative_reviews and can '_t_believe this is the same company !
positive	i have never had a problem with crocus customer service , i have had about three bad plants , one broken , one died , one never showed itself as it should have done come spring , in every instance crocus either replaced the plant or refunded the money without_any fuss at all .

positive	with my fencing i received the nails and a pot of jackure which is used to treat the places where cutting or drilling is necessary , using this also keeps up your 00 year_guarantee !
positive	i have to say i was really impressed with the quality of the fencing and i know a lot of my neighbours admire it , i installed it as soon as it was delivered and because it is pre treated with jackure i have never had to treat it since .

positive	).
positive	the sideboard was delivered on the friday after a phonecall and a text from the delivery team the day before and that morning to advise the exact time . the furniture is great , looks good , fantastic value for money and in my opinion we would not have received better service if we had shopped in harrods . i don_'_t know how other customers have found the service but we would certainly shop there again and would have no_hesitation in recommending this company to anyone , certainly the milton_keynes branch .
positive	.

positive	i bought a large bean_bag and childs size bean_bag for christmas for my two sons from beanbagbazaar .
positive	i did spend quite a while pondering which sizes to go for .
positive	as my younger son is a small ten year_old i decided on the child size one for him , which to be fair is not a bad size but i think really a larger one would have been better .
positive	but they are really good and a great price too .
positive	we all want one .... there is a fight over who is going to sit on them because they are so comfy !
positive	so i think i will have to buy another couple !
positive	great beanbags , strong fabric , easy site to navigate , good prices , delivery was fast too .

positive	!
positive	have used partyrama before and will use again .

positive	customer service is also good , though once booked , the hard_work is being done by the company you book with .
positive	we stayed at the kresten royal at rhodes for a week in early june_0000 and had a fab time .
positive	the hotel is very nice , it has have 0 swimming pools , both with bars .
positive	one of them only serves drinks , the other serves food as well .
positive	the one nearer the sea is large and has varying depth , the smaller one nearer the reception is about 0 . 0m deep all around .
positive	both have crystal_clear waters .
positive	we stayed in a superior sea - view room , which was very large , very spacious , big balcony too .
positive	comfy bed , the bath had jacuzzi in it with quite powerful jets as well .
positive	we had the ' all_inclusive ' deal , which was really worth it .
positive	it really means all_inclusive , drinks as well ( perhaps not alcohol , but we don_’_t drink alcohol anyway ), and hot food is served in one restaurant or another almost all day long .
positive	the hotel has 0 restaurants , the main one always serves buffet style food with wide and varied_selection .
positive	i actually prefer this style as_opposed to having to sit_down and wait to be served .
positive	there is an italian_restaurant and a greek one as well .
positive	in the ' all_inclusive ' deal you can opt to go one evening to the italian and one evening to the greek for ‘ free ’.
positive	the hotel does not have a sandy beach , but it does have a little cove where they put out sun_beds and there is a changing cubicle .
positive	otherwise there is an area cut through the rocks that leads to flat rocks where you can jump into the sea safely .
positive	again sunbeds were provided here as well .
positive	as i am a keen snorkeler , i find rocks and some wild life more interesting than a flat sandy beach so i was happy with this .
positive	the holiday rep , mark , was very friendly and knowledgeable , nothing was too much_trouble .
positive	the staff was also friendly , especially agnieszka at reception , who was very helpful .
positive	again , nothing was too much_trouble .
positive	the hotel is near rhodes town , only 00_minutes on public_transport .
positive	well_worth the visit .
positive	few things that could perhaps be improved_upon :
positive	0 .
positive	no wi_-_fi in the room , but there is ethernet .
positive	fortunately i always have an ethernet cable with me when i travel .
positive	0 .
positive	the large , spacious_rooms were quite sparse , a bit soulless and they also echoed a lot .
positive	perhaps some rugs , maybe pictures or something ….
positive	0 .
positive	for some reason you do not get foam bath or bath salts , only shower_gel and shampoo .
positive	bit surprising for a 0_star hotel .
positive	0 .
positive	tv was pretty small for the size of the room and the sounds was so faint that we could hardly hear it .
positive	you get only cnn and bbc world news in english .
positive	not a huge issue … one does not go on holiday to a sun - drenched country to watch tv .
positive	having said all that , we had a really good time , enjoyed it very much .
positive	the points above did not bother us at all .
positive	we can thoroughly_recommend the place .
positive	i was worried_about something and asked a question via the web_site .
positive	i received a prompt and courteous response , but also pointing it out that the answer was on the web_site .
positive	it must be boring / annoying for them to have to respond to questions that have answers in their faq .
positive	still , they were polite :-) .
positive	my order arrived in record_time .
positive	great fun .
positive	reasonable_prices , smooth_transaction .
positive	no_issues .
positive	i bought it for a more_expensive hansgrohe shower_head set as they discontinued this line ( and the one i did find that may have fitted were very expensive ).
positive	the tube diameter was 00mm , so i thought i '_ll chance it .
positive	at this price , even if it did not , it would not have been too bad .
positive	but it did fit after a little fiddling and was very snug .
positive	it would not be much good if you frequently needed to adjust the shower_head up or down , but if it can stay mainly in one position , it '_s perfect .
positive	the site is easy to use , and ordering is simple .
positive	delivery was prompt ( again ), and the best part of all - the bilberry and lutein tablets work !
positive	my vision is noticeably clearer - i had a nice_surprise at the eye clinic .
positive	everything you could want for a fancy_dress_party for all ages plus fast delivery , will use this site in the future
positive	once found the door was easy to collect items ( could do with an obvious sign to say ring the bell near the collection door )
positive	this game is excellent , my class of 0 year_olds absolutely love it .
positive	they have played with all three dice from the very start as they said they like a challenge .
positive	would definitely recommend it to all primary_school teachers .
positive	so chuffed with my recent_purchase from the pole company .
positive	extremely pleased with the level of detail paid prior to my order being confirmed .
positive	i placed a bespoke order & will be placing another in the very near_future .
positive	easy service to use and cheaper_than the post_office for larger items

positive	many_thanks .
positive	the website was easy to follow and offered a variety of choice .
positive	the wedding_invitations that i chose were of a simple elegance that on delivery exceeded my expectations .
positive	the packaging of the invitations was done with great care and a degree of romance , as they were wrapped in layers of pink & white tissue , protected with a gold seal .
positive	excellent service that i can_honestly_say exceeded my expectations .

positive	excellent service ordered on wednesday_afternoon and delivered on friday_morning .
positive	we purchased the veloped recently for my husband who_suffers from progressive neuropathy meaning that he cannot walk unaided as he has no balance .
positive	a walking_stick was affecting one hip and he still needed to hold my hand with his other hand .
positive	we tried a four wheeled rollator which was fine in the house and in town where it was smooth but useless elsewhere and had to be lifted over kerbs and door threshholds , not the best for someone without balance .
positive	as we live on a farm it still left him unable to get any essential exercise .
positive	the veloped is very sturdy and inspires confidence , it is larger than a four wheel rollator but you do not feel it will tip forward and feels much more stable .
positive	it has very innovative design features , wheel removal , handle bar adjustment and folding mechanism are just one click operations .
positive	the dual front_wheel is easily altered from the kerb and doorstep climbing position to country walking where both wheels travel on the ground reducing wheel wander .

positive	i am glad to report that i had absolutely no_problems at all with ordering , payment or delivery - which was swift and on - time .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in using easyanimal again , or in recommending them to others .
positive	i have used viovet on three or four occasions over the last_year and will happily continue to do so .
positive	orders are easy to place and delivered quickly and they keep you informed by email with each_step of the process .
positive	they also have an optional handy ' reminder ' service which you can set to your requirements and subscribe to .
positive	i would have no_hesitation in recommending viovet .
positive	have used dapw on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed with their service or the quality of their goods .
positive	most_recent_purchase was an absolutely_beautiful mulberry_silk throw in taupe .
positive	i was wary of ordering without knowing the actual measurements of this item - but the blanket is a good large size and lovely quality .
positive	in fact , i have ordered two more !
positive	i have also ' invested ' in some of their ultimate 0000 thread_count bed_linen - yes , a bit_pricey , compared to other options - but absolutely worth the outlay for such fine quality cotton .
positive	now i am saving up for some of their goose_down pillows !
positive	i cannot_fault this company !
positive	the website is colourful and easy to use .
positive	a wide_range of goods and of very good quality .

positive	i found winstanleys_pramworld via the search_engine and found the item i required as a pre order ... great !
positive	but first i emailed them to confirm the delivered to jersey .
positive	i received a response from rhianna within hours and she was extremely_helpful , even telling_me how to ensure the vat is deducted from the items for ci residents .
positive	i then sent a second email as i had forgot to ask when they would be expecting the pre order item in .
positive	.... again , a response within the hr fro .
positive	rhianna stating 0 - 00 days .
positive	i preordered the item late on tues 0th_july .... only for the courier to be knocking at my door at 0am on the monday .... bearing in . ins we live in jersey and that the item should have been on pre order , i find this exceptional .
positive	the item was as_described and the paper_work which came with the item whereby numerous check had been carried_out on my order before dispatching from winstanley gave a sense of professionalism and care had gone into making_sure my order was correct .
positive	i will certainly be spreading the word over in jersey and i am already sharing their facebook_page .
positive	the only_thing i would like to see is that possibly finding a way of lowering the courier charge for small items .
positive	for instance , a parasol is selling for £_00 but the delivery costs of £_00 ... i can understand the cost for larger items but if they could find a way of charging a smaller fee for smaller items that would be fantastic and wouldn_'_t put people off .
positive	overall , i highley_recommend this quality business .

positive	mitt sista köp av blommor via euroflorist var imponerande .
positive	buketten var beställd till att bli levererad på_en söndag , vilket jag var mycket medveten om är en service som inte kan garanteras .
positive	till min stora glädje så fick min_mor sina blommor på sin födelsedag och buketten var fantastisk .
positive	större och mer färgsprakande än vad jag förväntat mig .
positive	tack euroflorist för en utmärkt service och levererande av en produkt över förväntan .
positive	first my credit_card did not do through due to incorrect billing_address .

positive	good prices , a lot of reviews of the hotels , very safe !

positive	firstly , it should be known that to complete this review , worktop_express are offering a chopping_board to customers who submit a positive_review .
positive	that said , i have absolutely no_hesitation in writing a good review for this company .
positive	i had a very long workbench to order ( nearly 0 meters ) with 0 different holes to be cut out of it ( sink , hob and downdraft extractor ).
positive	i was dealing_with zoe in their fabrication team who was always happy and polite to change my measurements either on the phone or via_email .
positive	i have to admit i was one of those annoying customers who are always changing their mind !
positive	we were having a lot of difficulty figuring_out our measurements ; length of worktop and exact position of downdraft and i never felt like it was too much problem for them to amend the drawings .
positive	which is a huge help when you have a million other things going on during the build and you want to get all of them just right .
positive	i was a bit_skeptical as to them wanting payment upfront and in full , and i actually stumbled_across this site before i ordered and paid as i was trying to discern if they were a legit company or not .
positive	it all turned_out well .
positive	the worktop fitted exactly , they delivered on the day , everything arrived in good condition , nothing was missing and it looks fantastic !
positive	i '_m very pleased with the total service of this company .

positive	then e_-_mails to confirm both had been processed successfully , and by mid - day , mt bank had been credited with a total of £_000 .
positive	you can '_t get better service than that - anywhere !

positive	my friend denise and i booked on a group trek to everest base camp never having done anything like it before and with lots of nerves about doing it .
positive	we should not have been worried , everything we could think of was covered by private_expeditions and they could not help us enough to get ready .
positive	on the trek itself our guide dorche was wonderful , good company , very supportive and really friendly .
positive	we really felt we had made a friend by the time we finished .
positive	also a special thank_you to alison who kept all our family up to date on facebook - my mum couldn_'_t wait to see your news update each day !

positive	by now very impressed and the order was delivered within the specified period .
positive	would recommend you to all my friends .
positive	hopefully will not need another bed for a few_years but would go back to dreams if i did .
positive	didn_'_t realise buying a bed could be so much fun .
positive	excellent goods , and excellent service .
positive	goods have always arrived so quickly i have never been disappointed .
positive	until i found simplysupplements i was suffering regular periods of ibs , in fact it had started to happen 0 - 0 times a week which curtailed my life no end .
positive	but since using the probiotic max for the last 0_months i have found that the episodes have reduced to about once or twice a month , so much_easier to cope with .
positive	would recommend them to anyone , in fact have been doing just that and will_continue to sing_their_praises to all who will listen .
positive	have investigated other_suppliers but the cost with simplysupplements is so much less and without_losing any of the quality .
positive	so do not_hesitate order now !!
positive	!
positive	love this site , it '_s service is quick and efficient and also a lot_cheaper_than vet '_s prices .
positive	i have recommended it to several friends all of who are as thrilled as i am as they can now afford the best for their pets .

positive	i was a little_worried_about spending nearly_£_000 with a company that i had never_heard of .
positive	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
positive	i ordered the item at 00pm on tuesday , they phoned me wednesday to confirm the postcode and it had been delivered by thursday , this is incredible given that it came from hong_kong .
positive	the item was cheaper_than all the other_companies we had looked into .
positive	we got a bundle including cleaning_kit , memory_card and a tripod for cheaper_than the price of amazon , comet etc .
positive	the only_thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard_copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
positive	i would 000_% recommend this company , they are fantastic !

positive	the prices were substantially_lower , so i was a little_bit_worried_about the quality but my fears were groundless .
positive	the swatch service was really useful , the website was easy to use and helpful , and ordering was straightforward .
positive	it was also useful to be given an estimated delivery date ( in fact the blinds arrived a day early , which was fine , and the courier was extremely nice .)
positive	the blinds are now in_situ and look great - and the blackout ones really do keep the light out , which is just what i was hoping as in scotland in midsummer it is light for a very long time .

positive	this is the first time we '_ve_used urban_sales and lettings after they were recommended to us by a friend who sold their house through them .
positive	we used them to find a tenant for our rental flat after trying a free website and getting no interest .
positive	within_00hrs of our advert going ' live ' we had 0 interested parties and an extra 0 more within that week .
positive	we got tenants that we were happy with and they moved in within a fortnight .
positive	i really liked the fact that urban sent through the contact details of anybody who showed an interest in our property to us via_text & email ( rather_than giving out our details ) so we could contact them when it was convenient .
positive	we did all the checks etc ourselves so can '_t comment on this side of their service but we would definitely use them again .

positive	it does go amber with time and exposure to light and is meant to be still effective .... but i have received very dark ambered serums from other_companies i have bought from in the past which has put me off from using them again .

positive	great carseat .
positive	we have it in our second car and then in each of the grandparents cars .
positive	really fast , efficient service from simply baby & free delivery .
positive	my only_bugbear would be that the carrier was instructed to leave it with a neighbour if we were out , but instead left it by our back door .
positive	we had been away the night before but luckily arrived back late that evening , otherwise it would have been outside overnight .
positive	excellent value for money , very quick and easy - seemed too good to be true but it was .
positive	will definitely recommend to everyone i know !
positive	i would place orders again .
positive	prices are cheap and delivery is fast .
positive	managed to pick_up a 0d blu_ray player from a local charity_shop for £_00 .

positive	thought of selling on ebay but after looking at the prices decided to go for mazuma , guaranteed prices with no_hassle of uploading_pictures or worries of will it sell .
positive	process couldn_'_t be easier and money transfer was flawless .
positive	the only improvement would be some options of what to do with the chargers , just a recommended recycle / donate option would make some more space in the cupboard !
positive	pick_up and delivery were first_class
positive	i think the team at viovet are all fantastic and excellent at thier jobs .
positive	i love getting the reminder and the speed of delivery after order is great .
positive	wouldnt_hesitate to recommend your company .

positive	the phone case itself is superb quality also , very sturdy .
positive	would recommend to anyone .
positive	ordered part and it was delivered 0_days_later --- no_problems and much_cheaper_than going to dealership and waiting a week
positive	having used auto_europe for several_years for hire from munich airport i can_honestly_say they are a great company to deal with .
positive	very helpful and polite personnel and an easy to use web_site .

positive	cannot recommend highly_enough .

positive	i enjoy wearing my new sunglasses and can recommend this company as the quality of the product was great .

positive	after breaking both wrists in a fall i needed two sturdy wrist and thumb supports to enable me to go back to work after_reading the reviews i purchased two aircast supports i ordered online and was very impressed with the speed and ease of ordering .
positive	i was kept up to date via_email every_step of the way and they arrived by courier as promised .
positive	would definately recommend physio_room to anyone
positive	pensions can be a mine_field for mere mortals but key_retirement_solutions made it easier to understand .
positive	there are so many companies these days who treat you disrespectfully when you ask simple questions all you want is someone to take time to explain your options in simple terms .
positive	i was more than satisfied with the service i have received from key_retirement_solutions and would definitely refer them to a friend .
positive	i generally look to see what the postage_costs would be before i order anything online and because there was no p_&_p with feel good i went right ahead and ordered .
positive	the price was very competitive too .
positive	i took my mother to nice and knew she is easily stressed , booking this meant she didn_'_t have to worry_about shuttle_bus , time , where did we park the car . etc .

positive	easy to order online .
positive	the prices are very fair , particularly in comparison to other main florists .
positive	it was really useful to receive text_messages and emails to let_me know when the flowers were on their way and when they had been delivered - even stated that they were left_securely on the doorstep , as i instructed if no one was home .
positive	they were sent for a birthday and the recipient was delighted with them .
positive	i would strongly_recommend serenata_flowers .
positive	i bought tickets to monty python at the o0 a few_days before the show .
positive	seatwave was ideal as they offered a collection service right next to the o0 , which is great when you are buying at short_notice or are worried_about receiving tickets in time .
positive	if this hadn_'_t been offered i probably_wouldn_'_t have been able to go as i would have been too worried_about the tickets not arriving in time .
positive	after_reading some negative_reviews of seatwave i was really worried that the tickets would not be there , or would be fake , as had happened to some people .
positive	however this was completely_unfounded - i collected the tickets from the collection_point with no_issues , there were no queues and the person working there was extremely friendly and polite .
positive	based on my experience i would recommend that seatwave are a safe and reliable_source of tickets .
positive	i '_m really glad i used them and would do so again .

positive	if you don_'_t join_topcashback you are missing out big time !
positive	in the words of one of the major_retailers ' every little helps ' - so every time you make any sort of purchase - make_sure first you go through_topcashback and you can earn back cash , be it a few_pence , a few_pounds or even a few_hundred_pounds .
positive	what '_s not to like ?
positive	it '_s so easy and before you know it - the pounds just add up - then you can treat_yourself to something nice - just for yourself - as you '_ve really ' earned ' it .

positive	i will be using your blooming beautiful services again , thank_you
positive	found this company very good reasonable_prices , was kept_informed of my product by email , was changes made and made to how i wanted it .
positive	i find this site valuable , as many of my friends and family have problems regarding money .. they are able to save for retirement , holidays and also keep upto_date with their insurances ... by comparing on this site ... also i use the money transfers companies ... having a property abroad .. very easy to use ... we also have a forum , where we try to help each other and new members to the forum ... we have great fun with the help of all the staff at money . co . uk .
positive	i tell my friends to come onto the site and have a good look
positive	very interesting ...
positive	yep , pleased to use aferry .. always a good price ....
positive	i tend to forget to ask to be parked by the lift ... due to a disability ..

positive	when my phone went dead realised needed new batteries .

positive	so at buyabattery i was very pleased to find batteries sold as singles and with simple descriptions making it easy to work out exactly which ones i needed .
positive	easy to order , delivered promptly and doing thier job well .
positive	my phone is now back in working order .
positive	bought both worming_tablets and flea_treatment for my 0 cats , flea treating the cats is easy but the worming i have to resign myself today is the day , as most people that own cats trying to get something into a cats mouth is a major_issue , though drontal is a great wormer , i just wish they would make the tablets either smaller or a tablet that a cat would eat willingly , its quite an ordeal when i have to worm my lot , some easier than others but because the tablets are quite big its hard to always get it down their throats , succesfully did all cats the last time to find a tablet on the floor which cat i do not know as i thought i had successfully done them all so who ever the culprit was this time maybe i will be more observant and not let them out of my sight until i am happy it has indeed gone done their throat ( lesson_learnt ).
positive	crushing and adding to food is a total_waste of time , they know .
positive	the cats have been flea treated this weekend , next weekend will be the worming saga , always worried their might be a reaction doing both at the same time , so always like to be on the safe side the company though are the cheapest i have found and so much_cheaper_than the vets , with 0 cats that can be quite an expense all in all highly_recommended , with a quick delivery too ..... though not happy cats at present they hate the ordeal like myself , they soon forgive me and they are protected again , until the next time
positive	ordered items , soon arrived , applied to my cats , a very easy and happy experience will buy again from this company !

positive	i knew the clarks boots i wanted , i already had a shop bought pair , but wanted a different colour so ordered them online .
positive	they were £ 0 . 00 cheaper with free delivery .
positive	they were deliverd on time however , after wearing them for a few_days i realised that inside one boot , at the heel , there was a ' nail ' or something protruding - this only became_apparent after a few_days wear due to the cushioned insole and was obviously a manufacturing_fault .
positive	i thought i may have trouble returning them as i had worn them for a few_days .
positive	i also needed them turned around quickly as they were specifically for work .
positive	so i was extremely surprised and impressed when i called rubersole , was greeted_by a very helpful young_lady , who told me there would be no problem with returning them - even_though i had worn them for a few_days , and a replacement was available but could take 00 days - due to christmas posting .
positive	i told her i could not wait 00 days and asked could i have a refund , she told me that would be absolutely fine , talked_me through the returns process ( i thought i would have to pay for the return and was very happy to be emailed a postage paid return_label ).

positive	local travel_agents were saying we could only fly from gatwick - when we have an airport on our doorstep .

positive	helen took all of our information and said to leave it with her and that she would get back to me .
positive	within an_hour or so helen called back with flights that flew everyday from our local airport , and with a price for 0 , 0 , 0 , 00 , 00 & 00 nights for half board and all_inclusive .

positive	the how to assemble video is a brilliant idea .
positive	i didn_'_t even look at the paper instructions .
positive	very pleased with our new chair .
positive	i chose this company as they seemed to have family values and treat people as individuals rather_than go to a huge company where i would be anonymous .
positive	their prices were highly competitive and their web_site was easy to use - also their feedback was good so i opted for them over and above slightly cheaper options .
positive	after the initial confirmation i didn_'_t hear from the company for a long time so i rang and was dealt_with by a charming and helpful lady_who explained , in detail , that my toaster was being made , hence the delay .
positive	i was then reassured and the rest of the transaction was perfect with good communication .
positive	my only piece of advice would be that when a delay is expected it would be good to have notice in order to keep the customer informed and unconcerned .
positive	these wewood wooden watches feel and fit just like metal watches , but much_lighter .

positive	i have replaced that watch and believe this latest version is even more slinky than the original - it feels so good and fits well .
positive	i also ordered another and sent it to my brother - he has a watch collection ( mainly expensive ) and i thought a wewood_watch a delightful and interesting addition .

positive	the price was very good too .
positive	from the initial visit by elaine the key_solutions negotiator through to our receipt of the equity_release funds this has_been a relationship that does great credit to key_solutions and to the fund_provider aviva .
positive	the time_span of march to may has_been completely problem free and considering our advanced ages something we never envisaged .
positive	not to be forgotten , is the local_solicitor used by key_solutions in featherstone who witnessed our signatures .
positive	in conclusion we cannot omit the name of debbie cummin from our praise of the relationship .
positive	placed the order the previous afternoon and it was delivered to our customer the very next_day - what service !
positive	i would never had thought about buying a battery online but was recommended by a friend and i found the whole_thing amazingly easy , quick and totally successful - even a mini_bar of chocolate as well .
positive	after years of chopping and changing supermarkets finally finding one that does everything it says on the tin has_been difficult .
positive	sainsbury '_s is the closest one to that mark , the online ordering and delivery service is 00_% foolproof , although i do find i have to switch off the substitutes as some of the replacements are questionable .
positive	delivery is always on time , the driver is polite and understanding , and they take a number of cards including electron and solo !!!
positive	which is a bonus for most people ( unlike tesco !)
positive	products are not always the cheapest however are great quality and easily replacable if they do not meet my standards .
positive	the nectar_card is great ...
positive	i use it everywhere i go and it saves me a fortune over the year ( last_year over_£_00 just over a weeks shopping ) sainsbury '_s has an easy layout of products allowing you to just pop in and grab or spend an_hour doing the weekly_shop , i do find i spend time wandering_around the home section though spending more money than i needed to and buying items that i don_'_t actually need , its very clever the way the layout is in sainsbury '_s !
positive	( or i have no self control lol ) staff are always friendly and helpful and seem to have gone_through a reasonable level of training .
positive	the scan as you shop gadgets are fab , it makes sure you don_'_t go over budget on your shop , the only annoying part is when you get up to the till and have to have a re - scan !
positive	although you can help yourself here , make_sure you scan everything that goes in your trolley or basket , the more sainsbury '_s can_trust you with your shopping the less likely you will get re - scans !
positive	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury '_s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
positive	all in all a great all_round supermarket !
positive	we have been purchasing items from 0000rpm for the last 0 years .
positive	our small business relies on fast shipping / deliveries and good quality products , which is exactly_what we get from 0000rpm .
positive	any_issues with a delivery are sorted within a very short_space of time .
positive	my exprience of 0000rpm has always been and i hope will_continue to be reliable , professional , quality and great budgeted company .
positive	items we have bought include , printers , inks , cds , cases , flash_drives , cd readers , speaker systems and various hard ware / motherboards / soundcards etc .
positive	we are overall very satisfied with thus company and shall_continue to purchase items and spread the word about them .
positive	delivery was prompt , packaging secure , delivery man lovely !

positive	the order arrives in record_time and always correct .
positive	the prices are very fair and the descriptions are second to non .
positive	if you are hesitating stop now , i can guarantee you will now be disappointed with their service so long as you read all the information and reviews .
positive	i am still in shock !
positive	after smoking for 00 years i have not had a cigerette for 0_months thanks to smokerelief .
positive	i was ' nt looking to give up , i enjoyed smoking and the more rules and regulations that came out the more determined i was that i was not going to be told what to do !
positive	but i did miss having a cig in the pub so i thought i would try e_cigs to use in places where you can not smoke .
positive	so i went online and compared different products and smokerelief is the best kit you will find for price and quality .
positive	when my kit arrived i was very apprehensive but they are great , they taste great and they are just like smoking a real cig , but without the mess and smell .
positive	the first day went by and i had ' nt looked for a real smoke so i kept going and here i am 0_months on and feeling great with no withdrawal or anxeity .
positive	as i said i '_m still in shock that is so easy !!

positive	i '_d wanted to have laser_eye_surgery since i first heard of it years_ago but always thought it would be too expensive for me so dismissed the idea before even looking in to the cost ; until last_year , when i received an offer for a free , no_obligation , consultation from optical_express .
positive	i thought , what the heck , i '_ve got nothing to loose and booked an_appointment for the following saturday .
positive	during the consultation , i was tested to see if i was suitable for laser_eye treatment , which i was , and was talked_through everything i needed to know by a really helpful , really supportive lady called jean .
positive	she '_d had laser_eye_surgery , as had most of the staff at the branch in newcastle , so she could tell me exactly_what to expect and made me feel really at ease .
positive	she also went through the various different finance packages they could offer , including an interest free option , which is the one i chose but there were so many different options that were all really affordable , which surprised me , i should have looked in to it sooner , instead of assuming i couldn_'_t afford it .
positive	i signed_up then and there .
positive	the procedure took less_than a minute i think in total and i was seeing things i '_d never seen before within a few hours !
positive	it may sound silly but one of the first things i noticed were the clouds !
positive	i '_d never seen them in that much detail , even with glasses on , i was amazed !
positive	i can_honestly_say that it '_s changed my life having_laser_eye_surgery .
positive	glasses used to give me headaches , contact_lenses were really uncomfortable , would dry my eyes out , and make me feel really tired but i don_'_t have any of these problems any more .
positive	it '_s the best purchase i '_ve ever made and would absolutely recommend the procedure to anyone .
positive	thank_you optical_express .
positive	i have shopped with trophy_store for the last three years and have found their products to be of a good quality .
positive	orders are always well_packaged , staff are polite , friendly and helpful .
positive	customer_care is good and when i had a query it was dealt_with quickly .
positive	i am pleased with the overall service of trophy_store .
positive	excellent , highly professional service .
positive	prices make a look at their website essential .
positive	i bought a part which proved to be unsuitable and this was exchanged with no problem .

positive	we hadn t decided on a name for the annex , but we soon evolved to the name swallows rest .
positive	we have an eclectic mix of out door features on the estate , carved stone troughs gargoyles sundials , all antique and in keeping .
positive	as the owner of a demolition business and salvage yard , and employing our own stone mason , i was a little_apprehensive that the finish and design criteria , wouldn t be to my husbands very high_standards , and his obsesssion with attention to detail can be very unforgiving !
positive	how lucky then , was i to have found you guys !

positive	the efficiency of information passing and follow through , from what appears to be a very robust team , was refreshing in this day and age , to say the least , delivered expressly on time at the busiest week of the year , it was a joy to engage yourselves in this task and i very much look_forward to dealing_with yourselves again as we tackle the restoration of the rest of the house and grounds .
positive	the plaque received such high accolades from my very fastidious husband , it has remained indoors at present , and hasn_'_t quite made it to its allocated spot , and all our visitors have stroked it , held it , commented on how perfect it is , and all that from i think 0 lovely chats and an e_mail .
positive	lovely to know that crafts and skills and talent remain in your corner of the world !
positive	many_thanks to all concerned !

positive	i love that you can try up to 0 different frames at any one time at home for free ( although you really have to be on the ball sending them back quickly ), and i found this much_nicer_than going into an opticians and having to try things on with a salesperson breathing_down my neck , even if it took a bit longer to work out what i liked .
positive	once i '_d chosen what i wanted , i couldn_'_t_believe_how cheap it was - and a free pair thrown in for free .
positive	my only problem was that i could only find one set of frames that i really , really liked , out of the ones i had tried , so had to make a snap decision about what my second_pair would be .
positive	when my glasses arrived ( surprisingly quickly ) i realised that the prescription had been entered into the system wrong , somehow .
positive	it must have been my mistake , and i was worried that i was going to have to pay extra for it to be changed , but i called the customer service number straight_away and spoke to a really helpful and friendly person_who sent me the return_label so i could return the glasses and get them fixed for free !

positive	great idea for reviews in one area , like minded people giving honest real opinions
positive	tried to get tickets for me and 0 friends to see taylor_swift in concert at the o0 ...
positive	this was impossible on ticketmaster as they sold out ridiculously quickly .
positive	searched for tickets on google and double 0 came up .
positive	brilliant service , quite_expensive compared to original prices , but i have the tickets !!
positive	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you !!!
positive	!
positive	yodel have been brilliant .
positive	the parcel always comes on the right day , i get texts and e_-_mails to tell me its on its way , and the driver is courteous friendly and helpful .
positive	can '_t ask for more than that .
positive	couldn_'_t_believe_how quick and efficient this service is .
positive	just as if i '_d had the thought about it , and then the products magically arrived .
positive	thankyou for making life so much_easier
positive	website easy to use and goods were delivered the following_day
positive	great contacts !!
positive	superfast delivery !!
positive	will definitely use the site again .
positive	many_thanks
positive	refunded a faulty item ( cuff - links ) quickly and also for a non - faulty item ( tie slide ) that was bought to match as the cuff - links were no_longer stocked .
positive	item arrived the next_day exactly as_described :-)
positive	fast service nice with the candy and one board magzine was a nice_surprise
positive	easy site to work around .
positive	order delivered on time , well_packaged , and very friendly , helpful staff .
positive	have recommended to others and will certainly buy from them again .
positive	very pleased with my item , great service and delivery was brilliant , service was helpful and everything was on time .
positive	really good choice of bright and stylist flowers
positive	after my daughter had her drink spiked and god only knows what could have happened , now i '_ve peace of mind_knowing i '_ve done all i can to never let this happen again
positive	not being very confident using the computer , i was pleased to find a suitable looking hotel from a lot of choice and be able to book that hotel and have e copies of the booking straight_away .
positive	an extra touch was an e_- mail a couple of days before traveling , confirming that our booking had been checked with the hotel .
positive	great looking , comfortable bar_stools at an amazingly_low price .
positive	i ordered the stools online one afternoon and they arrived ( as stated ) the next_day .
positive	fantastic service and free delivery .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for more .
positive	as well as ' free ' delivery the ' point ' system used means extra money off , which makes this website really worth using .
positive	great idea .
positive	they also have a great selection of top quality products .
positive	will definitely be using them again !
positive	this humble shop is a small paradise for hobbyists who collect blind boxed quirky figures / charms / etc .
positive	these_guys do the opening and identifying for you , so you know what exactly_what you ' re paying for , instead of dishing wads of cash on blind boxes in an vain attempt to finish your collection ( not speaking from personal experience -- honest !).
positive	if you think that sucks the fun out of collecting , then they do sell unopened_boxes to fill the needs of those feeling lucky or want a surprise .
positive	dinkybox also has a nice collection of japanese figures ( such as pinky street and revoltech ), as well as books and manga supplies .
positive	they don_'_t quite have the biggest selection around , but it '_s a nice shop with a reliable service and great prices .
positive	i '_d say it '_s worth a browse .
positive	i '_m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i '_ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i '_d say is pretty good .
positive	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
positive	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
positive	delivery is super quick , especially if you choose clothes that ' ship within 0 - 0_days '.
positive	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
positive	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will definitely use this service again .
positive	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite_expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
positive	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
positive	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
positive	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
positive	they don_'_t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
positive	if i could give cultpens more than 0_stars , i would .
positive	one of the best online stores i '_ve_used !
positive	very quick delivery ( arrived in less_than 0_days ) and an easy to use website .
positive	i would not have been disappointed if my package came a bit late in this busy christmas_period , but i '_m surprised that it managed to arrive today !
positive	the products i '_ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
positive	would use this website again , once i run_out of supplies .
positive	reliable , quick delivery .
positive	very easy to personalized your_own card .
positive	the selection of cards are fun and quirky too .
positive	highly_recommended !

positive	the price was a really competitive one and customer reviews regarding the supplier were favourable .
positive	the cleaner arrived really quickly and i enjoyed testing the product .
positive	it produced impressive results .
positive	hiring a " professional " cleaner costs per day what i paid for my very own carpet_cleaner .
positive	i recommend this product and the supplier .
positive	as usual ordering was so easy and communication from petmeds
positive	re - assuringly efficient .
positive	cat_food arrived sooner_than i expected .
positive	what more can one ask of a firm ?

positive	the vet said she had arthritis and recommend she take yumove .
positive	as it was quite_pricey , she said to look for it on - line ( very nice of her ).
positive	after scanning the internet , i came_across petmeds and not only was it the cheapest for meds , but the added_bonus was free_postage ( double_whammy ).
positive	before i ordered these meds , i asked the vets receptionist their charges .
positive	well lets just say , what i would pay for 0_months at the vets , i can get for a whole year at petmeds .
positive	and not only that , they offer a rolling repeat meds service - how clever is that .
positive	its nice to see a company that puts the needs of peoples pets before their costs , which also helps those of us who have to look after every_penny we have .

positive	delivery was free and quick , will definitely use them again .
positive	this is by far the simplest to navigate ecig business i have come_across .
positive	the ordering process is very easy to follow , payment is accepted through paypal , and delivery is usually within 0 - 0_days .
positive	can '_t fault it at all .
positive	i had a faulty product once , and they replaced it immediately no questions_asked .
positive	i don_'_t think i '_d shop anywhere_else - prices are very competitive , customer service is great , and the loyalty_scheme just tops off what is a fab shopping_experience !
positive	:)
positive	the price of my dr_martens attracted me to the site and i will return !
positive	a great service from_start to finish , a quick turn_around which didn_'_t involved couriers leaving my precious shoes in random places !
positive	i was cautious_about using this site as there were no real reviews i could find and the product was slightly cheaper .
positive	but i '_m_glad i did .
positive	the item was exactly_what i needed and the delivery was quick and hassle_free :-)
positive	the cups i ordered were of a good quality and delivered promptly on next_day delivery .
positive	i would definitely use this company again .
positive	i am a massive_fan of asos and have been for years_now .
positive	it '_s such a pleasure using their site ; really easy to navigate and ( being a picky girl ) i love the search and filter functions .
positive	my favourite part is most_likely the saved items page , this has_been so handy since it was introduced i really hope it stays as i now find every site that doesn_'_t have this to be quite a pain .
positive	i don_'_t often return things as sizing is generally spot_on with their own branded clothing and the brands they supply , but when i have had to return it has_been free and the refund is actioned really quickly .
positive	as far as issues with orders or products , this is where they shine .
positive	i had an order turn_up with a product missing ( the top of the package had been sliced , i assume at the courier depot ) and i was refunded straight_away as a replacement could not be sent .
positive	on another occasion a product turned_up and had a defect so i emailed customer_services , then shortly_after received a response offering compensation ( part refund ) so i was really chuffed to have a resolution , and a positive one !
positive	i wholeheartedly_recommend asos , really great company .
positive	web_page extremely easy to follow .
positive	clear and precise details of each item .
positive	delivery arrived as promised
positive	i am a very happy customer and plan to use drinkfinder . co . uk again .

positive	as this was our_honeymoon we wanted something special and that is exactly_what we got .
positive	we had been into several travel agencies and felt_pressurised but on speaking to the advisor tina at very cheap holidays she made us feel comfortable from_start to finish .
positive	we knew where we wanted to go and she gave_us her advice and of course fantastic price and on no occasion were we pressurised to use the company or bombarded with telephone_calls which is what we had with other_companies .
positive	she advised the hotel it was our_honeymoon and also my husbands_00th_birthday and we had a bottle of champagne chilling in our room when we arrived .
positive	we were also thankful of her suggestion of the extra baggage_allowance and felt quite smug watching everyone else panicking with their lowly 00kg .
positive	we will_definately book again with very cheap holidays and of course via tina .
positive	we ordered some thank_you cards following our_wedding after we were let_down by a friend .
positive	after much_deliberation as to which of the 000_+ photos we had we finally picked one and found creating the card quite simple ( though i had tried to create one from scratch without a photo which i found much more tricky ).
positive	we were emailed within 00_hrs to say that our cards had been despatched and would be delivered 0 - 0_days_later .
positive	unfortunately , by the 0th day they hadn_'_t arrived so i contacted optimal - they were confident that the order had been despatched so they must have been lost / delayed by the post .
positive	however , optimal offered to reprint and resend our order free of charge and they duly_arrived about 0_days_later - the quality was excellent as was their response to our problem was equally good .
positive	i would be happy to recommend them to anyone .

positive	' my experience of hotline ', brilliant , nothing is too much_trouble - i was most concerned when i had placed my order and received notification that my items had been dispatched and signed for - but i had not received these items or signed for them i contacted hotline very concerned - this was my very first order with hotline and here i was telling them that i had not received the goods and definitely not signed for them , we are a small local charity and to us the order was an expensive order that i had not received - but the order had been delivered somewhere and the order had been signed for - but who ?
positive	hotline said leave it to us we will dispatch another order to you immediately - guess_what ?
positive	this order was delivered and signed for but not to me - i contacted hotline once again to inform them i had not received the order they thought this was very strange and i agreed - i was concerned_about the company ' well you never know these days who you are dealing_with ' anyway , i received a call from hotline who told me they had found my orders they had been delivered to the local hospital because the address was the shropshire and mid - wales pituitary group the delivery company presumed it was for the local hospital - well at_least the order ( s ) had been found and i received my order plus one extra , but all credit to hotline they traced my goods , they certainly went that extra_mile , giving that all important 000_% customer service .

positive	getting paid money to click through a link on a website to do my normal internet_shopping ?
positive	there has to be a catch - but there isn_'_t .
positive	over the years i have received hundreds of pounds by making my final purchase through_topcashback rather_than going straight through the company '_s own site .
positive	i put the things in my basket on the company website , then go to topcashback to see if it '_s one of their merchants .
positive	if it is , i click their link and hey_presto , the items are still in the basket and i just have to pay .
positive	it '_s particularly good for insurance .
positive	i search around , decide which policy i want and then click the link on topcashback .
positive	it really is that easy .

positive	i was not disappointed the whole_transaction being prompt and pleasant .
positive	thank_you etyres i shall_certainly think of you again although hopefully , not in the very near_future .
positive	i have used event_tyres now at_least 0 times both at home and at work and have found the tyre_fitters amiable , efficient and trustworthy .
positive	their prices are generally better_than tyre shops and obviously more convenient because they come to you .
positive	i would definitely recommend event_tyres .

positive	i '_ve always wanted to use a professional lens .
positive	they cost £ 0 , 000 '_s to buy which i can '_t afford .
positive	hiring a lens is a great way to use your dream lens at a fraction of the cost and enjoy the rewards of fantastic photo '_s .
positive	the hiring process at lenses for hire was seamless and i am thrilled with my pics and will consider hiring another lens when on holiday again .
positive	do however consider the size and weight of the lens you are hiring as this needs consideration while transiting .
positive	have fun !
positive	today we travelled a hundred mile_round_trip to visit drum_stop with my son .
positive	he has had a 0th hand kit for over a year and just passed his rock school exams and we felt he deserved a brand_new kit now .
positive	my son matthew has a range of very complex disabilities including autism / pda and leg deformaties .
positive	when we arrived craig the gm looked after us .
positive	he is absolutely fantastic !!
positive	we all learnt so much as craig spent time talking us through how drums are made , the different manufacturers , how to tune the drums etc .
positive	we '_d had a possible idea of the drums we wanted to get before arrival - a mid range kit possibly peart / yamaha / mapex but going through the extensive displays and listening to craig matthew settled on the yamaha stage custom birch .
positive	craig was so wonderful with matthew , very kind , respectful and helpful and i cannot strongly_recommend him highly_enough to other parents who have disabled children who play the drums to visit .
positive	matthew was so happy with his kit but also with the time craig spent with us as he learnt so much , had the opportunity to play the yamaha drums , and the fact that he coped in the environment as craig made us all feel so welcome .
positive	the package was really good ( and the price ) and we have also chosen for craig to build / tune the set , and to have it delivered during the week .
positive	even_though we '_ve not go the kit just yet i wanted to post a review purely for the customer service as it is so exceptional .
positive	so thank_you so much craig and the drum_stop team - you deliver the best customer service ever and you gave matthew such a boost - smiles all around !!

positive	i was unfortunate to be caught up in a motorway closure on the m00 on september 0th ..
positive	diverted off at ashford so missed my 0 . 00pm sailing .
positive	no problem , i knew i would be able to get on the 0pm ..... the traffic was horrendous and i arrived at dover at 0 . 00pm .
positive	no problem said the very pleasant check in staff ( they always are !).
positive	we can get you on the 0pm .
positive	relief although quite stressed by this time .
positive	. 0 . 00pm ... time to board ... oh no , starter motor jammed !!
positive	almost in tears by this stage but can '_t show out as a weak woman !!
positive	!
positive	the loading stewards were very helpful and suggested that if i could get a breakdown to me within the hour they would guarantee me a 0pm sailing .
positive	it gets_worse .... no breakdown can get to me as they are all on call or stuck in the m00 traffic .
positive	then there was steve , what a smiley helpful reassuring man , think he was a loading supervisor / manager .
positive	he got the two loading staff to help give me a push start , and at the second_attempt it started .
positive	next problem ... car deck all full .... steve radioed up to the loading area and begged for a small space for me .
positive	managed to get on at the back of all the lorries on the lorry deck just as the ferry pulled away .
positive	marvellous staff ... always travel dfds , always will !!!
positive	steve , don_'_t know your surname but you were my hero .
positive	many_thanks .

positive	the villa was superb .
positive	spotlessly_clean , well_equipped with everything you could_possibly_need , including a pool_table , wii , ipod_dock and even a bath on the balcony !
positive	the decor was beautiful and views right on the sea front were fabulous .

positive	we would definitely use villa_plus again .
positive	they should be very proud of their service and their fantastic staff .
positive	thank_you for an amazing holiday !
positive	after struggling to fill in the order online i had to ring the customer service team twice for help .
positive	both lads were very helpful but in particular oliver , who talked_me through step by step .
positive	as it was a delivery to scotland there was confusion_over the postcode , but i eventually completed the form and took the item to my local drop_off and here '_s hoping !
positive	!
positive	many_thanks for helping a 00 year_old who is not that savvy with computers .
positive	i could only get the product i needed from the doctor in 000g tubes but as i can use as much as i want when i want i was always running out and the prescription charge put me off using it all up .
positive	then a friend introduced me to chemists direct and for the price of two prescriptions i bought the same thing in 000g pump action dispensers ( which in themselves made life so much_easier ) and i am not afraid to use it , as i know i can always get some more i no_longer have to scratch all day and i can leave the house , i have a life .
positive	all this is down to chemist_direct selling products at a reasonable_price .
positive	thank_you so much chemist_direct .
positive	first time i '_ve ordered contact_lenses online .
positive	very user_friendly site .
positive	fast delivery and good prices .
positive	0 years_ago i had an eye_test and was told i needed glasses for seeing things close to me and i bought a pair from one of the leading opticians on the high_street , at the time i was 00 so i got some money off however they were still £_00 .
positive	i found them so hard to use because they were quite a small frame , they made me feel very dizzy and sick because of the difference that i could see from the outsides of the frames .
positive	recently i have been getting terrible headaches and a pain behind my left eye , so i had an eye_test and found that my left eye had worsened .
positive	being a student , and getting no money off with nhs left me struggling with what to do as i could not afford a pair of glasses that would not make me feel ill ( very large framed ones ) from a high_street_opticians so i took to the internet searching for cheap online glasses .
positive	i came_across glasses_direct and after browsing their glasses came_across a huge_selection of large framed glasses .
positive	i was over the moon when i saw there home_trial option , so selected 0 pairs to try .
positive	they received so fast and when i got them i was so pleased with them .
positive	i immediately ordered the pair and was informed that i would get a free pair .
positive	i also noticed that they had a 00_%_off code for halloween .
positive	in the end i got 0 pairs of glasses worth £_00 each for a mere £_00 including delivery !
positive	i am so pleased with my glasses and the extra pair means i can keep one at home and one in my bag so i never forget them when i go to uni .
positive	such a good deal , such good glasses , and such good service .
positive	easy site to look at and use - good description of product that was purchased - excellent price - fantastic delivery service .
positive	happy to pass details of product to other people and have done so .
positive	bought two of these for my sons bedrooms .
positive	they love them !
positive	best buy in a very long time !
positive	i am extremely happy with the service provided by this company .
positive	my item was dispatched very quickly and i was kept_updated about its location every_step of the way .
positive	thank_you very much for such a professional service .
positive	i have already_recommended this company to others and will_continue to do so !
